1|People have an inherent desire to know the truth.
1|That, or they want to believe that what they know is the truth.
1|1818 1975 1988 1999
1|In other words, the truth itself is merely secondary.
1|So in this story, you should be constantly wary of what's true and what's not.
1|I recommend you stay doubtful and have a heart of stone as you read it.
1|Though it would be unlike me to not mention that you might've already fallen into my trap at that point.
1|Well then.
1|Allow me to mix fact and fiction together in a web of truth and lies
1|as I narrate to you Senjougahara Hitagi and Araragi Koyomi's love story.

1|Would someone who fell victim to a scam and went through some terrible things
1|really want to deceive someone else?
1|How interesting.
1|It piques my curiosity.
1|A girl like that—
1|I don't know who she is, but either way, she wants me to be her accomplice in a scam?
1|Could this situation be any more unnatural?

1|Actually, I'm on my way to meet you. I'm almost at the airport already.
1|Oh, really?
1|I made my client go through the trouble of traveling to see me, so it's the least I could do.
1|Let's meet at the airport lobby.
1|My, I'm so grateful for your consideration.
1|Here I was thinking you'd flown to Okinawa from somewhere else in Japan.
1|That you'd only just reached the airport, just like me.

1|Very well.
1|Let's do that, then.
1|Should I just let you know where I am by phone once I get there?
1|Oh, no.

1|Long time no see, Suzuki.
1|Scene no. 165
1|I didn't expect you to get in touch with me.
1|What's wrong? Did something happen?
1|There's someone I want you to deceive.
1|Could you deceive them for me?
1|I can't say anything if you're being that vague.
1|Of course, there's not a person in this world I can't deceive,
1|but I can't give you an answer unless I hear the specifics.
1|While you don't have a better social standing, you are older than me,
1|so I'm showing you some respect by making this a job request.
1|In truth, this is something you're duty-bound to do.
1|What's that supposed to mean? You mean this is my atonement?
1|Are you telling me to make it up to you for hurting you in the past?
1|Well, how should I say this?
1|How you've grown, Senjougahara.
1|And not just your best assets.
1|You won't be making it up to me.
1|Araragi already healed the wounds you gave me.
1|Oh? That's wonderful. You two seem very much in love.
1|So you'll be making amends for something completely different.
1|You have to, no matter what.
1|I can't say I'm too happy with being forced to do things.
1|I could stand up walk away right this moment, you know?
1|Do that and I'll stab you.
1|Don't think I've come unprepared.
1|I'd rather not get stabbed.
1|Very well. I'll hear you out.
1|I don't know if I'll listen to you, though.
1|Let's hear it, Senjougahara.
1|Who exactly do you want me to deceive?
1|For some reason, the way you're speaking makes me feel it's someone I know.
1|Sengoku Nadeko.
1|Scene no. 192
1|Does Araragi know about you meeting me today?
1|To begin with, aren't couples supposed to go on shrine visits together on New Year's Day?
1|You know, throwing money away and all that.
1|Don't you make fun of me.
1|Of course he doesn't know.
1|He might end up killing you if he sees you, after all.
1|I mean, he's a hero of justice and you're like his arch-enemy.
1|He doesn't know, eh?
1|So basically, you came to see me in secret.
1|And what of it?
1|It's not something you need to confirm multiple times, or even once for that matter.
1|Nothing, really.
1|So what,
1|you're willing to waste your last winter break as a high schooler—one that you could be spending with Araragi?
1|You're willing to keep a secret from your boyfriend so you can be an accomplice in a scam?
1|I don't know who this Sengoku Nadeko is,
1|but is she your rival in love or something?
1|Araragi's got his college entrance exams soon, anyway.
1|It doesn't matter if it's winter break or New Year's Day. He has to study all the time.
1|Well, I don't know how smart he is,
1|but he should do all right if you're constantly by his side, helping him study.
1|Come this spring, I'm sure you'll both be college students.
1|No.
1|At this rate, Araragi and I won't live past spring.
1|We won't have a future.
1|You see, the two of us will be killed on graduation day if things don't change.
1|Oh?
1|So, the two of you are in danger of being killed by this Sengoku Nadeko
1|because you did something to incur her wrath,
1|and now you want me to talk her out of it, I presume?
1|Pretty much.
1|I have to say, getting killed doesn't sound very nice.
1|It doesn't, no.
1|It sounds scary. Terrifying, even.
1|Mind if I tell you what happened,
1|Kaiki?
1|You only have to listen.
1|If you don't want to take up this job, I won't force you to.
1|Araragi and I will resign ourselves to our fate and let her kill us.
1|If that's how things are meant to be, then so be it.
1|Actually, I might be able to save Araragi by begging and pleading with all I've got.
1|With that as my last remaining hope, I'll live out the last two and a half months of my life.
1|How gloomy.
1|Scene no. 227
1|However,
1|Scene no. 230
1|Very well. I don't mind hearing you out.
1|There are cases where talking to someone takes a load off your mind and solves everything, after all.
1|I answered thus.
1|Scene no. 234
1|Scene no. 235
1|I did say there was a person I wanted you to deceive,
1|but Sengoku Nadeko's no longer a person.
1|Oh? That's interesting.
1|What is she if not a person?
1|A god.
1|She's become a snake god.
1|It happened last November.
1|Let's just hear her out.
1|Scene no. 245
1|You say she became a god.
1|Is it safe to assume she fell prey to an odd disease like you did?
1|Odd Disease
1|Scene no. 247
1|That's right.
1|Odd Disease
1|Scene no. 249
1|An odd disease.
1|They were both gods, after all.
1|Mine was a crab, and hers, a snake.
1|Yeah, an odd disease indeed.
1|You used to work in that town, so maybe you've heard of this?
1|On top of the mountain, there's a shrine called the Shrine of the Polar Snake.
1|That's where she's being deified now.
1|Can't say I've ever heard of that shrine.
1|Is what I answered.
1|Scene no. 257
1|Of course I know it.
1|Scene no. 258
1|Frankly speaking, I have no idea what "being deified" is supposed to mean.
1|Are you saying Sengoku Nadeko's currently being worshipped as a living god?
1|Living God
1|Scene no. 260
1|Maybe as one that performs miracles?
1|Walking God
1|Scene no. 262
1|She's a bit different.
1|She kinda swallowed a god whole.
1|Either way, Sengoku Nadeko's no longer human, but a kind of monster.
1|What I'm trying to say is that she turned into something truly absurd.
1|Something so absurd she could destroy that entire town if she felt like it.
1|How did she end up catching that odd disease?
1|Going by what you're saying, she sounds like a schoolmate of yours.
1|She's not.
1|Sengoku Nadeko is a middle schooler.
1|What year?
1|Second.
1|Kaiki, are you doing this on purpose?
1|Do you really have no recollection whatsoever of the name Sengoku Nadeko?
1|If she's a middle schooler in your town,
1|then she must be one of the middle schoolers I tricked last year.
1|No, to be precise...
1|She wasn't one of your direct victims.
1|She was a victim of your victims.
1|An indirect victim, I guess?
1|Oh, so it's like a chain bankruptcy caused by a scam, huh?
1|Broke
1|Yeah, scams are a social evil that cause more than just individual harm. They have a domino effect.
1|Broke
1|Sir!
1|Excuse me! The lady ended up spilling her orange soda.
1|Sorry, but please get her another glass.
1|Stop treating me like a child.
1|I'm sorry.
1|I acted inappropriately for someone making a request.
1|Don't worry.
1|Adults don't get mad at every single mistake children commit.
1|Anyway, you may have only done so indirectly,
1|but you're still the person responsible for getting Sengoku Nadeko mixed up in the world of oddities.
1|I'm sure that makes even a lump of evil like you feel a little bit guilty.
1|Oh, I totally do!
1|I'm so wracked by guilt I could die!
1|I have to atone for this no matter what.
1|I'll do whatever it takes.
1|Tell me, Senjougahara.
1|What should I do?
1|Like I've been saying, deceive Sengoku Nadeko the god and save both Araragi and me.
1|Help me.
1|Scene no. 292
1|I remember hearing those words two years ago.
1|I wonder how it feels to say something you once did to the same person again.
1|I wonder how it feels.
1|Save them?
1|Me? Save Senjougahara and Araragi?
1|The wording felt somewhat like a bad joke.
1|And since I don't particularly hate bad jokes, it made me somewhat happy.
1|You're telling me to deceive a god?
1|You can do that, can't you?
1|I mean, you call yourself the best scamster in the world.
1|What good are you if you can't even pull that off?
1|I did not say that.
1|Scene no. 301
1|What, you don't believe in yourself?
1|But I do.
1|Or rather, who needs self-belief to deceive some measly god?
1|There's nothing in this world I can't deceive.
1|So you can trick that murderous girl into letting Araragi and me live?
1|I can.
1|To be more precise, you'll have to save me, Araragi, and his slave of sorts—a little blonde girl.
1|Easy.
1|I could even handle an additional five slaves.
1|I see. Then—
1|However, I only said I can.
1|Whether I will do it is a different matter altogether.
1|To begin with, I only deceive people for money.
1|Why must I deceive this Sengoku Nadeko girl if I don't stand to profit from it?
1|She may be a god, but she's still only a middle schooler. Tricking her would hurt my conscience!
1|I'll pay. Do you even need to ask?
1|Of course I do. I'm not sure you can.
1|I'll pay you.
1|I can ready a hundred thousand yen in a lump sum.
1|That's how much I paid Oshino when he helped me out.
1|Back when he cured me of my odd disease.
1|Then pay the same price again and ask Oshino for help.
1|I can't find him, search as I might.
1|Hanekawa even went abroad to look for him.
1|Hanekawa?
1|My friend and classmate.
1|She's a girl with large breasts.
1|I know the answer already, but let me bank on a miracle and ask you anyway, Kaiki.
1|What is it?
1|To help Araragi and me, who you caused trouble for in the past,
1|and to make amends for what you did to Sengoku Nadeko,
1|are you willing to work for free?
1|That wouldn't even happen if Hell froze over.
1|Is a hundred thousand yen not enough?
1|No, that's not enough.
1|Then be specific. How much would I have to pay?
1|How much would it take for you to deceive Sengoku Nadeko?
1|State your demands.
1|The hundred thousand can be an advance payment.
1|I'll prepare an appropriate sum for you later.
1|I guess you can get pretty desperate when your life's on the line.
1|Or does this stem from the desire to keep your boyfriend alive?
1|What if you could only save either Araragi or yourself with what you can afford?
1|Who would you choose?
1|Araragi, obviously.
1|My, my.
1|There are exactly seventy-four days until graduation.
1|That's enough time to prepare a rather large sum of money.
1|I wouldn't mind selling my body if it came down to it.
1|Where can I find the toilet?
1|It's time for a soliloquy.
1|Do I have it in me to work for free to help Senjougahara and Araragi?
1|Do I feel like I can't stand by and watch as my former rivals die?
1|Black
1|Unnumbered Scene
1|No. Definitely not.
1|If anything, that would only please me.
1|Can I do something to help this Sengoku Nadeko girl who's suffering from an odd disease, then?
1|Black
1|Unnumbered Scene
1|No.
1|Who the hell is she?
1|I couldn't care less.
1|Then what about the innocent girl I deceived in the past?
1|What if I base it off a desire to make it up to her?
1|Not because she's a rival, but because she's an old acquaintance.
1|Do I feel like I want to help Senjougahara or her family?
1|Black
1|Unnumbered Scene
1|No, I don't.
1|I think nothing of what happened in the past.
1|Even if one of my scams forced a girl into prostitution,
1|my way of life wouldn't change one bit.
1|What about Araragi, then?
1|I did torment his little sister.
1|I also sold information about him to Kagenui for money.
1|How about returning the favor—repaying my debt—by saving his life?
1|Black
1|Unnumbered Scene
1|No.
1|Even if I owed him anything, this wouldn't be a fair deal.
1|Just my travel expenses so far would be enough to write that off.
1|What's left?
1|Oh, right. The Hanekawa girl.
1|How about being moved by the extremes to which that girl's willing to go to help her friends?
1|Or, she could be filthy rich.
1|I could have her parents repay me.
1|Black
1|Unnumbered Scene
1|No.
1|It did not require a moment's consideration,
1|Scene no. 364
1|nor to properly finish my sentence.
1|Scene no. 364
1|This isn't working.
1|No matter how much I think about it, I can't think of a reason to take this job.
1|Forget not standing to make a profit, taking it would only cause me loss.
1|Oh wait.
1|Come to think of it, she lives in that town.
1|Gaen's niece.
1|That is to say, the memento of sorts of her elder sister—Gaen Tooe's lone daughter.
1|If I'm not mistaken, her surname's different now. She's Kanbaru Suruga.
1|Kanbaru Suruga.
1|A student of Naoetsu High School,
1|and once a close friend of Senjougahara.
1|The first time I met Araragi was in front of the Kanbaru residence, too.
1|Let's say there's a link between Araragi and her.
1|Then I should obviously assume there's one between Senjougahara and her too.
1|Even if there isn't one there, I know for a fact that there's one between Araragi and her, at least.
1|If it's to help Kanbaru Suruga, can I save my hated foes Senjougahara and Araragi?
1|Can I deceive Sengoku Nadeko for her?
1|Yes.
1|I'm sure
1|that even if all my wishes were to come true
1|I'd come to desire something else
1|and come to regret it in turn
1|My love and the time I lacked
1|will be my path into the future
1|There's someone I love
1|There's someone I love,
1|and we haven't even managed to accept the fact
1|that this has become normal for us
1|We feel so irritated,
1|but today we grew a little more confident again,
1|so that tomorrow we can laugh
1|and say that we are happy

2|Humans have a desire for truth.
2|Or they have a desire to believe that what they know is the truth.

2|In other words, the actual truth comes second to that desire.
2|Be mindful of what is truth and what is a lie.
2|In other words, always doubt yourself. Harbor an inner devil's advocate as you read along...
2|And I won't forget to add that by that point, you might have already fallen into my trap.
2|Now then, here's a tale where lies and truth intertwine,

2|1st of January
2|That day, I was at some famous shrine in Kyoto, Japan.
2|It's New Year's Day.
2|I was at a shrine on New Year's Eve to ring in the new year, so to say.
2|And that's a lie. It was partially for fun, to observe visitors...
2|...throwing away money, more important than their lives, as if it were nothing but trash.
2|I came to a shrine to study the ecology of people of that nature.
2|That story sounds pretty legit, but the actual reason may be completely different.

2|Hello, Kaiki? It's me, Senjougahara Hitagi.
2|Tamikura-sou
2|There is someone I'd like you to deceive.
2|Don't play dumb. This is Kaiki, right?
2|My name is Suzuki.
2|Suzu, as in a bell on a collar, and ki like giving a blunt answer.
2|Excuse me, who'd you call? And Senjougahara? I have no recollection of such a name.
2|I see. Then Suzuki's fine. Rather than Senjougahara, we can say I'm Senshougahara.
2|Senshougahara Hitagi
2|Senshougahara. Who's that?

2|I'd like to meet and talk, so where should I go? Where are you now anyway?
2|Okinawa. In a cafe in Naha, Okinawa. I'm eating a morning set in the cafe.
2|Got it. I'll head there now. My shoes are already on.
2|I'll call when I'm at the airport. You'd better keep your phone on.
2|If my call doesn't go through, I'll kill you.
2|I'm leaving this in your hands.
2|She's leaving this in my hands.
2|In any case...

2|On that day, due to the silly lie I made, I had no choice but to head down to Okinawa.

2|Would she, a girl whose identity I don't know, have someone that she wants to deceive?
2|Would someone who suffered as a victim of fraud think of fooling someone the same way?
2|Interesting. I have to look at this with an inquisitive eye.
2|Such a girl... I don't know who she is, but asking me of all people to be an accomplice in her fraud...
2|...is the epitome of unnatural.
2|In that respect, I just feel something's wrong. If I had to rephrase...
2|...it's not that I feel something's wrong. I just have a bad feeling.
2|Kaiki? I'm here.
2|Who's that? I said my name was Suzuki, Senshougahara-san.
2|That's enough of the unnatural acting. Stop with the childish behavior already.
2|Emergency Exit
2|Where should I head?
2|Senshougahara-san. Actually, I'm already near the airport in an effort to pick you up.
2|I see.
2|Since you took the time to come down as my client, I felt it natural.
2|Therefor, we should meet in the airport lobby.
2|Oh my, I'm grateful for your thoughtfulness.
2|I totally thought you just flew in to Okinawa...
2|...from elsewhere in Japan, and just arrived at the airport like me.
2|I have no clue as to what you are alluding.
2|Buy a Ryuukyuu Beauty as your souvenir!

2|Lobby is such an abstract location. Can I meet you in a cafe or something inside the airport?
2|All right. We can do that.
2|After I enter the cafe, should I call you to tell you the shop's name?
2|I'll walk through every cafe in the airport to make sure I'm the one who greets you.
2|Okinawa
2|Okinawa Soba
2|So Senshougahara-sama, please elegantly have some tea and wait a bit.
2|After all, this is our first meeting.
2|I'll have some glasses on, so use that as your sign that it's me.
2|All right. I win.
2|Hot coffee, please. And one more glass of orange juice for this lady.
2|It's been a while, Senshougahara.
2|It's been a while, Suzuki.
2|To think that you'd be the one contacting me.
2|What's wrong? Something happen?
2|There is someone I'd like you to deceive.
2|Would you be up for the deception?
2|I'm troubled that the request is very vague.
2|Of course, there is no human that I cannot deceive...
2|...but without a more concrete story, I can't give an answer.
2|Even if you're not respectable, I'm trying to save your face as you are older than me.
2|That is why I'm taking the format of a commission.
2|Fundamentally, you have to do something of this level to begin with.
2|What's up with that?
2|Are you talking about atonement?
2|Because I previously got you into a terrible situation, I have to make up for it?
2|That's, you know...
2|...showing growth on your part, Senjougahara. On something other than your boobs...
2|It's not to make up for something you've done against me.
2|All the pain you caused me has already been made up by Araragi-kun.
2|Oh, well that's splendid. Not a cheap shot.
2|So, you're making up for something completely different.
2|And you must do it.
2|I'm slightly disgusted by having my actions limited like that.
2|I mean, I can turn away and go home right now.
2|If you do that, I'll stab you.
2|Don't think that I came here without making any preparations.
2|I don't want to be stabbed.
2|I have no choice. I'll at least listen to your story.
2|Though I don't know if I'll do it after hearing the story out...
2|Go ahead, tell me, Senjougahara. Who and where do you want me to deceive?
2|From how you've been talking, it sounds like someone I know.
2|Sengoku Nadeko.
2|Does Araragi know about this?
2|That you're seeing me like this on New Year's day.
2|In the first place, aren't couples supposed to do the New Year's shrine visits together...
2|...and carelessly throw money away like trash?
2|Don't mock me. Of course he doesn't know.
2|If Araragi-kun were to see you, he'd be likely to kill you.
2|To that hero of justice, you are a natural enemy.
2|He doesn't know, so...
2|In other words, you came here to meet me in secret without Araragi knowing.
2|What of it?
2|Is that something you repeatedly, or even once, need to confirm?
2|No, not really.
2|So, what is it? To spend valuable time during your last winter break in high school with Araragi...
2|In other words, you want to become an accomplice to a fraud so much...
2|...that you created a secret you're keeping from your boyfriend.
2|I have no idea who this Sengoku Nadeko is. Is she a rival for his heart or something?
2|In the first place, Araragi-kun is preparing for college entrance exams...
2|...so he's stuck studying, whether it's winter break or New Year's Day.
2|Well, I don't know how well Araragi does academically...
2|...but if you're attending to his studies all the time, I'm sure he has no problems either.
2|Both of you will be in college in the spring.
2|No.
2|At this rate, Araragi-kun and I won't have a spring or anything after.
2|Hmm?
2|We have no future.
2|Hmm?
2|Araragi-kun and I, if everything goes according to plan, are going to be murdered on graduation day.
2|I see...
2|So, something is going against you and Araragi for some reason...
2|...and this Sengoku Nadeko wants to kill both of you,
2|so you want me to wheedle her into not doing so?
2|For the most part, you're correct.
2|Still, murder is something far from peaceful.
2|Right. It's not peaceful. It's very scary. Very ominous.
2|Can I tell you in a bit more detail, Kaiki-san?
2|All you have to do is listen. If you say no, then I'll give up.
2|I'll give in and submit both me and Araragi-kun to die at her hands.
2|If that is destiny that I can't avoid, then so be it.
2|No, if I were to plead with all my heart, maybe Araragi-kun will be spared.
2|I'll use that as my only hope to live the last two and a half months of my life.
2|All right, I can just listen.
2|After getting it off your chest, you might feel better, and everything may work out.
2|I did say there was someone I'd like you to deceive.
2|But Sengoku Nadeko is no longer a human.
2|Oh? This is interesting. If she isn't human, what is she?
2|A god.
2|She became a deity of snakes. That was November of last year.
2|By becoming a god, do you mean...
2|...that she has an odd disease like the one you had? Is that how I should think of it?
2|Yes, right.
2|An odd disease, indeed.
2|It's true that we were both gods. I had a crab, and she has a snake.
2|Yes, an odd disease in a way.
2|You did a job back in that town, so maybe you know...
2|...that there is a shrine named North Shirahebi Shrine atop the mountain.
2|That is where she is enshrined right now.
2|No, I don't know of any shrines by that name.
2|But I don't understand what you mean by saying she's enshrined there.
2|In other words, is Sengoku Nadeko a living deity that people show faith in?
2|A living deity, in human form?
2|It's slightly different from things of that sort.
2|How to put it... She swallowed a god into her stomach.
2|In any case, Sengoku Nadeko is no longer human...
2|...and has turned into a monstrous abberation.
2|I see.
2|In other words...
2|Sengoku Nadeko has become an incredible existence that common sense can't explain.
2|An existence at a level that could crush that entire town if she wanted to.
2|How did she come across such an odd disease in the first place?
2|From the sounds of it, I'm assuming that she's one of your classmates...
2|Not so. Sengoku Nadeko is still in junior high.
2|What grade?
2|She's a second year.
2|Hey, Kaiki, are you asking on purpose?
2|Hmm?
2|Does the name Sengoku Nadeko really not ring a bell?
2|That town... That town you live in, and she's in junior high...
2|In other words, she's one of the junior high kids I deceived last year?
2|Strictly speaking, that's not true.
2|Sengoku Nadeko was not a direct victim of your deception.
2|She was a victim of one of your victims. I guess an indirect victim.
2|I see.
2|Let's see... Fraud creates a chain reaction of victimization...
2|...and that's why it's a menace to society that can't fit into the confines of the individual.

2|Excuse me...
2|I'm sorry! She spilled her orange juice.
2|I hate to inconvenience you, but can you get her one more glass, please?
2|Don't treat me like a child.
2|I'm sorry.
2|That's not the attitude of someone about to ask for a favor.
2|Don't worry. Adults don't get upset at each mishap a child has.
2|In any case, even if indirectly...
2|...you were the one who dragged Sengoku Nadeko into the world of abberations.
2|If you can think that way, don't even man-eating fiends like you feel a bit of responsibility?
2|I do, I do! The responsibility is crushing me to death.
2|I absolutely have to make up for it.
2|I'll make up for it at any cost.
2|Tell me Senjougahara, what do you want me to do?
2|I'm telling you.
2|Deceive Sengoku Nadeko, who is now a god, and save me and Araragi-kun.
2|I heard those words two years ago too.
2|I wonder how it feels to say the same line to the same person again.
2|I wonder how it feels.
2|To save.
2|I save Senjougahara and Araragi.
2|That all sounded like one bad joke.
2|And since I'm not one to dislike bad jokes, it put me in a pretty cheerful mood.
2|So you're telling me to deceive a god?
2|You can do that much, right?
2|You claimed that you're the best con artist on the planet,
2|so if you can't do it, what are you going to do?
2|What? Do you have no confidence?
2|I do.
2|Or rather, I don't need mere confidence to deceive a god.
2|There is nothing that I can't deceive.
2|Then, you can deceive that girl filled with murderous intent...
2|...and wheedle her into letting me and Araragi-kun live?
2|I can.
2|Strictly speaking, it's me, Araragi-kun, and the blonde girl that is Araragi-kun's loli-slave.
2|So easy. I'm perfectly fine even if there are five more loli-slaves.
2|I see. Then...
2|But I'm only talking about how I can do it. Whether I'll do it or not is another matter.
2|In the first place, I deceive people for money.
2|Why do I have to deceive Sengoku Nadeko when it doesn't bring in any money at all?
2|Even if she's a god, to fool a girl in junior high makes my conscience hurt oh so much.
2|Money... is something I'll pay, of course.
2|I don't think you have enough of an income to say "of course."
2|I'll pay the money.
2|For starters, I can make a spot payment of 100,000 yen.
2|This is the price I paid Oshino-san when he helped me out.
2|Back when Oshino-san fixed my odd disease...
2|Then, you can take that money and ask Oshino again for this case.
2|I can't find Oshino-san. I've been looking for him.
2|Hanekawa-san even went overseas for me to look for him.
2|Hanekawa?
2|Hanekawa-san is one of my friends and classmates. She has big boobs.
2|I already know the answer, but I'm betting on miraculous odds for now.
2|Kaiki, can I at least ask a question?
2|What is it?
2|Do you not intend to work for free for me and Araragi-kun?
2|That is, to make up for what you did to Sengoku Nadeko and for the trouble you caused us?
2|That would never happen even if heaven and earth flipped over.
2|Is 100,000 yen not enough?
2|Well, it's not enough.
2|So just how much do I have to pay you to deceive Sengoku Nadeko for me?
2|Demand an amount.
2|You can call the 100,000 yen your down payment.
2|I'll prepare an amount that won't insult you.
2|You're really desperate when it concerns your life.
2|Or do you feel that your boyfriend's life is so important?
2|At the absolute limit that you could afford to pay...
2|...if you could only spare one life, which would you pick? Your life or Araragi's?
2|Araragi-kun. That's a given.
2|Well, now...
2|There are exactly 74 days until graduation.
2|Given that much time, I can prepare a lump sum of money.
2|If I need to, I can sell my own body too.
2|Excuse me, where's the bathroom?
2|Now, time to ask myself.
2|Do I feel like I want to work for Senjougahara and Araragi for free?
2|Do I feel like I can't bear to watch old rivals lose their lives in an unsightly manner?
2|That's a no. That would never be true.
2|If anything, I'd feel relief.
2|Then, would I be able to do anything for free for this girl named Sengoku Nadeko...
2|...who apparently contracted an odd illness?
2|That's a no. Who the hell is she?
2|No clue.
2|Then, what if I base it on a desire to repay Senjougahara,
2|an honest girl whom I previously deceived?
2|Not as a rival, but as an old acquaintance.
2|Do I feel like I want to do something for Senjougahara as a person, or for her family?
2|That's a no. I don't feel like that at all.
2|I feel nothing toward that old case.
2|Even if, as a result of my fraud, the daughter of the family decides to sell herself out,
2|it wouldn't affect how I live one bit.
2|Then, what about Araragi?
2|Right... I bullied his younger sister once.
2|I also sold information about him once to wrestle some money out of Kagenui.
2|As a small repayment for that, like giving change, how about I save his life?
2|That's a no. Even if there was change for me to give back, it wouldn't be enough.
2|Such an amount was already used up just by coming here.
2|Who else? Oh, right, that girl named Hanekawa?
2|How about I be touched by a girl's admirable efforts to go overseas for the sake of a friend?
2|Or perhaps she is amazingly rich.
2|And maybe I can wrestle some money from her parents?
2|That's a no.
2|Hmph, no good. No matter how hard I think, I can't find a reason to accept this job.
2|Not only is there nothing in it for me, but I'd end up with a loss if I accepted.
2|Oh, wait.
2|Come to think of it, that town is where she is...
2|The niece of Gaen-senpai...
2|In other words, the daughter...
2|...with which to remember Gaen-senpai's older sister, Gaen Toue, lives there.
2|I believe her last name has changed and is now Kanbaru Suruga.
2|Kanbaru Suruga is a student at Naoetsu High...
2|...and wasn't she good friends with Senjougahara once too?
2|The first time I met Araragi was in front of Kanbaru's house.
2|So if Araragi is connected to Kanbaru...
2|...it's natural to think that Senjougahara has some sort of connection to Kanbaru as well.
2|And even if she doesn't, I'm at least certain that Kanbaru and Araragi are connected.
2|Whew.
2|Can I save my bitter enemies Senjougahara and Araragi, and deceive Sengoku Nadeko...
2|...for the sake of Kanbaru Suruga?
2|That's a yes.
2|kitto ne kiri ga nai koto
2|I'm sure that after

2|Have I?

2|Speaking of Tsukihi-chan, I'm dreaming of getting a pie haircut, however...

2|You made us change hairstyles once, saying it was the age of ponytails.
2|Have you seen Nadeko-chan?
2|I only know what I know...
2|No luck...
2|Ah yes, I remember, the Ponytail Sisters.
2|But we stopped right away, I wonder why?
2|Yeah, it lasted only a day, why was that?
2|Because of your messy bed hair, you couldn't even get a decent ponytail.

2|Sent off to commentaries again...?
3|-Thank you very much for your purchase of the first volume of Monogatari Series Second Season's last chapter, Koimonogatari!
3|-Did you enjoy it?
3|-Then, let us start with our usual audio commentary.
3|-My name is Hanekawa Tsubasa, third year at Naoetsu High School, and I am in charge of the first episode.
3|-My name is Oshino Ougi, first year at Naoetsu High School, and I am in charge of the first episode.
3|-It may be for a mere thirty minutes but I'll be in your care.
3|-Well, then...
3|-...Let's start right away...!
3|-Ehm...
3|-Let us start with what's on the screen...
3|-Kaiki-san is...
3|-In Nisemonogatari, during summer vacation, this man perpetrated...
3|Ehm... Excuse me, Ougi-chan, could you please be quiet for a second?
3|As a newcomer you might not be aware of this,
3|but it is now a fundamental common practice for me to be leading the commentaries, you know?
3|Oh my, please forgive me.
3|A new recruit like me being this impudent towards a veteran.
3|It's just, you see, by pretending to dislike being called the Commentary Heroine,
3|you are gaining a lot of popularity, right?
3|So, given that, I ended up thinking that maybe it was okay for me to take the lead.
3|Don't say pretending to dislike...
3|I'm sorry... Even knowing that I would be a much better lead,
3|I shouldn't have intruded like that.
3|Then, please, go on.
3|Continue the introduction with your patronizing attitude.
3|Do it for this poor newcomer.
3|Uhm... In fact I did start to get used to it.
3|Now I don't really dislike the nickname of Commentary Heroine anymore...
3|But, yes. Let's learn from what Kanbaru-san did one time and say this right away...
3|Ougi-chan,
3|I don't like you, I don't want to do this with you.
3|Oh, my. Hearing such a remark from a saint like Hanekawa-san,
3|Araragi-senpai will be disappointed!
3|Oops, I shouldn't be talking about Araragi-senpai with Hanekawa-senpai.
3|I apologize for rubbing Araragi on the open wounds of your broken heart.
3|It's coarse salt (arashio)...
3|I'm sorry, I stuttered.
3|That's what I don't like about you, do you understand?
3|Oh, there you go saying things like that when you actually love me so much!
3|Are you in Black Hanekawa mode?
3|Come on, say nya~n! Nya~n!
3|Black Hanekawa mode, you say...
3|It's not anything like that.
3|Don't say it like some kind of Tsundere mode.
3|Or rather, Could you not say anything in general?
3|For the next thirty minutes.
3|Aah, so harsh!
3|Is this what Senjougahara meant when she said:
3|"That girl from my class is kind to everyone but cold to herself", I wonder?
3|Wait a second.
3|Why do you know that stuff, Ougi-chan?
3|That scene wasn't animated!
3|I don't know anything~
3|Don't play dumb.
3|You know, I don't just let this things slip by.
3|I thoroughly point it out, you know?
3|I don't get fooled by vague but cool lines like that, you know?
3|If you say that, it's just like your
3|"I don't know everything. I just know what I know.",
3|isn't it?
3|Just an empty assertion that merely sounds meaningful.
3|Oops, I just went and said that...
3|I was supposed to make Hanekawa-senpai say it...
3|Now it's all ruined...
3|Ahh... I really screwed up!
3|Either you go home or I go home. Which is it?
3|Please, don't be so strict with me!
3|I'm still a new character that doesn't know left from right, after all.
3|I was just trying to be leave a good impression on Hanekawa-senpai as a cute hardworking kouhai.
3|I even brought a present!
3|Here.
3|TL Note: Grasshoppers boiled and preserved in soy sauce.
3|Ooh, wow! It's Inago no tsukunodani!
3|Your hardworking kouhai did her homework before coming here!
3|I listened to the Nekomonogatari commentary Hanekawa-senpai was rejected and...
3|Ahahah, did I say such a thing?
3|...didn't you talk about inago no tsukudani?
3|"Not even in Shinshuu people eat that anymore"
3|...you said.
3|So I decided to go investigate in Shinshuu and collected some evidence!
3|You really do some annoying things~
3|They sold them at the station, inago no tsukudani.
3|This is the receipt as evidence.
3|The way you do things is far too annoying...
3|Come on,
3|why don't you just apologize?
3|Publicly.
3|"This person with huge boobs and no sense of shame has made empty claims without knowing the circumstances,
3|but inago no tsukudani still boasts a well rooted popularity in the gastronomic culture of Shinshuu."
3|Like that.
3|Rather than doing annoying things... You're just an annoying person.
3|But just because they are sold at the station it doesn't mean they are popular among Shinshuu citizens, you know?
3|Aren't they aimed at tourists, if you had to say?
3|Oh my, I was counter-argued with sophistry.
3|Well, whatever.
3|I'll let you get away with that excuse.
3|Well then, go on and help yourself
3|Eh!?
3|Wasn't there a discussion like this in Nekomonogatari, where you were rejected?
3|That Hanekawa-senpai can eat anything, without any kind of preference?
3|So, help yourself.
3|Please eat this inago no tsukudani.
3|Ohoh, so that's what you were planning.
3|This development.
3|Oh my.
3|Oh my, oh my.
3|You won't eat it?
3|This present from you gallant kouhai?
3|Wow, how shocking!
3|So Hanekawa-senpai was this kind of person?
3|She refuses a present coming from one's heart!
3|She distances herself from people she's going to work with because of mere personal tastes!
3|They do exist, this kind of people.
3|I bet there are a lot among elites.
3|Well... This... I'll enjoy it later, okay?
3|Why are you trying to put it away?
3|Eh, could it be that you were trying to make your character more appealing?
3|You were acting out a character that can eat anything while you are actually really picky just to be more likeable?
3|Acting out... Be more likable... The way you say that...
3|This may be a trivial comment, but I never said I'd eat anything.
3|Aah, right. You don't care about flavoring.
3|You are a character that doesn't do any flavoring.
3|In other words you are the type that doesn't use any seasoning.
3|Ah... This was a blunder on my part, I apologize.
3|I'm glad you understand. I'm really glad!
3|In other word, you're saying you want to eat the grasshoppers without the soy sauce!
3|I did not say that! Hanekawa-senpai did not say that!
3|TL Note: Hornet/bee larvae.
3|This Is a digression, but in another store I also saw some hachinoko.
3|Japan really is big.
3|There are so many kinds of food.
3|Don't learn such a valuable lesson while harassing me...
3|Guess I'll at least open the package.
3|Woah, looking at them from up close they really are grasshoppers...
3|Well, well. Let's just say that talking about insects is a tradition of the commentaries.
3|It's not a tradition!
3|Thinking about it it was when I told Senjougahara about ants that this started...
3|But why does it have to end with me receiving inago no tsukudani?
3|There must be a limit to unexpectedness!
3|No, no. The punchline is that you end up EATING inago no tsukudani.
3|This talk won't end until you eat those grasshoppers.
3|The commentary will never comment what is on the screen if this goes on.
3|We only have thirty minutes this time.
3|And yet, because of Hanekawa-senpai,
3|because Hanekawa-senpai is wasting time,
3|It will end with just bugs talk.
3|TL Note: Unfinished = Shirikire tonbo, literally a dragonfly with its butt cut out.
3|It will be left unfinished with just bugs talk.
3|You went and made a pun.
3|Let's leave it at that...
3|No, let's not.
3|Understood.
3|I'll eat some too, so please join me.
3|Let's do fifty-fifty.
3|Why would you go that far just to harass me!?
3|Why are you vexating me!?
3|Because of my long life as a transfer student, my diet has always been full of regional food.
3|Ooh, here are some chopsticks the staff prepared for us.
3|Why is this starting to work like some variety show!?
3|Why did the staff make arrangements in advance!?
3|How can you have acquired underlings when this is only the second time you do a commentary out of three!?
3|Do you mind if we do jikabashi? I'm opening it.
3|TL Note: Taking food from a common plate/pot with one's own chopsticks instead of using a different apposite set. Bad manners in formal meals.
3|Well jikabashi is of course okay but...
3|Since this is supposed to be a present it's quite a lot.
3|When you say fifty-fifty, do you actually mean it!?
3|No, really it's not...
3|ALL AT ONCE!?
3|Thanks for the meal.
3|Well then, it's Hanekawa-senpai's turn.
3|You don't really get this cornered everyday...
3|Eh? Could it be that you won't do it?
3|You won't feast on the lives offered to you?
3|Not respecting food means not respecting living creatures!
3|Eeh... So Hanekawa-senpai is that kind of person~
3|How can you respect someone like that~?
3|There are grasshopper legs (ashi) coming out o the ends (ashi) of your mouth...
3|Oh, sorry. How embarrassing.
3|*Blush*
3|Don't "*blush*" me! That's not cute at all!
3|Itadakimasu.
3|Ooh, there she goes!
3|That's what I call eating.
3|You should chew thoroughly. This is some consideration from your kouhai.
3|Savor it to the end.
3|Thanks for the food! It was delicious!
3|As expected from you!
3|I hate that part of you!
3|Being hated for eating grasshoppers as I was said...
3|You better remember this.
3|"You better remember this"? That's not how you usually speak, Hanekawa senpai!
3|TL Note: Lose one's head = Awa wo kuu (Eating bubbles)
3|I'll make you lose your composure...
3|Isn't the one eating bubbles Senjougahara-senpai's crab?
3|Meanwhile, the time has ripened for the conversation between Senjougahara-senpai and the con man to begin.
3|Wait! don't just go on as if nothing happened.
3|Leave some spotlight for the Commentary Heroine you forced to eat grasshoppers!
3|This may be the first time Hanekawa-senpai has been so self-assertive.
3|I can wait for you if that's what you ask.
3|It's not like I'm feeling too good myself.
3|I'd be thankful if we could take a break too, actually.
3|So you were pushing yourself too!
3|Now that you mention it your pale skin is turning blue!
3|You're turning dark purple! What was that about being used to regional dishes!?
3|No, well, the grasshoppers were quite delicious... But the quantity...
3|Well, even if they weren't grasshoppers, you wouldn't eat this much tsukudani by itself...
3|Grasshoppers are jumping around in my stomach.
3|Don say something so scary! They're in my stomach too!
3|Well then, let's this time it is my win.
3|I think it's a tie though...
3|-So, I would like to start...
3|-I'd like to start talking about the main story, Koimonogatari...
3|-Hitagi End, which starts with this episode, is the closing chapter of Monogatari Series Second Season.
3|-The main character Is Senjougahara-san
3|-The main character Is Senjougahara-senpai.
3|-and it is the chronological sequel to Otorimonogatari.
3|You really never stop halfway even if I start talking too.
3|I will never let you have any job, no matter how hard...
3|You sure are harsh~
3|I can't believe this is the same person who let Senjougahara-senpai have Araragi-senpai~
3|The one saying harsh things is you.
3|-You.
3|You wouldn't normally say stuff like that, would you?
3|I didn't let her have him...
3|That's right! You were simply rejected!
3|Let's take this outside.
3|Man, being hated by a good person is exciting!
3|Well, it's not like it is possible to be nice to everyone in the real world.
3|I guess it's normal to change one's behavior depending on the people you interct with.
3|Yes, it's fine, Hanekawa-senpai.
3|You don't have to hide the real you in front of me.
3|Don't talk like the one in front of you is the real me...
3|Say how you really feel only to me!
3|What character is that?
3|It's one of the abusive-type characters you like.
3|Don't make me look like I like abusive characters.
3|There's no such information going around.
3|Eh? Then you dislike them?
3|Well, it's not what I call ethical if I have to say...
3|So you also hate girls who like them, like Kanbaru-senpai.
3|I never said that! Stop this, don't try to ruin our relationship...
3|You should never forget that when you say that you hate something you also deny everyone who likes it.
3|The A-part is over~
3|Oh no!
3|The B-part is starting!
3|Don't try to make up for your defeat.
3|There are not that many war records between us as commentary leads.
3|Is that so?
3|From he fact that during your first appearance in Onimonogatari you performed a flawless conduction,
3|I was starting to suspect that was already some kind of harassment directed at me.
3|Now that's some prejudice!
3|That was really a form of harassment, though.
3|Aren't my suspicions well placed, then!?
3|No, no, there's more.
3|It wasn't a personal attack directed at you,
3|I was harassing you veterans as a whole.
3|My plan was that if a newcomer like me was to do the job without a hitch,
3|it would be harder for my senpai to keep doing their jobs as if nothing happened.
3|You... Don't you think you hate us a bit too much?
3|Not at all, I am a big fan of the Araragi Harem!
3|Araragi Harem is not an official name!
3|You know, I was rejected after the examination, after all... For the Araragi Harem...
3|You were rejected?
3|I heard Ononoki-chan managed to enter, though.
3|The examination is though, you know?
3|I hear even Gaen-san and Kagenui-san didn't make it.
3|I don't think those two were trying to enter to begin with...
3|I guess they didn't,
3|unlike you, that is.
3|I never tried-
3|I mean, I did! I know I did, but that's different!
3|So this may be a nice opportunity to hear the opinion of a pioneer.
3|I'd like to hear some inside info from Hanekawa-senpai, who retired from the Araragi Harem.
3|Why couldn't I get in?
3|Your personality...
3|Aah, I guess that may be the case. You were also chased away because of your personality, after all.
3|You really are annoying...
3|Ah, I'll say this in advance.
3|The commentary for the second episode of Koimonogatari
3|will be presented to you by this annoying person, Oshino Ougi, and another annoying person, Araragi Tsukihi.
3|I really can't wait to see what kind of commentary it will turn out to be~
3|Please, don't drag Tsukihi-chan into this by labeling her as annoying.
3|That said, even I can't help but look up to Tsukihi-chan as annoying person.
3|Please, don't look up to her.
3|Still... I'm really worried about that commentary...
3|Oh, now. Let's worry about the main story for now.
3|Summing it up, On the screen you can see Senjougahara-senpai trying to hire Kaiki Deishuu in order to deceive Sengoku Nadeko-chan.
3|Speaking of which, Sengoku Nadeko-chan was also a member of the Araragi Harem.
3|It looks like she left left, like Hanekawa-senpai,
3|But you could say she was actually chased away.
3|I think you actually have something to do with that, you know?
3|Oh, really~?
3|I don't know anything~
3|Don't you at least know what you know?
3|Well, Sengoku Nadeko-chan doesn't appear in the first episode,
3|so I' guess we'll have fun talking about her in the second episode with Tsukihi-chan.
3|I think you two would really have fun doing that...
3|So, for now let us talk about Senjougahara Hitagi-san!
3|I re~ally like her, you know?
3|That sounds like a lie...
3|I think you two never even met each other, did you?
3|We even never appeared on the same scene, I guess.
3|You guess right.
3|Oh, well. I did like the old Senjougahara-san more, though.
3|Do you really have to say that?
3|Senjougahara-san's "lively abusive language" era...
3|I guess this time there was the thing about her lover's life being in danger...
3|You could say she's fundamentally edgy.
3|Oops.
3|I shouldn't talk about Senjougahara-san's lover...
3|I'm sorry, Hanekawa-senpai, I didn't intend any harm.
3|Your intent was evil, though.
3|No, really. I'm truly sorry!
3|Here, I'll let you punch me.
3|Come on, I closed my eyes, see?
3|Here.
3|Don't "here" me! There's no way I'll hit you!
3|Stop trying to manipulate me!
3|Also, like that it looks like you're asking for a kiss.
3|Anyway, to tell the truth,
3|Senjougahara-senpai has really grown up to be a better person (round, maruku).
3|Just like the old german currency (Mark, maruku).
3|She was too edgy at the time, though.
3|She was edgy... Or rather, sharp at the edges...
3|She doesn't have that kind of atmosphere anymore, I guess.
3|She put a stapler inside Araragi-kun's mouth after all.
3|Not only she put it inside, she also closed it!
3|That's what you normally call a crime scene.
3|It's even scarier if you think that this happened before she knew about his vampiric condition.
3|Seeing how she went to meet Kaiki wearing gruncho glasses I'd say that time's mischievousness is not gone, though.
3|She also changing them.
3|Just like Kaiki's sunglasses and hawaiian shirt.
3|Thos two are getting along well no matter how you look at them.
3|Senjougahara-san would kill you if she heard that.
3|Even the new Senjougahara-san would kill you.
3|Alas, will I be stapled?
3|But I guess that's fine too.
3|That would mean Senjougahara-senpai lively character is coming back to life.
3|TL Note: Tojikko comes from tojiru, which means to close, referring to the stapler.
3|A tojikko, rather than a dojikko.
3|I'll gladly sacrifice myself for this cause!
3|You do look like the kind of person who would smile with a stapler in her mouth...
3|It may be pointless to say to those who have already watched Koimonogatari,
3|since this is a commentary let's explain
3|Senjougahara-senpai and Kaiki Deishuu-san... This two used to be a lovey-dovey couple!
3|In the end they broke up because of a small incomprehension.
3|But now, in this first episode, in order to solve her current's boyfriend's pinch she seeks the help of her old flame.
3|Wait right there! That was a misuse of words, a misunderstanding and above all malicious!
3|Eh? did I screw up again without noticing?
3|You're aware of everything. That was totally a premeditated crime.
3|Oh, so you plan to change subject bringing on "that's not what premeditated means" talk, huh?
3|I won't fall for that!
3|Let's go on talking about Senjougahara's womanhood.
3|Don't say it in such a crude way!
3|Anyway, "premeditated" still fits your case perfectly.
3|Well I guest what people do knowingly is what you call premeditated.
3|Well then, I'll explain properly.
3|Because of the condition afflicting her body during the first year of high school, Senjougahara-san
3|sought counseling from Kaiki Deishuu, a con artist who at the time was working as a Ghost Buster.
3|The details about what happened in that occasion are still shrouded in mystery,
3|but as a result Senjougahara-san's family ended up falling apart.
3|For that reason Senjougahara-san deeply resents Kaiki-san.
3|However, during the incident involving Sengoku-chan, since Araragi was now in a dangerous situation,
3|putting aside their past interactions she is asking for Kaiki-san's help.
3|This is what this first episode is about.
3|If you put the story in such a favorable manner, it only sounds more like a lie.
3|Uhm... That's what makes me think you're an unreasonable person.
3|Why don't you try saying clearly what or whom have I been unreasonable about, then?
3|If that is all there is to explain, there's no reason these two would get along so well, don't you think?
3|Can't you feel some kind of particular relationship from them?
3|If you can't feel it then that's what makes you...
3|I'm not unreasonable! This is not what makes me unreasonable!
3|There's not need to hide it, okay?
3|Even if Kaiki-san approached her with the only intent of deceiving her,
3|Senjougahara-san was way too easy for being seduced like that.
3|Don't call her easy!
3|The she was seduced?
3|She wasn't.
3|It's not like I know that much about them at that time,
3|but let's stop with your low-life assumptions. Okay, Ougi-chan?
3|Oh, I see. You just nonchalantly called me a low-life by using an idiom.
3|A commentary veteran's techniques really are on a different level.
3|Oh, wait. This person gets mad if she is called a commentary veteran.
3|My bad, my bad.
3|Even if you didn't I'd be mad at you.
3|I'd just be mad at you for being you.
3|Oh, my. I received a direct hit to my personality from a wholesome person like Hanekawa-senpai...
3|I can still deal with it since she's my senpai,
3|but i'd really hate to have such a person in the same class~
3|You just nonchalantly implied that Senjougahara-san and Araragi-kun who are in my class must hate me, didn't you?
3|You're the one whose technique is on a different level!
3|Look at us. Being at each other's throat because we read too much into what each other says.
3|Aah... It's okay, it's okay.
3|Don't worry, Araragi-senpai doesn't hate you at all!
3|In fact, he really likes you.
3|As a friend, that is.
3|Whit your personality you can't really complain if people criticize you!
3|I don't really want to be criticized about my personality by someone who has not two, but three of them...
3|Now I have only one!
3|I hate to admit it but the way you said that was really moe...
3|Putting jokes aside. It must have been mortifying for Senjougahara-san, painful even.
3|Asking Kaiki-san for help, that is.
3|That's the reason why there is a two-month blank between Otorimonogatari and Koimonogatari.
3|Onimonogatari was placed between them, though.
3|Er... That's because of how the show was scheduled to be put on air.
3|Well, as Hanekawa-senpai says, it was pretty lame.
3|Making such a big parting declaration during summer break,
3|going to the extent of snapping his phone,
3|and then being the one to contact him to meet up.
3|As Hanekawa-senpai says...
3|I never said that!
3|Stop exaggerating everything I say!
3|That's the one thing you must never do during a debate.
3|Well, you know. This is something I kind of knew from the get go,
3|but we really don't work as a team, do we?
3|Actually I heard from the staff that they started to feel like they did every possible thing with the cast for the commentaries.
3|So they decided to try something new by trying to send in two persons that actually hate each other,
3|rather than tho who only look like they do as they did with the Loli Duo.
3|I guess there was no need to even try.
3|I have to agree with you for the first time.
3|The fact that I didn't know anything about this situation you heard of from the staff gives me the chills...
3|I don't know everything! I only know what I know.
3|I really wanted to know this...
3|Then was the cast for the second episode also decided because you and Tsukihi-chan hate each other?
3|But since you never met there's no reason you should hate each other.
3|Exactly. That's the second phase of the test:
3|seeing what happens when you put together the characters with the most annoying personalities.
3|Please don't try... People with the most annoying personalities...
3|It's a fight to decide who is the most annoying.
3|While I obviously love Tsukihi-chan as a person,
3|If it comes to a fight I will have a chance so I'll do my best not to lose.
3|That's one unproductive fight...
3|And then, for the third match, the third episode's commentary will be between Tsukihi-chan and the girl who is on screen right now, Senjougahara-senpai.
3|This will be a match between people whose characters overlap.
3|Between people whose characters overlap... Someone did say that. Even Senjougahara-san did, but still...
3|They don't simply overlap, their flaws also overlap.
3|I can't wait!
3|I wonder... It will be three consecutive commentaries where the hosts can't work together...
3|That's really not how you find new ways to do things...
3|Are you sure you just heard this from the staff and didn't instigate them instead?
3|Not at all. I don't hold any authority here, unlike Producer Hachikuji.
3|In that case, I can even consider selling my body.
3|This scene really makes you shiver...
3|Even a person like me can only be shaken by this.
3|Whatever a person like you say ends up sounding like a lie, though.
3|Ahah, guess I'll never be a con artist.
3|I didn't mean to say that you are a poor liar,
3|I was just saying you can't be trusted.
3|Iiidiot!
3|Uh?
3|Uh? What?!
3|Iidiot, iiidiot, iiiiiidiot!
3|EH? What's that?! What act is this?!
3|Iidiot, iiidiot, iiiiiidiot!
3|Er... Wait a second Ougi-chan!
3|Oh, sorry. I was just wondering how woud Hanekawa-senpai react if faced with simple insults rather than a dialogue filled with ulterior meanings.
3|Simple insults you say...
3|I guess being able to do that is my strong point when dealing with Hanekawa-senpai.
3|It's pretty much my only strong point in general, though.
3|Unfortunately it was quite effective...
3|That hurt... What's this?
3|I feel like I may cry a little...
3|Good for you!
3|Being able to cry after having experienced what happened in Nekomonogatari.
3|It really is a good thing, but I didn't learn how to cry in order to be called an idiot by you!
3|Here we can see Kaiki-san doing a soliloquy in front of a mirror.
3|That's a really peculiar way to meditate on things.
3|I guess everyone has their own way.
3|It is indeed not common to do it in front of a mirror.
3|But I guess it is normal to have a conversation with oneself in order to deepen one's understanding.
3|Oh, so you finally think the time is ripe for a commentary hosted by Hanekawa Tsubasa and Black Hanekawa in the second volume!
3|Let's just say I would have certainly preferred it to one with Hanekawa Tsubasa and Oshino Ougi.
3|Waah... Hearing something like that really makes me cry! Waaa! Waaa!
3|That's the first time I hear a better monotone than Ononoki-chan's...
3|Ononoki-chan!
3|That girl really stirred up Second Season too!
3|Uhm.. I guess the B-part is going to end any moment now.
3|It's kind of a pity that this has to end with only thirty minutes...
3|I have no regrets.
3|After these thirty minutes are over and everything's finished I'll just say
3|"Thanks for the hard work!" and go home right away.
3|I'll go straight home.
3|The expression "straight home" has nothing to do with time, though.
3|It's the right expression because I won't come back here.
3|I guess you have no intention of walking home with me~
3|Let's go drink something!
3|Let's do some girls talk and love talk!
3|There's no way I'd do any of that with you!
3|And that's because I hate you!
3|I'm glad for you! You have learned how to hate people!
3|It's indeed a good thing I can now hate people,
3|but haveing a person I hate in front of me is certainly not.
3|There you go, saying things like that again, when you actually love me so much!
3|Saying I actually like you after being blatantly told that I hate you...
3|That's not even a tsundere, it's just a girl whose personality has fallen apart!
3|I guess we could say that what really is tsundere is Kaiki-san's behavior right now.
3|By ussing Kanbaru as a convenient excuse,
3|he ended up fabricating a motive to help Senjougahara-senpai for himself.
3|Uhm... Since it's about another person's mentality I don't really want to say anything,
3|but this really looks like a hard way to live.
3|Not being able to act unless you can make up an excuse for yourself.
3|I guess that's the polar opposites of types like Araragi who act by reflex without a second thought.
3|now that you say that, Kaiki-san and Araragi-kun really are polar opposites.
3|I guess that's why they can't get along.
3|I don't think that's just a coincidence.
3|Senjougahara simply chose someone of opposite character as her new boyfriend after having learned her lesson with Kaiki-san.
3|Don't make it sound like there was an old one...
3|-B...
3|-B-part is now over!
3|Ah, she saw through me.
3|-Here is the ending theme!
3|-The new, third ending theme for Monogatari Series Second Season is Haruna Runa-san and Kawano Marina-san's "Snow drop"!
3|I don't think this is a " the first who says it wins" thing...
3|At this point it's just stubbornness
3|The first episode ended with just Senjougahara-san and Kaiki-san's conversation.
3|It sure is.
3|It ended with just Senjougahara-san and Kaiki-san's date.
3|Don't "it sure is" me! Don't try to gradually demolish well-established facts!
3|You're not some classmate who wants to turn every pair of friends into a couple!
3|This happened a long time ago but, in that park,
3|didn't you also have fun trying to make Araragi-senpai and Senjougahara-senpai into a couple like this?
3|You're really weird.
3|I really think that even if you didn't do anything special, if you just acted normally, you and Araragi-senpai would be going out now.
3|That's exa~ctly, what I cou~ldn't do, so there's nothing to do~
3|You're so cute after all.
3|It's fine, I've come to terms with it.
3|Araragi-kun properly rejected me.
3|"it's fine even if I couldn't become the person the one I really love loves"
3|TL Note: Referring to the song's lyrics.
3|You're not rubbing salt on my wounds... You're making new ones...
3|It's alright!
3|Even if Araragi-senpai doesn't really love you...
3|I really love you, Hanekawa-senpai.
3|TL Note: They're still mimicking the lyrics.
3|Even if by chance I was the person Ougi-chan really loves,
3|for the me that you really love, you're still someone I really hate!
3|Aaha, I managed to become the person the one I really hate really hates!
3|You hate me after all!
3|it's a miracle I can truly believe.
3|It's just your everyday necessity.
3|-The ending...
3|-Is now over!
3|-And
3|-here
3|-is
3|-the
3|-next
3|-episode preview!
3|Ooh! This is the kind of thing you can't do if you get along!
3|Ougi-chan... You said two words at the end...
3|Don't be so stingy now... your composure sure is small compared to your boobs...
3|What did you saaay?!
3|No way... is this the end of the commentaries for me?!
3|Exactly, you can go straight home now.
3|No! I'm applying for the second volume!
3|I'll participate to the commentaries voluntarily for the first time!
3|I'll never let everything go according to your plans!
3|The way you said that is really cute, that's unfair.
3|I hate that part of you too.
3|Hate me as much as you like!
3|Then I guess I'll leave the closure to you.
3|Well then...
3|The host for the first episode of the first volume of Koimonogatari, Hitagi End, was
3|"I hope something good happens!"
3|Oshino Ougi!
3|Don't steal my whole line!
3|"I hope something good happens""
3|Hanekawa Tsubasa!
3|I'll also take part to the second episode.
3|We'll DEFINITELY meet again in the second volume!

4|Are you crazy?
4|I am not.
4|Give me that hundred thousand you said you could pay.
4|Very well.
4|This will do.
4|No, that's only an advance payment—
4|I said this would do.
4|You wouldn't even be able to sell yourself into prostitution to pay the amount I'd normally demand.
4|Doesn't matter how hard you work yourself.
4|I'm only taking this hundred thousand to cover for necessary expenses, too.
4|But that's...
4|That's...
4|It's justified caution.

4|Are you sure there are seventy-four days left?
4|Yes.
4|Naoetsu High School's graduation ceremony will be held on the Ides of March.
4|That afternoon, after the ceremony draws to a close,
4|we won't have the time to celebrate.
4|Araragi, Oshino Shinobu, and I will be killed immediately.
4|Is that for certain?
4|Is it set in stone?
4|Can't that god lose her cool and kill you right this very moment, for example?
4|I don't think so.
4|Why not?
4|You, and probably Araragi as well,
4|are talking to me and doing who knows what else in a bid to save your skins, aren't you?
4|I bet the god wouldn't be too pleased to hear that.
4|There's no way you can say for sure that she won't get mad and decide to have you killed before the promised time.
4|Just because she's a god, it doesn't mean she keeps her promise for sure.
4|Scene no. 59
4|No, I can.
4|I certainly can.
4|I mean, Sengoku Nadeko's already as mad as she could possibly be.
4|And yet, Araragi and I are still alive.
4|That means she intends to keep her word.
4|How on earth did you—the two of you— incur this Sengoku Nadeko's wrath?
4|What did you even do to get on the verge of being killed?
4|Actually...
4|I don't know myself.
4|Come on, there's no way you wouldn't know.
4|I really don't.
4|Well, of course there are causes, mistakes, disagreements, misunderstandings, and blunders at play,
4|but I don't know if that's enough to turn things into what they are now.
4|Or well, I think there's something else behind all this—
4|something completely contrary to the understanding Araragi and I have.
4|Though I'm just repeating what Hanekawa said.
4|Hanekawa again?
4|Still, I'll go ahead and say this so as to give you some sort of idea:
4|Think of it as love issues.
4|Sengoku Nadeko was in love with Araragi since before she became a god.
4|Welcome to Okinawa! Welcome to Okinawa! Welcome to Okinawa! Welcome to Okinawa!
4|First dip First dip First dip First dip
4|First time First time First time First time
4|But he had a girlfriend.
4|Something like that.
4|How petty.
4|Well, whatever.
4|That's all I needed to know.
4|Anyway, can I consider this case to be an exception?
4|What do you mean?
4|Oh, come on.
4|I'm asking if I'm allowed in your town.
4|Of course you are.
4|Think of this case as an exception—or well, special circumstances—and feel free to act as you wish.
4|Be careful, though.
4|There are plenty of people who hold grudges against you.
4|Make sure you're not beaten to death by middle schoolers and found lying somewhere as an unidentified corpse.
4|This girl says scary stuff.
4|Scene no. 85
4|Getting warned like this
4|makes me want to stay away.
4|And this goes without saying, but don't let Araragi find you either.
4|Okay.
4|I don't want to meet him either.
4|All right, then.
4|I'll start looking into things today.
4|That said, Senjougahara,
4|don't expect this case to be solved in just a day or two.
4|Okay.
4|I'm resigned to the fact that this will be a long-term battle.
4|Actually, it already is one.
4|However, I will stay in touch frequently.
4|It's a bit weird to say this after making a job request,
4|but it's impossible for me to fully trust you.
4|That's fine.
4|Have suspicions, not faith.
4|Check-in
4|So I'll be flying to your town today,
4|but I should probably take a different flight than you.
4|Buy a Ryuukyuu Beauty as your souvenir!

4|It would be a serious problem if Araragi were to find out we flew together.
4|That's right.
4|By the way, Kaiki...

4|Um, could you lend me some money for the flight home?

4|In which case, I'll have to go after the other enemy headquarters first.
4|Though it seems strange to me that there's more than one headquarters.
4|Anyway, the second one I'm talking about is Sengoku Nadeko's home.
4|What?
4|Have you made some progress?
4|I've finished my preparations.
4|I'll start now.
4|I'm hearing a lot of background noise.
4|Where are you, anyway?
4|Araragi's place.
4|Senjougahara replied.
4|Scene no. 150
4|Though she didn't have to.
4|I got invited over.
4|My dad's here too.
4|Well, I guess it's like family bonding or something.
4|How nice.
4|Don't say it like that.

4|I want Sengoku Nadeko's address.
4|Text it to me.
4|Scene no. 185
4|Sengoku Residence
4|Scene no. 185
4|I said I was—in other words, I pretended to be— the father of one of Sengoku Nadeko's classmates
4|Sengoku
4|and got into the Sengoku residence that way.
4|"My daughter also went missing three days ago."
4|"I think she said something about your daughter right before it happened."
4|"It's been eating away at me, which is why I came here against my better judgment."
4|"Could you tell me a bit about your daughter?"
4|Et cetera.
4|Once I mentioned their daughter Nadeko by name,
4|they completely dropped their guard against their unknown visitor.
4|But Mr. and Mrs. Sengoku knew nothing— not a single thing—about their daughter.
4|I think they said something about how she was shy, timid, and always had a smile on her face.
4|I didn't come here to listen to them brag, though. I wanted to know about the darkness she held within herself.
4|But it didn't seem like they knew or even wanted to know, for that matter.
4|So I asked them, "Do you mind if I take a look at her room?"
4|"There should some things my daughter lent yours in there which could prove useful in our search for them."
4|"Would you happen to know anything of the sort?"
4|Starting from there, it took me a long detour of about thirty minutes before I finally reached my goal.
4|Nadeko's room
4|Scene no. 240
4|The room actually made me feel like it was shoving a childish and cute impression into my face.
4|Adding to that the fact that Sengoku Nadeko's father said earlier that she never went through a rebellious phase,
4|I had my misgivings about the whole thing.
4|This might be the key to solving this case.
4|The darkness Sengoku Nadeko held.
4|I asked for her parents' permission, then...
4|Scene no. 216
4|Oh, so this is her.
4|Cute, childish, and creepy.
4|She seemed artificial.
4|I thought it was almost like she was forced to act pretty.
4|She's got a smile on her face, but it's a stiff one.
4|She's trying to use her bangs as a shield against eye contact—
4|or well, it even looks like she's cowering in fright.
4|What is she so afraid of?
4|What is it?
4|All of these pictures show her by herself.
4|Didn't she take any with my daughter?
4|Uh, please don't touch that closet.
4|Turns out that Sengoku Nadeko had told them not to.
4|It'd be extremely difficult to explain how I feel right now.
4|So I'll just lay down the facts.
4|Even though their daughter had disappeared,
4|Sengoku Nadeko's parents were fixated on keeping her room clean and in its usual state.
4|Even though there might've been an important clue inside,
4|they did exactly as their daughter ordered and never opened her closet.

4|What? You don't even know what she looks like?
4|I've never met her, you see.
4|You say she was an indirect victim of mine, but that's just you.
4|Come to think of it, I have no way of telling if it's true.
4|Are you trying to say I'm lying to you?
4|I bet you wouldn't want to hear that from me
4|Scene no. 254
4|I took a look at a photo album at her place.
4|Cute kid, isn't she?

4|You knew her address.
4|Does that mean you've visited the Sengoku residence?
4|Yes, I have.
4|One of Araragi's sisters is a good friend of hers.
4|I used that connection.
4|Does Araragi's sister know about the situation he finds himself in?
4|Neither of them know.
4|The only ones who do are me, Araragi, Oshino Shinobu, and Hanekawa.
4|I actually wanted to keep it a secret from Hanekawa too,
4|but she found out.
4|Seriously, what is with this Hanekawa?
4|Anyway, I got a glimpse of Sengoku Nadeko's family circumstances,
4|but Senjougahara, how do you actually feel about her?
4|Think of it as a topic of idle talk rather than a request for information.
4|You said she was the type of girl you hate, but I'd like to hear some more "anecdotes" mixed in.
4|Hey, what's wrong?
4|Well, the thing is, I've never met Sengoku Nadeko myself.
4|What? Really?
4|Yes.
4|I spoke to her on the phone once to strike a deal with her, but that was when she was no longer human.
4|That so? I'm starting to see the whole picture now.
4|Of this incomprehensible situation you find yourself in, I mean.
4|Stop
4|I'm amazed you're still of sound mind.
4|I guess.
4|Though well, you came to me for help,
4|so maybe you have lost your mind already.
4|Kaiki, look...
4|Anyway, I think I'm going to go meet Sengoku Nadeko.
4|I can see her at to the Shrine of the Polar Snake, right?
4|I can't say for sure.
4|Araragi gets to see her maybe once in five tries.
4|And each time, he comes back after nearly getting killed.
4|She can kill him at any time, but it looks like she's letting him live until the promised day.
4|He won't be coming today, will he?
4|I really don't want to run into him at the shrine.
4|He won't. He's going to spend the night with me—
4|Never mind.
4|I don't mind if I don't get to see her.
4|It's just that I can't do anything unless I take a look at the place.
4|What if you do meet her?
4|Do you have enough material to deceive her already?
4|Not at all.
4|But I'd like to see how she's doing, or well, just make her acquaintance.
4|Not to mention, this whole thing might get resolved by just talking to her.
4|Okay.
4|I think that's impossible, but do your best.

4|She must be happy.
4|Thanks, mister!
4|You're my first believer, huh, old man?
4|Stop calling me an old man.
4|My name's Kaiki Deishuu.
4|I'd just made a huge mistake.
4|Sengoku Nadeko was an indirect victim of the scam I'd carried out in this town.
4|Then it wouldn't be out of the question for her to have heard of me from someone—
4|Araragi or the Fire Sisters, perhaps.
4|That's what I thought, but...
4|Kaiki!
4|Kaiki Deishuu!
4|That's a weird name.
4|Nice to meet you.
4|Sorry I called you an old man.
4|Yeah, now that I take a close look, you're actually quite young!
4|So young! I even thought for a second that you were younger than me!
4|I'm gonna call you "young master!"
4|She must've heard of me.
4|But she doesn't remember it anymore.
4|This girl has forgotten all about the root of evil that drove her into this corner.
4|That's the conclusion I reached.
4|She easily forgets things that are impossible to forget.
4|In return, she remembers things that don't matter.
4|For example, she never forgets the fact that her friend's brother was nice to her back when she was a kid.
4|In other words, she's got her priorities all mixed up.
4|I realized that.
4|You see, I'm waiting for March with bated breath!
4|Should I tell you?
4|Can I?
4|When March comes, I can murder the person I love!
4|I was asked to wait half a year, so I'm doing just that.
4|I'm a god, so I have to answer my subject's prayers.
4|Lately I've been starting to feel like I can't hold out,
4|but I'll endure!
4|A god has to keep her promises!
4|10000
4|Fake Bank

4|That's right.
4|It's very important to keep your promises.
4|You could even call it a divine act.
4|I play along with her by saying things I don't mean.
4|I found her so pitiful I was unable to shoot her down.
4|You're free to believe that.
4|A visitor, or "devotee," has her on cloud nine.
4|She's trying to entertain her guest by talking about something fun.
4|A god that's almost like a middle schooler.
4|I found her utterly ridiculous and pathetic.
4|I couldn't help but pity her.
4|I don't get it, though.
4|Why doesn't anybody visit this shrine?
4|It's, like, brand new now.
4|I thought a bunch of people would come.
4|Maybe there's not enough publicity.
4|Or maybe there's not enough of a service being offered.
4|Service? You mean fanservice?
4|I ignored that.

4|I can't tell if that's his first or last name.

4|don't you think that's better than having it requited, Kaiki?

4|I don't get it, so I chase him away.
4|I tell him to come back in March because that's when I'm going to kill him.
4|Though lately I've been pretending to be away because he's so persistent.
4|Does nobody else really visit?
4|Have Koyomi and I really been the only ones to come here until now?
4|A few people did visit at the start,
4|but they ran away once I showed up.
4|I don't know why.
4|You're the first person to make an offering without running away.
4|So thank you!

4|People have only ever called me cute.
4|To her, being called cute is neither a compliment nor does it make her happy.
4|In fact, I'm sure that word has placed a lot of restrictions on her.
4|That is why insults actually bring her great joy instead.
4|Yeah.
4|In that case, she is better off staying a god instead of turning back into a human.
4|That made me a little reluctant,
4|but then I realized that it had nothing to do with me.
4|Oh, so I'm creepy and too scary!
4|Then, would their perception of me change if I tied my snake hair up with a scrunchie?
4|It's starting to get late, so I'll be leaving now.
4|What? Let's chat some more!
4|Don't leave, Kaiki!
4|I'd feel so sad!
4|Play with this if you're bored.
4|What's this? Cat's cradle?
4|Oh, you know about it?
4|Yep. Nobita loved to play, right?
4|Cat's cradle, dozing off, and quick draws are his specialties!
4|It gives people a peace of mind knowing how eternal Doraemon is.

4|I'm your first believer, after all.
4|I'm sure
4|that even if all my wishes were to come true
4|I'd come to desire something else
4|and come to regret it in turn
4|My love and the time I lacked
4|will be my path into the future
4|There's someone I love
4|There's someone I love,
4|and we haven't even managed to accept the fact
4|that this has become normal for us
4|We feel so irritated,
4|but today we grew a little more confident again,
4|so that tomorrow we can laugh
4|and say that we are happy

5|Take what?
5|Your request. What else is there?
5|Deceiving a god? I'll take a shot at it.
5|Are you sane?
5|I am sane.
5|For now, give me the 100,000 yen that you said you could pay immediately.
5|All right. This will be good enough.
5|No, that's only a down payment. What you might call earnest money...
5|I'm telling you, this will be good enough.
5|If I invoiced you for what I really feel is fitting for the job...
5|...you selling yourself wouldn't be enough.
5|No matter how harsh the work, it wouldn't be enough.
5|I only accepted this 100,000 yen to pay for necessary expenses.
5|But, that's... That's....
5|If I end up not using all of the money and have some left over, I won't be that nit-picky.
5|I'll gladly accept the change.
5|That is the only condition with which I'll take this job.

5|Then, let me get into the details.
5|Are you sure that you only have 74 days left?
5|Yes. The graduation ceremony for Naoetsu High is on March 15th.
5|That afternoon, in other words, after the graduation ceremony...
5|...without being able to finish my school days with a party...
5|...myself, Araragi-kun, and Oshino Shinobu are going to be killed.
5|Is that absolute? Are you absolutely sure?
5|For instance, can this god lose her temper and kill you today? At this moment?
5|No, I don't think so.
5|Why?
5|To put this directly, you, and probably Araragi as well, are planning...
5|...a way for you guys to stay alive, whether it be consulting me or something else, right?
5|That should be an act that hideously ruins this god's impression of you.
5|You can't just deny the possibility
5|that she'll get mad and get rid of you guys earlier than the deadline.
5|I can deny it.
5|I can deny it. Because Nadeko is as angry as she can ever be at this point.
5|Yet, Araragi-kun and I are still alive.
5|Which means she intends on keeping her promise.
5|You... You guys... What kind of grudge did you buy from this Sengoku Nadeko?
5|What in the world did you do to put you at risk of getting killed?
5|That's...
5|...something I don't know.
5|Come on, there's no way you don't know!
5|But I really don't know.
5|No, of course... How do you put it...
5|There are things like a cause, an error, a disagreement, a misunderstanding, a mistake...
5|But that's all, and I really don't know why things ended up the way they did.
5|I feel like there's another side to this that's vastly different from how Araragi-kun and I see this.
5|Though, I'm just believing what Hanekawa-san said.
5|This Hanekawa again?
5|But for now, I'll say whatever needs to be said as a starter. Just regard this...
5|...as a romantic entanglement gone wrong.
5|Welcome to Okinawa! Welcome to Okinawa! Welcome to Okinawa! Welcome to Okinawa!
5|Before she became a god, Nadeko was in love with Araragi-kun, but he had a girlfriend...
5|First dip First dip First dip First dip
5|First time First time First time First time
5|That kind of thing.
5|It's that lowbrow a tale?
5|Well, all right. I think hearing that much should be enough.
5|But, I'm assuming that this case is an exception?
5|Exception to what?
5|I mean, it's all right for me to go back to your town.
5|Of course. That's a given.
5|This case is an exception, or rather, something special, so do as you please.
5|But be careful.
5|There are people out there that hold a grudge against you.
5|Please make sure that you don't...
5|...get beaten to a pulp by a junior high kid, only to be left as an unidentifiable corpse.
5|And this is a given, but please make sure Araragi-kun doesn't see you either.
5|Hmph... Fair enough. Well, I don't want to see him either.
5|All right.
5|I'll start the investigation today, immediately.
5|That said, Senjougahara, don't think that this will be solved in a day or two.
5|Yes. I'm prepared for this to be a long fight. Or rather, it's already a long fight to begin with.
5|But I'm going to contact you often.
5|This feels strange after requesting services from you,
5|but it's impossible for me to completely trust you.
5|That's how it should be.
5|Don't trust. Doubt.

5|But going there as the very first location is past reckless and outright foolish.
5|Which means the other central location should be visited first.
5|It feels weird that there are multiple locations...
5|...to be tagged as central locations, but the other central location is Sengoku Nadeko's house.
5|What is it? Are there new developments or something?
5|I've just finished my preparations. I'm going to start acting now.
5|It seems pretty rowdy behind you. Where are you this early in the year?
5|Araragi-kun's house.
5|I got an invitation over. My father's here too.
5|Well, so it's like our families get along with each other.
5|How heartwarming.
5|Long life
5|Don't put it that way.
5|I already know how easygoing and comical all of what we are doing sounds...
5|I want to know Sengoku Nadeko's address. Text it to me.
5|I posed as the father of one of Sengoku Nadeko's classmates...
5|Sengoku
5|...in other words, I deceived my way into the Sengoku household.
5|"My daughter has been missing for the last three days as well."
5|"I think she mentioned something about your daughter right before she disappeared."
5|"That's been on my mind, so I'm here, knowing that it's pretty thoughtless of me."
5|"Would you like to tell me a few things about your daughter?" And so on.
5|As soon as I said their daughter's name "Nadeko-san"...
5|...the parents completely dropped all alarm at the strange visitor.
5|However, the Sengoku couple knew not of their daughter. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
5|Someone afraid of strangers. A well-behaved girl. A girl that laughed a lot.
5|I think they were talking about things like that.
5|But, what I wanted to know weren't such words of a loving parent...
5|...but the shadows she harbored in her heart.
5|They didn't seem know of such a thing, and furthermore, didn't want to ever find out about it.
5|And so I asked them, "Would it be all right if I could take a look at her room?"
5|I started with "I believe my daughter lent something to Nadeko-san...
5|...and that may be a clue to finding their whereabouts. Would you have any ideas?"
5|Then I beat around the bush for 30 minutes or so and finally arrived at that goal.
5|I thought, if anything...
5|...the room was one where immaturity and cuteness were being forced against her will.
5|Combine that with how Nadeko's father said something about her never rebelling against him...
5|...and there are a few thoughts that I get.
5|Perhaps this is near where the key lies.
5|To the darkness in Nadeko's heart.
5|I see. So this is Sengoku Nadeko.
5|Childish, cute, and disgusting.
5|She seemed like a fake.
5|It seemed like she was forced to be pretty.
5|She was smiling, but it was somehow awkward.
5|She grows her bangs down and tries to not make eye contact, or rather...
5|...expounding on that, it seems like she's nervous about something.
5|What exactly does she fear? What is she afraid of?
5|All of the photos are just of her.
5|I wonder if she never took photos with my daughter.
5|Oh, please don't touch that closet.
5|I asked, and as expected, she was told by Sengoku Nadeko to stay away.
5|It's difficult to describe the emotions I had at this time, so I'll just state the facts.
5|In other words, Sengoku Nadeko's parents, despite the fact that their daughter was missing...
5|...kept her room clean and were infatuated only with keeping it the way it was.
5|And despite the fact that an important clue may be lying within...
5|...they are doing as they were told by their daughter,
5|and didn't even think about opening the closet.
5|Send me a photo of Sengoku Nadeko.
5|What, you don't even know what she looks like?
5|It's a girl I've never met.
5|You're the one telling me that she's an indirect victim of my doings.
5|After much thought, that may or may not be true.
5|Are you telling me you think I'm deceiving you?
5|I flipped through a photo album at Sengoku Nadeko's house. She's a cute girl.
5|One you probably despise.
5|No vehicles
5|You're right.
5|30
5|I hate her type the most.
5|Naoetsu elevated bridge 1
5|Even if this wasn't how we met, I could never be friends with those types.

5|Please take another route during the construction
5|Since you knew her address, have you visited the Sengoku house before?
5|Of course I have.
5|One of Araragi-kun's younger sisters was a good friend of Sengoku Nadeko.
5|So I managed to go.
5|Araragi's younger sister knows of this?
5|The condition her big brother is in right now?
5|Those girls don't know.
5|The only people that know are myself, Araragi-kun, Oshino Shinobu, and Hanekawa-san.
5|I really wanted to keep it a secret from Hanekawa-san as well, but she figured it out.
5|I'm asking you, who is this Hanekawa?
5|Anyway, with this I was able to get a glimpse of Sengoku Nadeko's family circumstances.
5|Senjougahara, in all honesty, what did you think of Sengoku Nadeko?
5|Don't think of this as providing information, but more of an informal chat.
5|You mentioned earlier you don't like that type of girl... How to put it...
5|I want to hear what you think, and an experience you've had with her.
5|Hmm? What's wrong?
5|Actually... I've never met Sengoku Nadeko directly in person.
5|What? Is that so?
5|Yes. We only made one deal over the phone. We had that one conversation.
5|Even that was after she stopped being a human too.
5|I see. I'm starting to get a grasp of it.
5|This incomprehensible situation that you are facing...
5|Stop
5|I'm surprised you can stay sane through it.
5|Right.
5|Well, since you're coming to me for help, I wouldn't be surprised if you've already lost your sanity.
5|Kaiki, I'm telling you, I...
5|In any case, I'm planning on going to meet Sengoku Nadeko right now.
5|I can meet her at North Shirahebi Shrine, right?
5|You're not guaranteed to see her.
5|Araragi-kun said he sees her about once every five visits...
5|...and each time he sees her, he comes home nearly dead.
5|Seems like she can kill him at any time, but is graciously letting him live until the promised day.
5|Araragi isn't heading over today, is he?
5|I don't want to bump into him inside the shrine grounds.
5|He won't be going. Because tonight he's with me... No, wait...
5|Well, if I don't see her, I don't see her. That's fine.
5|But I can't begin if I don't see what this place looks like.
5|What will you do if you're able to see her?
5|Do you already have enough to deceive her?
5|Not at all.
5|It's merely to visit and see how she's doing. To put a name to the face...
5|Besides, this may unexpectedly resolve itself with a good discussion.
5|I see. I think that's an impossibility, but do your best.
5|Purity in Spirit
5|Wash your heart and body before visiting the gods
5|How to wash your hands
5|1. put a ladle of water on your left hand
5|2. next on your right hand
5|3. hold a little water in your left hand, and rinse your mouth. Cover your mouth with your hand when you spit it out
5|4. wash your left hand again, since it touched your mouth
5|5. finally wash the ladle's handle with the water left
5|This way the next person can do the same easily.
5|Care for each other!
5|Here's Nadeko!
5|I took the time to become a god...
5|...but nobody came up here for their New Year's visit, so it's been boring!
5|Old man, can you be my conversation partner?
5|Ten thousand yen! Ten thousand yen!
5|Thank you, old man!
5|Old man, you're my very first adherent!
5|Stop calling me old man. My name is Kaiki Deishu.
5|Thinking about it, this was a mistake.
5|Sengoku Nadeko is an indirect victim of the fraud scheme I had going in this town.
5|It wouldn't be strange for her to have heard my name. Perhaps from Araragi or the Fire Sisters.
5|That's what I thought.
5|Kaiki-san!
5|Kaiki-san! Kaiki Deishu-san!
5|That's a strange name! Nice to meet you!
5|Sorry for calling you an old man!
5|Yeah, on second look, you're pretty young! Wow, so young!
5|I think you're younger than me! I'll just call you young master!
5|I'm sure that she heard of my name and knew of it...
5|But she no longer remembers it.
5|This girl has now forgotten the root of all evil that shoved her into the situation she is in now.
5|That's what I thought it was. She plainly forgets things that most cannot forget.
5|But in return, she forever remembers trivial matters...
5|...like how the older brother of a friend was nice to her when she was young.
5|In other words...
5|It was my understanding
5|that the order of importance of events within her mind was all jumbled up.
5|Right now, I'm eagerly waiting for March to arrive!
5|Should I say it? I'm gonna say it!
5|When the time comes... Can you believe it?
5|I get to totally kill the person I love!
5|I was asked to wait six months, so I'm here waiting.
5|Since I'm a god, I thought that I should listen to requests, after all.
5|The feeling that I can't wait that long grows stronger lately, but I have to wait and bear with it!
5|A god has to keep her promises!
5|10000
5|Fake Bank
5|Ten Thousand Yen
5|Right. Keeping promises is very important. You could even say it's sublime.
5|I shape my replies to the conversation with words I don't mean.
5|This girl seemed very pitiful, and I could no longer say anything to disapprove of what she said.
5|That's how you can think of it.
5|She frolics at company, or rather a shrine visitor, arriving.
5|This god, reminiscent of a junior high kid, tries to make good conversation so the visitor has fun.
5|It was nothing but comical and pitiful.
5|I couldn't help but sympathize.
5|But it's weird. I wonder why nobody comes up here.
5|The shrine is all new and stuff too.
5|I thought lots of people would come to visit.
5|Maybe there isn't enough advertising?
5|Or maybe there aren't enough services.
5|Services? Do you mean sexual favors when you say services?
5|Koyomi-oniichan was really happy when I went topless and wore just bloomers!
5|What in the hell is that boy doing?
5|And he was watching so happily when I was writhing about in a school swimsuit...
5|...right here in this shrine!
5|I was so happy that Koyomi-oniichan was pleased by that!
5|You know, um, you....
5|So you and this... Koyomi-oniichan?
5|I don't know if Koyomi is his first or last name...
5|You're in love with Koyomi-oniichan?
5|Yup! I totally love him!
5|That's why I'm going to kill him!
5|Totally kill him!
5|I see.
5|I'm going to kill Koyomi-oniichan's girlfriend what's-her-name...
5|...and that young girl slave what's-her-name too!
5|Hey, god. If you were able to go back to being human, would you like to?
5|Nope.
5|Even if you could be dating Koyomi-oniichan once you turned back to a human?
5|Yup.
5|I'm fine with my love not being answered.
5|If I could keep loving someone forever with no answer...
5|...don't you think that's happier than loving each other, Kaiki-san?
5|You're right.
5|Koyomi-oniichan has come to this shrine many times already, right?
5|You're not including him as a visitor... As company?
5|Yeah, because Koyomi-oniichan keeps telling me nonsense.
5|I don't get it, so I just shoo him away.
5|March is when I get to kill Koyomi-oniichan, so I told him to come back then.
5|But he's really annoying, so I often pretend that I'm not here.
5|Nobody else really comes here at all?
5|Are you sure that nobody really came here at all other than Koyomi-oniichan and myself?
5|In the beginning, a few people came by, but they all ran away when I went out to greet them.
5|Why is that?
5|Kaiki-san, you're the first person that didn't run away and the first to put money in the offertory box!
5|So, thanks!
5|Everyone probably runs away when they see you because you look creepy.
5|That hairdo of yours is way too scary.
5|Creepy? Too scary?
5|Nobody's ever said that to me before.
5|Everyone always just tells me how cute I am.
5|For this girl, "cute" is no longer a compliment or something she's happy to hear.
5|Or rather, those words have probably limited her from doing many activities.
5|So something insulting, basically bad-mouthing, does a full circle and she's happy about it.
5|True enough... True enough that if that's the case...
5|...it's best for her to continue to be a god, rather than return to being human.
5|After thinking of that, my heart began sink, but even if that's the case...
5|...I realized it has nothing to do with me.
5|I see. So I'm creepy and too scary, huh?
5|Then, if I tie up these snake-hairs with a scrunchie...
5|...will I give off a different image?
5|It's getting late, so I'm going to head out soon.

5|What, you know what it is?
5|Yeah. It's Nobita-kun's favorite. He's good at cat's cradle, napping, and sharpshooting.
5|But I don't know much about cat's cradle...
5|I'll teach you a few patterns.
5|I'll come by again before you've perfected them.

6|There's something I'd like to talk about in person, and as soon as possible.
6|Fine.
6|I'll do as you say.
6|I'll be your dog for now.
6|For these two-and-a-half months, at least.
6|Well, isn't that nice?
6|Hey, Kaiki.
6|I'd like you to tell me something.
6|As a middle-aged man, how does it feel to be able to do anything you want to a high school girl?
6|Oh, let's see.

6|Didn't I also end up paying for your drink at that cafe, too?
6|Well...
6|Please give me some more time.
6|You should probably think of the consequences before you speak.
6|I bet you also spoke to Sengoku Nadeko without thinking.
6|Aren't you suffocating in that?
6|Take off your coat. It's annoying.
6|We may be just outside town,
6|but it's still quite likely that I'll be seen by someone I know.
6|So...
6|Why don't you just tell Araragi?
6|Give him a logical and thorough explanation with a cool head.
6|I'm sure he's not stubborn enough to hold it against you.
6|Well yeah,
6|but he seems to have the wrong idea about the two of us.
6|Wrong idea?
6|He thinks you were my first love.
6|All because you said something unnecessary— or well, told a malicious lie—back then.
6|So sorry about that.
6|You were just tricked into dancing on the palm of my hand, right?
6|Let me ask you something, Senjougahara.
6|What?
6|Do you take your bag with you if you have to leave the table at dinner?
6|Huh? Where did that come from?
6|Well, I guess I will take it along when I'm eating with you.
6|Don't bring me into the equation.
6|Let's see...
6|For example, you said you celebrated the New Year at Araragi's place today.
6|When you stepped out into the corridors to talk to me, did you take your bag with you?
6|Why would I?
6|That's a little rude, even for me.
6|I guess so.
6|Why would you ask me that all of a sudden?
6|Well, I just figured Sengoku Nadeko would be sure to take her bag along with her.
6|That's the impression I got when I met her today.
6|You managed to meet her?
6|Today? Just a while ago? Out of the blue?
6|Is it really that simple?
6|She's a god, you know.
6|It can't be!
6|Or are you actually a genuine—
6|I'm...
6|You know I'm a fake.
6|It's safe to assume she lived for the past thirteen or so years without trusting anybody.
6|That's how I felt.
6|That's not true.
6|As far as I know, she trusted Araragi completely.
6|If she really did, things wouldn't have ended up like this.
6|Mister Tomiaki at the shrine office
6|Those who haven't... please do not proceed beyond this point.
6|Polar
6|Though Araragi's chiefly to blame for that. There's no room for excuses.
6|Sticking up for her, are we?
6|Please don't tell me you fell prey to her cuteness after meeting her in person.
6|Who, me?
6|Right. I guess that's not possible.
6|I apologize.
6|It was wrong of me to assume.
6|I have to say, it's actually quite unpleasant to get such a sincere apology for that.
6|But Senjougahara, Sengoku Nadeko certainly did have rather pitiable circumstances.
6|Pitiable?
6|Even I had to pity her.
6|But that was all in the past.
6|She seems to be enjoying herself now, so it doesn't really matter.
6|You can rest assured, Senjougahara.
6|Huh?
6|Deceiving her would be a piece of cake.
6|Scene no. 177
6|Piece of cake?
6|What do you mean?
6|How can you say deceiving such a dangerous being—
6|a snake god that has transcended humanity—would be a piece of cake?
6|If it were that easy, I wouldn't have asked you to do it.
6|It'd be impossible for you.
6|It'd be impossible for Araragi, too.
6|But it'd possible for anyone else, even if they weren't as good as me.
6|Sengoku Nadeko's an idiot.
6|I'm not saying her grades in school are bad,
6|Scene no. 190
6|or, well, of course those are bad too—
6|Scene no. 190
6|She's probably always had her stupidity and immaturity overlooked.
6|Even for her age, she's childish.
6|Overlooked?
6|Because of her cuteness?
6|Scene no. 196
6|I'm going to keep visiting that shrine to talk to her and win her trust.
6|And then maybe next month, I'll tell her that you and Araragi died in a car accident or something.
6|The end.
6|The end?
6|But just think about it.
6|If you told her that, wouldn't she check for herself whether we're dead or alive?
6|She won't.
6|She won't check.
6|She'll believe it all.
6|How can you be so sure?
6|I can tell just by taking to her.
6|She's so pampered and spoiled that she doesn't expect people to deceive or lie to her.
6|Since she's unable to believe in people, she has no reason to doubt them.
6|That's the kind of environment she's been brought up in.
6|Essentially, she's a sheltered princess.
6|Scene no. 216
6|You say she was an indirect victim of the scam I pulled half a year ago,
6|but maybe she actually thinks it was some kind of mistake
6|that she was the target of a charm—a curse—like that.
6|So basically, you're saying she isn't perceptive of malice?
6|Though, well,
6|considering the risk involved should I fail,
6|I can't exactly call it an easy job.
6|Unlikely as it may be, if she sees through it,
6|I probably won't live to tell the tale.
6|She isn't perceptive of malice, but that's exactly why,
6|when faced with petty malice that one would normally be able to turn a blind eye to,
6|she won't be able to ignore it.
6|So she wants to kill Araragi and me because she was unable to ignore it?
6|Thinking about it the other way round, it is for that trifling reason that she's all over your back.
6|I suppose, being in the second year of middle school, she is a child after all...
6|Scene no. 235
6|By becoming a god, Sengoku Nadeko's actually become more childish.
6|Black
6|Unnumbered Scene
6|You could say she was reborn, so to speak.
6|She might surprisingly turn out to be quite a nice god.
6|Though, of course, she needs a bit more composure to be a dignified one.
6|So rest assured.
6|You guys are more or less saved.
6|Aren't you glad you didn't have to die?
6|Starting this spring, you'll be a budding college student.
6|You can act as lovey-dovey as you want with Araragi.
6|Main St.
6|913
6|You can live as slovenly a life as you please.
6|I guess the lingering issue is how to tell Araragi that things have been resolved.
6|Considering what he knows right now,
6|surely you can't tell him outright that I deceived Sengoku Nadeko.
6|What was that for?
6|Didn't you say you didn't want me treating you to anything?
6|Whatever I steal is an exception.
6|Curious standards you have there.
6|I'll handle Araragi somehow.
6|I promise you won't be bothered.
6|I'll have to somehow convince him to give up on Sengoku Nadeko.
6|Even though not giving up on her is what makes him the person he is...
6|Even though it's what makes him the man I fell in love with.
6|There's a perfect way to do it.
6|Tell Araragi to choose who's more important to him, you or her.
6|Become that sort of annoying woman,
6|and I'm sure he'll give up on her.
6|Excuse me.
6|Scene no. 271
6|She took her bag with her. Good attitude.

6|Senjougahara Hitagi must've finally managed to relax.
6|Of course, if it only concerned her,
6|she might've stubbornly refused to shed any tears.
6|But when she found out that her boyfriend would live too, she couldn't help but cry.
6|That's the sort of girl she is.
6|That's the sort of fool she is.
6|The necessary expenses are the problem here.

6|No, my sister—
6|Whoops. I nearly forgot it was confidential.
6|Confidential?
6|A secret.
6|Still, aren't you supposed to be keeping an eye on her?
6|Ononoki, what on earth are you doing here?
6|I came to you.
6|I came to see you.
6|On Gaen's behalf.
6|Gaen?
6|Gaen Izuko.
6|Scene no. 328
6|Here's a word of advice from her—
6|Hold it right there.
6|I don't want to hear it.
6|Don't say it.
6|Back off, she says.
6|Back off?
6|Yeah!
6|Don't stir up trouble in that town.
6|There were some irregularities, but that place is somewhat stable now.
6|Kaiki, if you do anything stupid,
6|not only will things go back to square one, they'll be even worse than before.
6|So back off.
6|Peace, peace!
6|Did Gaen say that last bit, or is it just part of your latest persona?
6|It's just part of my latest persona.
6|I see.
6|Say it again and I'll kick the shit out of you.
6|I threatened her.
6|Scene no. 345
6|I must seem like Araragi now.

6|You think you can insult me by saying I'm like Araragi and still expect me to treat you?
6|Keep the change.
6|Good work.
6|Gaen acts like she knows me, but she obviously doesn't.
6|This is a problem.
6|If I'm told to back off, that'll obviously motivate me even more.
6|She said she was willing to pay.
6|Three million yen.
6|Thirty Minutes Later
6|Scene no. 372
6|I refuse. Don't think I'm so cheap.
6|Go tell her she's missing a zero.
6|Unfortunately, I can't get in touch with her anymore.
6|Tell her yourself,
6|Brother Kaiki—
6|Kaiki.
6|Basically, I think she's worried about what'll happen should you fail.
6|You're trying to deceive Sengoku Nadeko, aren't you?
6|Who knows?
6|Yeah, you'll probably succeed.
6|What with your skills—
6|Actually, even without them, deceiving her should be a piece of cake.
6|But there's too much risk involved should you fail.
6|Sengoku Nadeko currently has enough supernatural power to destroy a town with ease.
6|Spoiler alert.
6|Gaen's trying her best to fix that town.
6|Normally, the human named Sengoku Nadeko wasn't supposed to become a god.
6|According to Gaen's initial plans, she wanted the senior citizen—
6|No wait. Er, what was it again?
6|It seems she wanted to turn the former Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade into a god.
6|That vampire was once considered to be a god, so she was probably suited for the role.
6|By mistake—or well, it seems someone intervened for some reason—
6|Sengoku Nadeko ended up with the role.
6|Gaen certainly didn't want things to turn out like they did.
6|That said, it's not all that bad, apparently.
6|Wash your heart and body before visiting the gods
6|How to wash your hands
6|1. put a ladle of water on your left hand
6|2. next on your right hand
6|3. hold a little water in your left hand, and rinse your mouth. Cover your mouth with your hand when you spit it out
6|4. wash your left hand again, since it touched your mouth
6|5. finally wash the ladle's handle with the water left
6|This way the next person can do the same easily. Care for each other!
6|Ye... Ah...
6|Oh, I nearly forgot to relay this part of the message.
6|If you refuse to back off, you and I are through.
6|What will you do, Brother Kaiki?
6|I'll think about it.
6|I thought about it earlier, but I'll give it some more thought now.
6|I recall Senjougahara's teary face from last night.
6|I recall the words of gratitude that she spoke to me, of all people.
6|And then I recall my relationship with Gaen, my stake in her,
6|and the proposed sum of three million yen.
6|Ononoki.
6|Black
6|Unnumbered Scene
6|Okay, I'll back off.
6|Scene no. 426
6|Of course, I had no intentions of backing off.
6|Immediately after I received the three million yen from Ononoki,
6|I headed straight to the Shrine of the Polar Snake.
6|In return, I ended up making an enemy out of Gaen,
6|but come to think of it, she was pretty much an enemy of mine already.
6|So I actually felt quite good now that our ties had been severed.
6|It's me, Nadeko!
6|Oh, Kaiki!
6|You came!
6|Of course. I am your first believer, after all.
6|To tell you the truth, I have a wish I'd really like to be fulfilled.
6|So I decided to make a hundred visits to this shrine.
6|A hundred visits, huh?
6|I did that too...
6|I think.
6|Or maybe not?
6|So what's your wish?
6|Is it something I can fulfill?
6|Well, it's hard to say in one sentence.
6|But if I had to, I want my business to thrive.
6|Business to thrive?
6|I'm going to come here a hundred times—
6|ninety-eight more times, to be precise.
6|There's no rush.
6|I'll tell you all about it as we go along.
6|Yup! You're right!
6|Tell me about yourself as we go along!
6|I'll lend you an ear.
6|I'm a god, after all!
6|Anyway, teach me how to play cat's cradle today.
6|You promised!
6|I mastered pretty much everything you taught me yesterday.
6|Cat's cradle, eh?
6|Fine. Show me what you did yesterday.
6|Oh, the thread snapped after how much I played with it yesterday.
6|So I practiced with this instead.
6|Show me, Kaiki!
6|This girl's not only an idiot, but also insane.

6|That realization hit me a while after I came down from the mountain.
6|The most likely culprit being one of Gaen's underlings.
6|The next most likely one would be a middle schooler with a grudge against me, I suppose.
6|But in that case, they could've attacked me from behind,

6|In the end, I never took a train from the station I took the taxi to.

6|I didn't go back to the hotel, either.
6|I ended up going straight back to the town I was originally in.
6|It's not that I was worried about being followed.
6|That had already stopped bothering me completely.
6|There was something else bothering me—
6|how utterly insane Sengoku Nadeko was.
6|I found a clue of sorts that could lead to my missing daughter.
6|It's not something I can mention over the phone,
6|and I want to hear your thoughts too,
6|so could you come see me at this place now?
6|I said something like that in a very roundabout manner.
6|In other words, I acted extremely reserved.
6|But I made it considerably hard to refuse as I spoke to them.
6|Now, then.
6|What the hell?!
6|I'm sure
6|that even if all my wishes were to come true
6|I'd come to desire something else
6|and come to regret it in turn
6|My love and the time I lacked
6|will be my path into the future

6|There's someone I love,
6|and we haven't even managed to accept the fact

7|I'm reporting about my job. Can you step out for a bit while the trains are still running?
7|Huh?
7|There's something I'd like to talk about in person. As soon as possible.
7|All right.
7|I'll do as you say. I'm your dog.
7|At least for the next two and a half months.
7|That's a great idea.
7|You know, Kaiki, there's one thing I'd like you to tell me.
7|As a middle-aged man, how does it feel to be able to have your way with a high-school girl?
7|Let's see.
7|At the least, it's not a bad thing to watch a spoiled brat...
7|...knowing her place and obediently hanging her head down.

7|You look like a decent human if you wear clothes of that sort.

7|I'm sure you talked to Sengoku Nadeko like that without much thought.
7|Why aren't you taking that hot-looking thing off?
7|Take it off. It's annoying me.
7|Though I'm away from my town, the chance that someone I know will see us isn't that low...
7|So...
7|Why don't you be honest with Araragi and talk to him about this?
7|If you were frank yet polite, and explained it to him logically without becoming emotional...
7|...he can't be so square-headed that he'd still be against it.
7|That's true, but...
7|I think Araragi-kun has a misunderstanding about my relationship with you.
7|Misunderstanding?
7|He's got the mistaken notion that you were my first crush.
7|Because back then you made a lie you didn't have to, or rather, one you made with malice...
7|Well, sorry about that.
7|You were only deceived by me and toyed around to my liking.
7|You know, Senjougahara. I want to ask you something.
7|What?
7|When you're eating out like this...
7|...do you take your bag when you leave your seat?
7|Huh? What's this all of a sudden?
7|At the least, I'd take it with me when I'm eating a meal with you.
7|Don't assume it's me.
7|Let's see... For example, earlier today you were celebrating the new year at Araragi's house.
7|Did you take your bag with you when you stepped into the hallway to answer my call?
7|Of course not. Not even I would do something that rude.
7|Hmm. Well, that's probably true.
7|Why are you asking something like that all of a sudden?
7|You know, Sengoku Nadeko was probably the type...
7|...that would take her bag with her in times like that. I think.
7|That was the impression I had of Sengoku Nadeko when I met her today.
7|You were able to meet Sengoku Nadeko? Today? Just now? Out of the blue?
7|It's that easy to meet her? Though imperfect, a god?
7|That's impossible, or are you really a...
7|I'm a fake. You already know that.
7|She never trusted anyone, never believed in anyone...
7|...during the 13 or 14 years of her life. That's what I thought.
7|That's not really so. At the least, from what I've heard, she completely trusted Araragi.
7|If that really was true, none of this would have happened.
7|Please see Tomiaki-san at the shrine office
7|Those who haven't... please do not proceed beyond this point.
7|Polar
7|Well, Araragi is at fault for that. There is no room for him to make excuses.
7|You're covering for Sengoku Nadeko an awful lot.
7|It can't be. Don't tell me you were...
7|...charmed by her "cuteness" now that you've actually met her?
7|Huh? I was?
7|Right... I guess that would never happen.
7|I'm sorry. I'll admit fault there.
7|Actually, hearing you sincerely apologize about this like that makes me feel unpleasant.
7|Well, Senjougahara...
7|Certainly that girl, Sengoku Nadeko, was in an environment that induces sympathy.
7|Sympathy?
7|Even I sympathized a bit. But that's a story of the past.
7|She seems to be enjoying her current condition, so it shouldn't matter.
7|Senjougahara, you can rest assured for now.
7|Huh?
7|It's really easy to deceive that girl.
7|It's easy? What do you mean?
7|To say that deceiving such a dangerous existence — a snake god surpassing human limits — is easy?
7|If it was something that simple, I wouldn't take my time to request your services.
7|Well, it would be impossible for you, and impossible for Araragi too.
7|But for anyone else, I think it would be possible. Even if it weren't me.
7|Sengoku Nadeko... That girl is an airhead.
7|People probably kept overlooking her foolishness and naivete for all this time.
7|She's very immature for her age.
7|Kept overlooking...
7|I plan on frequenting that shrine from now on...
7|...and I'll keep communicating with Sengoku Nadeko to win her trust.
7|And around next month, I'll tell her that you and Araragi were in a traffic accident and died.
7|That should solve everything.
7|Solve?
7|But normally, if she heard something like that...
7|...wouldn't Sengoku Nadeko first confirm our mortality with her own eyes?
7|She won't.
7|She won't confirm it.
7|She'll take it at face value.
7|How can you be so positive about it?
7|I can tell by talking to her.
7|She's been spoiled way too much, so she's too dependent on others' kindness.
7|Basically, the thought of someone deceiving her or lying to her never enters her mind.
7|She can't believe in people, but she also has no need to doubt people.
7|That was the environment she grew up in.
7|You said she was an indirect victim of the fraud I set up six months ago...
7|...but maybe she herself thinks it was some kind of mistake?
7|About why she would be the target of such a charm... Of such a curse...
7|In other words, she's been dulled to malice.
7|Though, that said, thinking about the risks if I fail...
7|...it's still hard to say this is an easy job.
7|On the one-in-a-million chance she sees through me, I don't think I'll stay alive.
7|Especially because she is dull to malice...
7|...she can't possibly ignore the smallest bit of malice or ill will that would normally be passed by.
7|Because she can't and couldn't ignore things...
7|...she's trying to kill me and Araragi.
7|Sengoku Nadeko is stuck on you, conversely, due to a feeling that shallow.
7|By becoming a deity, it seems that Nadeko has further regressed into immaturity.
7|Right... Maybe the word to use here is reincarnated.
7|Will she possibly end up being a better god than expected?
7|Though, she probably needs to calm down a little more...
7|...to assume the bearing of a god.
7|So rest assured. You guys are probably spared for the most part.
7|Good for you. You won't have to die.
7|You'll be a college student come spring.
7|You can make out with Araragi as much as you want. You can live a life of debauchery.
7|Main St.
7|913
7|Stop
7|Well, the problem is how to tell Araragi that everything has been resolved.
7|Considering the misunderstanding he has now,
7|we can't possibly tell him that I deceived Nadeko.
7|What do you think you're doing? I thought you didn't want me to treat you.
7|If I steal from you, it's okay.
7|Those are strange standards.
7|I'll do something about Araragi-kun.
7|There's no need to trouble you.
7|I'll convince him somehow and have Araragi-kun give up on Sengoku Nadeko.
7|Though it wouldn't be Araragi-kun, the man I fell in love with, if he didn't quit even then.
7|Here's a good way.
7|You should make Araragi choose by asking him, "Who is more important? Me or Sengoku Nadeko?"
7|If you could be such an annoying woman,
7|he'd have no choice but to give up pursuing Sengoku Nadeko.
7|Excuse me.
7|Sorry to make you wait.
7|Kaiki...
7|Thank you. I appreciate it.
7|Senjougahara Hitagi was finally able to relax for the first time.
7|Of course, if it was just about her...
7|...she would have been stubborn and not cried over it.
7|But because it meant her lover's life was also spared, she couldn't help but cry about it.
7|That's the type of girl she is.
7|She's a fool like that.
7|The only problem is the expense to do this.
7|10,000 yen each time I go visit...
7|With what remains of my expenses, I can't even go see her five more times.
7|Parking Spots
7|All right, I memorized them.
7|Yay! Onii-chan! Peace, peace!
7|It's been a while, Kaiki-oniichan. How long has it been?
7|Don't call me Onii-chan.
7|Yay!
7|What happened to Kagenui?
7|Perhaps she's somewhere around here?
7|No, she is...
7|Whoa. That was supposed to be a secret.
7|Secret?
7|It means I can't tell you.
7|But, that said, you're supposed to be keeping an eye on Kagenui, right?
7|Ononoki, what the hell are you doing right now?
7|I came to you.
7|I came to see you.
7|On an errand from Gaen-san.
7|Gaen?
7|A warning from Gaen-san.
7|No. Wait. I don't want to hear it. Don't say anything.
7|She said, "Pull out."
7|Pull out?
7|Yeah!
7|"Someone like you should not meddle with that town."
7|"There were a few irregularities, but that town is now somewhat stable."
7|"Kaiki, if you do something unnecessary, it will all go to waste."
7|"Or rather, it will be worse than before. So, pull out."
7|Peace, peace!
7|Did Gaen-senpai really say that last bit? Or is that how your character is lately?
7|It's how my character is lately.
7|I see. Say it again and I'll punch you away.
7|Do you have anything else you want to drink?
7|Kaiki. You're saying things like you were devil boy.
7|I still have a drink, so I'm fine, but... Let's see...
7|Happy New Year
7|New Year's sale
7|I want to eat a chocolate chunk scone, warmed up.
7|You insulted me by saying I was like Araragi. You really think I'd buy you something now?
7|I don't need any change.
7|I appreciate your efforts.
7|Gaen-senpai seems to understand me, yet doesn't understand me that much.
7|How troublesome.
7|If I'm told to pull out, I'm going to be more gung-ho about finishing it, of course.
7|She said she'd pay if necessary.
7|Three million yen.
7|I decline. Don't think of me so cheaply.
7|Go back and tell her she's off by at least a digit.
7|Unfortunately, at this point, I can't contact Gaen-san anymore.
7|If you want to tell her, tell her yourself, Kaiki-oniichan.
7|Kaiki...
7|In other words...
7|...I think Gaen-san is worrying about what would happen if you fail your job, Kaiki.
7|Kaiki, you're trying to fool Sengoku Nadeko, right?
7|Well, I don't know about that.
7|Yeah, I think that will succeed.
7|With as much talent as you, Kaiki... Well, even without that much...
7|...deceiving that girl is easy.
7|But the risk involved if you were to fail is just too high.
7|Right now, Nadeko has enough godly powers to easily destroy an entire town.
7|Well, as a spoiler...
7|...Gaen-san is the one who's trying to straighten that town out in the first place.
7|The original plans didn't have the human named Sengoku Nadeko becoming a god.
7|Gaen-san's original plans had that old hag...
7|No, wait, what was she?
7|She was planning to make the one that was previously...
7|...Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, into a god.
7|That vampire had been treated as a god once before, so she was fit for the job.
7|But due to some mistake... For some reason, someone intervened.
7|And that job was transferred over to Sengoku Nadeko.
7|The current situation is not one that Gaen-san sought.
7|However... Still, it's not a terribly bad situation either, for sure.
7|Wash your heart and body before visiting the gods
7|How to wash your hands
7|1. put a ladle of water on your left hand
7|2. next on your right hand
7|3. hold a little water in your left hand, and rinse your mouth. Cover your mouth with your hand when you spit it out
7|4. wash your left hand again, since it touched your mouth
7|5. finally wash the ladle's handle with the water left
7|This way the next person can do the same easily.
7|Care for each other!
7|Y...
7|...ay.
7|There's one message I forgot to tell you.
7|"If you don't plan on pulling out, I am no longer your senpai. Our relationship as such is over."
7|What will you do, Kaiki-oniichan?
7|I'll think about it.
7|I thought about it for a moment earlier, but this time I put in a bit more thought.
7|I remembered Senjougahara's cried-out face I saw last night.
7|And her words of thanks. The words of thanks directed at none other than me.
7|Then, my relationship and interests with Gaen-senpai.
7|I was reminded of the proposed sum of three million yen.
7|Ononoki.
7|All right. I'll pull out.
7|Of course, I had no intention of pulling out.
7|After I received the three million yen from Ononoki...
7|...I headed straight over to North Shirahebi Shrine.
7|Of course, I turned Gaen-senpai into one of my enemies in return.
7|But come to think of it, she was like an enemy to begin with.
7|Once my ties to her were gone, I felt slightly refreshed.
7|Here's Nadeko!
7|Oh, Kaiki-san! You came!
7|Of course. I am your number one adherent.
7|Actually, I have a wish that I really, really want granted.
7|So I decided to do the hundred times worship here at this shrine.
7|A hundred times worship, huh?
7|I did that once too maybe... Maybe not?
7|And, what's your wish, Kaiki-san? Is it something I can grant?
7|Well, it's hard to say in one phrase.
7|But if I were forced to summarize it in one phrase, I'd say "prosperous business."
7|Prosperous business...
7|Well, from here on I'm going to be here...
7|...100, or to be more precise, 98 more times.
7|There's no need to rush. I'll tell you in due time.
7|Yeah! That's true!
7|You can tell me about yourself bit by bit, Kaiki-san!
7|I'll listen! I'm a god!
7|So, for today, teach me some cat's cradle! Like you promised!
7|I've already mastered basically all of the ones you taught me yesterday!
7|Cat's cradle, huh? All right. Pull out the rope I gave you yesterday.
7|Oh, that? It snapped because I was playing nonstop.
7|So I used this instead to practice.
7|So, show me, show me, Kaiki-san!
7|This girl is not only stupid, she's also insane.
7|North Shira hebi Shrine
7|She's an airhead. And she's lost her marbles.
7|I felt like someone was shadowing me for a while after I came down the mountain.
7|The most probable theory is, of course, one of Gaen-senpai's "henchmen."
7|The next most probable theory is perhaps a junior high kid who has a grudge against me.
7|But, in that case, they're more likely to show...
7|Fare 411530 Yen

7|...a more direct method of violence, such as a sudden assault from behind.
7|Sir, are you a traveler?
7|Well, kinda.
7|How is it around here?
7|It's pretty fun.
7|Thrilling in all sorts of ways.
7|In the end, I didn't get on a train from the station that the taxi dropped me off at...
7|...nor did I go back to my hotel.
7|20
7|I headed straight back into the town I had just left.
7|I wasn't worried about whoever was shadowing me.
7|I had already completely stopped thinking about that.
7|There was something more worthy of my attention.
7|The manner in which Sengoku Nadeko had been broken.
7|"I found something that looked like a clue concerning my missing daughter."
7|"It's not something I can talk about over the phone...
7|...and I'd like to hear your opinion as well."
7|"So can you come by the location I'm going to specify now?"
7|Or something like that, in a very roundabout way.
7|In other words, in a very reserved manner...
7|...but weaving in a fair bit of inability to refuse, I tell them.

8|Is it serious talk?
8|Has there ever been a time when it wasn't serious?
8|Point taken.
8|I'll just wash up; hold on.
8|Scene no. 60
8|A different issue has come to the surface.
8|That's why I'd like to ask you something.
8|Ask me anything.
8|Have you—
8|Actually, I guess it'd be both you and Araragi.
8|Oshino Shinobu and that Hanekawa, too.
8|When you people were trying to solve this Sengoku Nadeko problem—
8|in other words, before you asked me to deceive her—did anyone ever get in your way?
8|You can also take that as me asking you if you were ever given any warnings.
8|Like a note telling you to back off, for example.
8|Did something happen?
8|As part of my job report,
8|I told Senjougahara about what transpired today.
8|Of course, I didn't tell her everything.
8|But I had no choice but to tell her about Ononoki and Gaen.
8|Gaen, eh?
8|I heard she came to your town a while ago.
8|Did you run into her?
8|No, I did not.
8|Araragi and Hanekawa did get involved, though.
8|In fact, it was Gaen's talisman that ultimately led to Sengoku Nadeko becoming a god.
8|Oh, so you knew too?
8|So did Gaen talk to Araragi or Hanekawa about this?
8|Did she tell them to back off like she did to me?
8|She couldn't possibly tell Araragi that.
8|It'd basically be like telling him to roll over and die.
8|That's just absurd.
8|Even a pre-schooler knows that.
8|True.
8|But it seems she did say something mean to Hanekawa the one time they met.
8|Maybe Araragi got a dose of that too.
8|That said, I don't think Hanekawa was forced into doing anything.
8|She said it was more like a warning of sorts.
8|I bet it was.
8|She didn't force me to do anything either.
8|Though now we've cut connections.
8|Scene no. 87
8|Kaiki, if you're thinking about talking to Hanekawa about this,
8|you'd best give up on that idea.
8|I mean, she's overseas right now.
8|Overseas?
8|To look for Oshino?
8|Forget about it, then.
8|Anyway, it looks like Gaen's afraid that I'll fail.
8|While it's out of the question,
8|she's scared of what'll happen if I don't succeed in fulfilling your request to deceive Sengoku Nadeko.
8|I don't get it.

8|Wouldn't things only go back to the way they were before, with Araragi and me getting killed?

8|Isn't that what Gaen's expecting?
8|No.
8|I think she's afraid Sengoku Nadeko will go on a rampage if she finds out we tried to deceive her.
8|Well, that I can understand.
8|It's like how confessing to someone and getting rejected is fine,
8|but if they lied about it, saying they had a girlfriend, that would be crossing the line,

8|I guess?
8|With that,

8|Scene no. 101
8|However,
8|Scene no. 101
8|Yeah.
8|That's right.
8|So Kaiki, going back to what you said earlier...
8|Gaen was willing to pay you the huge sum of three million yen, right?
8|What made you refuse?
8|I mean, why didn't you back off right then and there?
8|What, did you want me to back off?
8|That's not what I mean.
8|I'm just worried because I don't know what you're thinking.
8|I understand her feelings, though she says disturbing things like they are nothing.
8|Scene no. 106
8|Did you figure out a way to swindle even more than three million yen or something?
8|I kept quiet.
8|Scene no. 108
8|I apologize.
8|That was awful of me.
8|That was easy.
8|Scene no. 109
8|But really, why?
8|Of course, I'm grateful that you'll still do your job,
8|but you can understand why I'd be worried, right?
8|There's no need to figure out a way to swindle more than three million yen, is there?
8|I already got my hands on that money.
8|One hundred thousand yen plus three million yen. That's three million one hundred thousand yen, clearly more than three million.
8|Scene no. 114
8|Fair enough.
8|I can get the same amount of money whether I do my job or quit, so of course I'll still do it.
8|It's as simple as that.
8|Wouldn't you normally quit if you could still get the same amount of money?
8|That's how a child thinks.
8|Adults don't abandon their jobs that easily.
8|Don't treat me like a child.
8|Scene no. 120
8|Anyway, forget about Gaen.
8|With my pursuer in mind,
8|Scene no. 121
8|It's in the past now.
8|She wouldn't resort to using force just because I took her three million yen and still didn't back off.
8|She wouldn't give someone the same warning twice, either.
8|That's exactly why it's so strange.
8|Who was this Cat's Eye that sneaked into my room while I was away and left a note with the same message?
8|I have no idea who it was,
8|but I don't think you need to be Cat's Eye to do something that simple.
8|It's just an envelope. You could easily slip it in under the door.
8|Scene no. 141
8|I fell silent,
8|Scene no. 141
8|and after contemplating the plausibility of her words,
8|Scene no. 141
8|realized there was no refuting her hypothesis.
8|Scene no. 141
8|I see.
8|A plausible theory.
8|Anyone could identify the hotel you're staying in without much difficulty, right?
8|At the very least, someone who wants to make you stop what you're doing now should be able to.
8|The person who was tailing you bothers me, too.
8|That could be someone completely unrelated to this case, though.
8|Right.
8|Especially considering everything you did in this town.
8|But think about it this way.
8|Wouldn't it be more worrying if they were unrelated?
8|It's the usual.
8|Doesn't bother me at all.
8|In fact, I'd prefer it if it were the usual.
8|I can't have what looked to be an easy job get complicated at this stage.
8|That's why I called you.
8|I thought that maybe you'd have an idea.
8|Unfortunately, I don't.
8|To begin with, I haven't even told anyone that I asked you to take up this job.
8|Someone could've found out without your telling them, you know.
8|Maybe they overheard you talking to me in the corridor at Araragi's place, for example.
8|No.
8|The only possibility I can think of is that Araragi could've found out by sneaking a peek at my cellphone.
8|A boyfriend

8|Araragi wouldn't do something like that.
8|Red
8|Unnumbered Scene
8|Indeed.
8|You're right.
8|What's more, even if he realized something was up from the way I was acting,
8|he wouldn't do something as roundabout as leaving an anonymous note.
8|He'd talk to you face-to-face.
8|Yeah.
8|I'll look into it either way, just in case.
8|There's a chance that unlike Gaen, the sender might directly hinder my deceiving Sengoku Nadeko.
8|Okay.
8|The note was handwritten, right?
8|Stay out of it
8|Yeah, it was.
8|It felt like they took great care not to leave any characteristics of their handwriting behind.
8|I see.
8|But I may be able to recognize it if I see it with my own eyes.
8|It's too late tonight, but could you show it to me tomorrow?
8|I thought you didn't have any ideas.
8|I'm just making sure.
8|I appreciate the fact that you're being careful, but that's not happening.
8|I tore that note up and disposed of it already.

8|I carelessly thought I was talking to Araragi.
8|I was unable to determine if she was trying to help me or not. Oh well, I thought, and ignored that. No point bullying the children.
8|Scene no. 176
8|Well, it was a note addressed to me and left in my room.
8|I'll take care of it as part of my job.
8|You don't have to worry about it.
8|You don't have to do anything.
8|Go be lovey-dovey with Araragi or something.
8|That's not right.
8|Of course, I want you to do your job,
8|and I'll leave you to your devices,
8|but I must do what I can, too.
8|I don't think she was saying that out of dedication.
8|She was probably keeping her bases covered in case I backed off or betrayed her and ran away.
8|A wise move.
8|Though, well, I won't ask her what exactly she's doing.
8|By the way, Kaiki.
8|What?
8|Do you really intend to visit Sengoku Nadeko a hundred times?
8|Yeah.
8|Well, not really.
8|I obviously don't want to climb those stairs a hundred times.
8|I think I'll go see her every day until the end of January, though.
8|Every day?
8|That would cost about three hundred thousand yen.
8|It should be part of the necessary expenses, but the "settlement" I got from Gaen is more than enough.
8|Paying ten thousand yen every time you see her? Almost sounds like you're going to a hostess bar.
8|To be honest, I'm worried about that.
8|Worried you might fall prey to her if you see her every day.

8|So how can you be so sure she's enchanting?
8|I only saw her as an idiot.
8|Yes.
8|But it's precisely because I haven't met her that I'm so sure about this—
8|that I have to advise you to reconsider going to see her every day.
8|All right.

8|After buying some thread for cat's cradle,
8|I decided to buy something else to take along.
8|Putting a ten thousand yen bill in the offerings box should be enough to draw that snake god out.
8|She'll jump out, saying, "It's me, Nadeko!" like she was waiting for it.
8|But Senjougahara said it sounded like I was frequenting a hostess bar.
8|Perhaps that was bothering me.
8|No Facsimiles
8|After some deliberation, I decided to buy some sake.
8|I figured there weren't many men around who'd bring their own booze to a meeting with the hostess of their dreams.
8|Oh, don't question my morals for giving a middle school girl alcohol.
8|That isn't applicable here.
8|She's no longer a middle schooler or even human—she's a god.
8|They say no god turns down an offering of wine.
8|So if she refuses to drink this, she wouldn't be qualified to be a god.
8|In a way, you could even say it'd resolve everything.

8|4. wash your left hand again, since it touched your mouth
8|5. finally wash the ladle's handle with the water left

8|Is there any point in spending that valuable time meeting me?
8|Yes, there is.

9|Just how many people know that I am staying in this hotel?
9|However, even if they pinpointed my location, to put a letter inside a locked hotel room...
9|That's impossible for anyone to do.
9|There's no way. Is one of the hotel workers colluding with my enemy?
9|Enemy?
9|What is the enemy?
9|Isn't my enemy right now that young deity?
9|Maybe I'm up against some extraordinary syndicate.

9|Hey, Kaiki, are you feeling lonely?
9|You've been calling me each and every night...
9|Senjougahara, I want to ask you something.
9|What? I'm wearing blue lingerie today.
9|Wake up, Senjougahara.
9|I'm awake. Mumble, mumble...
9|Don't mumble at me.
9|Zzz...
9|That's not half-asleep, that's fully asleep.
9|What? You calling me out somewhere again?
9|Fine, I'll go anywhere for you. Should we meet up at the Mister Donut we went to yesterday?
9|No, you don't have to come over today.
9|That's not it. I want to ask you something.
9|What? Is this something serious?
9|Do we ever have something not-so-serious to talk about?
9|Good point...
9|I have a new problem now. So I wanted to ask you something.
9|Ask me anything.
9|You... Or rather, you and Araragi...
9|Also, Oshino Shinobu and that girl named Hanekawa.
9|When all you guys tried to solve the issue concerning Sengoku Nadeko...
9|In other words, before you came to me with your request, had anyone gotten in your way?
9|Rather than if someone got in your way, I'm wondering if someone gave you a warning.
9|Something like receiving a letter telling you to "pull out"...
9|Something happened?
9|While I reported on my job's progress,
9|I told Senjougahara about the events that happened today.
9|I didn't talk about everything that happened.
9|But I had no choice but to disclose the info about Ononoki and Gaen-senpai at this point.
9|I see... Gaen-san, huh?
9|She said she was over at your town a while back. Did you get to meet her?
9|No, I didn't meet her.
9|But Araragi-kun and Hanekawa-san both had something to do with her.
9|Or rather, the reason Sengoku Nadeko became a god was because of Gaen-san's talisman to begin with...
9|Oh, so you knew about that too?
9|Then, is Gaen-senpai warning Araragi and that Hanekawa like she's warning me?
9|To pull out of this case?
9|She wouldn't say it to Araragi-kun...
9|Because that's basically telling him to be killed without resisting.
9|Even a kindergartner would know that's something pretty reckless.
9|That's true.
9|But Hanekawa-san has met her once, and I think she said something very unpleasant then.
9|So perhaps Araragi was told something of that nature as well.
9|Hmm...
9|Though, that said, it doesn't seem like Hanekawa-san was forced to do anything either.
9|In her words, it was more like a piece of advice.
9|Figures. She didn't force me to do anything either.
9|Kaiki. If you want to talk to Hanekawa-san right now, I think you should give up on that.
9|Because Hanekawa-san is overseas right now.
9|Overseas? She looking for Oshino or something?
9|Well then, that's fine.
9|In any case, it seems Gaen-senpai fears that I'm going to fail.
9|That's impossible, but in the case that I don't fulfill your request to deceive Sengoku Nadeko...
9|In that case, as originally planned, Araragi and I just die, right?
9|That seems like how Gaen-san planned for things to be.
9|No, I think she fears that Nadeko will go into a frenzy if she realizes she's been deceived.
9|Well, I kind of understand that.
9|In other words, it's like if a girl is okay with being rejected,
9|but can't tolerate it if the guy rejects her by lying that he "already has a girlfriend."
9|Yeah, that's it. Just like that.
9|Then, what you said earlier... You were offered 3 million yen from Gaen-san, right?
9|Why did you refuse? In other words, why didn't you pull out right then?
9|What, you wanted me to pull out?
9|That's not what I mean. But not knowing your intentions makes me uneasy.
9|Or did you dodge the situation...
9|...and figure out some way to end up with more than 3 million yen?
9|I'm sorry. I said something horrible.
9|But really, why?
9|Of course, I'm grateful that you accepted my offer...
9|...but you can understand my uneasiness, right?
9|There is no need for me to figure out a means to gain more than 3 million yen.
9|Because I already have that money.
9|Well, that's true...
9|I get the same amount of money whether I continue or I stop...
9|...so of course I'll keep going.
9|It's very simple logic.
9|If you were paid the same regardless, wouldn't you quit your job?
9|That's childish logic. Adults don't toss out their jobs so nonchalantly.
9|Don't treat me like a child.
9|That said, Gaen-senpai doesn't matter anymore.
9|It's over and done with.
9|She's not the type that would use force to get her way, even if I didn't pull out...
9|...after taking the 3 million yen.
9|She's also not the type that would give two warnings.
9|That's why I'm perplexed.
9|Who is this Cat's Eye that snuck into...
9|...my hotel room while I was out, and left a letter with the same message?
9|Well, I don't know who...
9|...but anyone could probably leave a letter in your absence.
9|It wouldn't have to be someone from Cat's Eye.
9|You can just slide an envelope underneath the door.
9|I see. That's rational to consider.
9|It's not that difficult for someone to deduce the hotel you're staying in, right?
9|At least, it wouldn't be impossible for people that want to stop you from finishing your current job.
9|That guy shadowing you bothers me too...
9|Though the shadower may be a completely different case that has nothing to do with this.
9|True. You've done quite a bit in this town already.
9|If the two things are unrelated, wouldn't that be more of an issue?
9|It's always like this. Nothing to worry about.
9|I'm more thankful for "the usual" at this point.
9|I don't want work that I expected to wrap up so neatly to suddenly become complicated.
9|That's why I called you.
9|I thought that you might have a clue.
9|Unfortunately, I don't.
9|In the first place, I haven't told anyone that I've requested this from you.
9|Sometimes people find out without you telling them.
9|Like, maybe someone overheard you talking to me in the hallway of the Araragi residence?
9|No.
9|Well, if there's any possibility...
9|...Araragi might have caught on if he checked my cell phone without me knowing?
9|Come now. Araragi isn't the type that would do such a thing.
9|Yes, right. You're correct.
9|Besides, even if he caught on to something from my attitude...
9|...he wouldn't be so roundabout in sending out an anonymous note.
9|He'd tell you directly.
9|Right.
9|In any case, I guess I'll check it out just in case...
9|The sender of the letter, unlike Gaen-senpai, may try to hinder me from deceiving Sengoku Nadeko.
9|True... That letter was hand-written, right?
9|Stay out of it
9|Yeah, that's right. It was written in a way to try to purposefully hide any characteristics.
9|I see. But if I looked at it, I might know who wrote it.
9|Tonight is too late for sure, but can you show it to me tomorrow or something?
9|Didn't you say you didn't have a clue?
9|Just in case.
9|It's not bad to be so cautious, but that's impossible.
9|I already ripped up the note and threw it away.
9|Huh?
9|I also flushed it down the toilet, so it's impossible to reassemble.
9|Why did you do such a thing? It's an important piece of evidence.
9|Evidence? I'm not a cop.
9|And you know well enough already.
9|I always quickly throw out things I don't need...
9|...or things I find unpleasant and never keep them at hand.
9|Yes, I know that. That's how you tossed me out too.
9|What, did I toss you out?
9|Slip of the tongue.
9|Tch.
9|I foolishly thought I was talking to Araragi.
9|Well, it's a letter that was in my room, which means it was meant for me.
9|I'll do something about it as part of the job, so you don't have to worry about it.
9|You don't have to do anything.
9|Just go make out with Araragi.
9|I can't do that.
9|No, I do want you to do your job, and I'll leave everything concerning the job to you.
9|But I have to do what I can as well.
9|That's not much of an effort...
9|...but she's considering the possibility that I'll "pull out" or even betray and bail on her.
9|How sensible. Well, I won't ask what she'll be doing.
9|By the way, Kaiki...
9|What?
9|Are you really planning on doing the hundred times worship with Sengoku Nadeko? No lies?
9|Yeah... Oh no, there are lies.
9|Of course I don't intend to climb those stairs a hundred times.
9|Though, I think I'm going to visit every day until the end of January.
9|Every day...
9|So my expenses are going to be roughly 300,000 yen.
9|They are necessary expenses, but Gaen-senpai's severance payment is more than enough to cover it.
9|10,000 yen each time you see her... It sounds like you're frequenting a cabaret club.
9|To be honest, that's a point I'm still uncertain about.
9|I'm worried that Sengoku Nadeko will beguile you if you see her every day.
9|Senjougahara, what? Are you jealous?
9|My bad.
9|I'm not joking.
9|That girl is an enchantress.
9|Did you know Sengoku Nadeko before all this?
9|No. She was just an acquaintance, a friend, of Araragi-kun...
9|I didn't even know of her existence until she became a god.
9|Then how can you be sure that she's an enchantress?
9|The only thing I felt was that she was an airhead.
9|Really?
9|But, I can say this precisely because I've never met her...
9|I have to advise you... Rethink going to see her every day.
9|All right. I'll listen to your advice gratefully.
9|Maybe so. It might be better if I didn't go see her every day.
9|I just hope the snake poison isn't addicting.

9|Purchase more strings for Cat's Cradle
9|Playing cat's cradle with Ouroboros once is more than enough in a lifetime.
9|4th of January
9|After buying string for cat's cradle, I thought of buying something else while I was shopping.
9|If I put 10,000 yen into the offertory box...
9|...that snake god will come out happily, saying "Here's Nadeko!"
9|But it felt like I was worried about...
9|...how Senjougahara said that it was as if I was "frequenting a cabaret club."
9|After much thought, I decided to buy some sake and take it up.
9|No Facsimiles
9|My conclusion was that men usually don't buy locally brewed sake for the cabaret club girls that they long for.
9|The ethical criticism about making a junior high girl drink doesn't apply.
9|She's no longer a junior high girl, let alone even human. She is a god.
9|They say no god ever refuses sacred sake...
9|So much so that if she were not to drink this sake, then she would fail as a god...
9|...and in a way, the problem would resolve itself.
9|Wash your heart and body before visiting the gods
9|How to wash your hands
9|1. put a ladle of water on your left hand
9|2. next on your right hand
9|3. hold a little water in your left hand, and rinse your mouth. Cover your mouth with your hand when you spit it out
9|4. wash your left hand again, since it touched your mouth
9|5. finally wash the ladle's handle with the water left
9|This way the next person can do the same easily.
9|Care for each other!
9|H-Here's, Nade... Huh!
9|T-Twenty thousand yen?
9|W-What, Kaiki-san, did you make a mistake?
9|You realize you're not getting this back?
9|Doesn't matter.
9|Oh! Are you paying in advance for tomorrow?
9|That's for today. And...
9|...a care package.
9|It's sake! I've been wanting to have some!
9|Looks like she can handle her liquor. Unfortunately, it seems she is a god.
9|Dad only drank beer. This is the first time I'm going to have sake!
9|Kaiki-san, what's the difference between sake and beer?
9|Sake is made from rice, and beer is made from barley.
9|Here, I brought you some.
9|Thanks!
9|Now I can pass the time until I kill Koyomi-oniichan off!
9|You say passing the time, Sengoku, but cat's cradle is a profound art.
9|Hello, Kaiki Deishu-san.
9|It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Hanekawa Tsubasa, classmates with Senjougahara and Araragi.
9|I'm...
9|...Kaiki Deishu...
9|Though, there doesn't seem to be much need for self-introductions of that sort.
9|I imagine you've heard of me from Senjougahara and Araragi?
9|Yes.
9|Though, to be honest...
9|...I knew about you before I heard about you from the two of them.
9|I had assisted with an investigation by the Fire Sisters...
9|Kids... shouldn't speak in such a humble manner.
9|You want to talk to me, right? I'll listen. Allow me to listen.
9|It's not like I don't have anything I want to talk to you about either.

9|Oh, no, that wasn't a lie.
9|Or rather, Senjougahara-san doesn't think that it is a lie.

9|But I thought I might break through by pulling this feint trick.
9|Break through?
9|Yes. Well, I kind of already knew that Oshino-san wasn't overseas.
9|So I felt that I still did it because I had nothing to lose.

9|True. I heard you directly received some advice from Gaen-senpai.
9|How to put it... What a misfortune.
9|I wanted her to think that I was taking irrelevant actions, so to say...
9|So I did come back home for an instant like this, but I'm going to fly out again tomorrow morning.
9|Coming back for an instant... Is there some meaning in using such precious time to contact me?
9|Yes, there is.
9|It seems like this sort of thing is pretty useless against Gaen-san, who knows everything.
9|But by going overseas, it was easier for Senjougahara-san to act.
9|And I was glad to find out she got in touch with you.
9|It was a happy miscalculation, or rather, a happy calculation gone as planned.
9|Kaiki-san.
9|Please help Senjougahara-san out.
9|If you don't mind, I'd like to talk in the hotel room where I'm staying.
9|Would that be all right?
9|It's a cheap room, so I'm sure it's a different hotel from where you are staying...
9|...but I also have a room in this area.
9|I don't mind, but...
9|Happy New Year's
9|Oh, that's fine.
9|I don't mind things like that too much.
9|Besides...
9|I think I do have a good eye for men.
9|You know, Hanekawa, you have something to talk to me about...
9|...and I have something to talk to you about.
9|So I'm not reluctant to talk about those things.
9|Or rather, I'd like to talk about them.
9|But first, I want to ensure our intentions are identical. Is that okay?
9|Identical intentions?
9|Yeah. It seems that for this current case...
9|...all sorts of people are thinking all sorts of things, and many opinions are crossing over.
9|To those that make a living from work of my sort, people's feelings are most important.
9|I see.
9|That's why I want to know.
9|Hanekawa, your position is one to "save" Senjougahara and Araragi, yes?
9|I want to save Senjougahara-san and Araragi-kun.
9|But, it doesn't have to be me who saves them.
9|I just don't want those two to die, so I don't care who saves them.
9|Whether it be me, Oshino-san, or you...
9|Do you swear to a god?
9|I swear to a cat.
9|You're not going to ask?
9|You're not going to ask me anything?
9|Where I stand, or rather, how I feel?
9|My client, Senjougahara, seems to worry about those a whole lot.
9|You don't want to confirm those with me?
9|Do you wonder why I accepted Senjougahara's request?
9|And whether or not I intend on going through with the request?
9|I'm not going to ask.
9|Well, then, I'd like to delve into the main topic...
9|Wait.
9|Why aren't you asking? Are you saying that you can see through my feelings?
9|So those sorts of things aren't even worth asking...
9|Hmph, it seems like you know everything, young lady.
9|It's not that I know everything. I just know what I know.
9|Fine...
9|Yes?
9|Let's get to the main topic. How about we exchange some information, Hanekawa?

9|Have you heard of mudslinging?

9|High Dive
9|Ah! I remember!

9|Team A and Team B are waging an all-out mudslinging war. Who do you think's gonna win?
9|......Sob.
9|To think they saw the proper way in my handbook.
9|Sounds like a real quiz, that's a first—
9|WHO's gonna win?
9|If they're both throwing dirt at each other, nobody's going to win.
9|Wrong, the right answer is: It ends in a draw. Why is that? Because "DRAW-jiai"!

10|Thus, I finally understood exactly what happened in that town over the past few months.
10|Hearing about it from Hanekawa was,
10|at the very least, more effective than hearing from Senjougahara
10|in helping me gain an objective grasp on the situation.
10|I also found out the particulars of how Sengoku Nadeko became a god and all the damage it caused.

10|Most of it was pretty absurd.
10|How should I say this?
10|Going by what you said,
10|instead of assuming Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade's arrival caused the disturbances there,
10|it would be more accurate to assume
10|that she was drawn to that town because it was under a spiritual disturbance to begin with.
10|At the very least, Gaen seemed to think so, though she didn't say so herself.
10|That's why she tried to appoint a new god at the Shrine of the Polar Snake.
10|Araragi's rejection of that idea was what eventually turned an innocent middle school girl into a god.
10|"Innocent middle school girl," eh?
10|What is it?
10|Nothing.
10|There's no reason to inquire further.
10|Scene no. 35
10|By the way, have you ever met Sengoku Nadeko?
10|If you have, what was your impression of her?
10|She was a meek, timid, shy, and reserved girl.
10|That's unexpectedly ordinary.
10|Scene no. 45
10|Did I expect too much from a child?
10|Scene no. 45
10|I never got that kind of impression from her.
10|What I saw in her was a complete lack of interest.
10|Lack of interest?
10|You mean she seemed like the type to be ignored in class?
10|No, that's not it.
10|The one being shown a complete lack of interest was me.
10|Me and everyone else.
10|Her world is completely closed.
10|No matter what anyone says, those words won't reach her.
10|I think Oshino was quite worried about her too.
10|But in the end, not even those worries of his were able to reach her.
10|I wouldn't have been able to say this before now,
10|but although she says she loves Araragi,
10|and even though it seems to be why she wants to kill him and Senjougahara,
10|I don't think that girl actually loves anyone.
10|Nobody even registers on her radar.
10|Well, she more or less has a keen eye.
10|Scene no. 72
10|I want to save her too if I can.
10|Well, don't expect me to do it.
10|What I've been asked to do is deceive Sengoku Nadeko.
10|I know.
10|That was just me being greedy.
10|But if "I want to save her" was an expression of your desire to turn her back into a human,
10|you should reconsider that.
10|You probably haven't spoken to her since she became a god, so let me tell you:
10|she seems happy right now.
10|You can't call her "happy" just because she thinks she is.
10|That so?
10|Yes, that's what I think.
10|She seems to think so. She seems to think so quite adamantly. I don't know. I wonder if it's based off of her own experience.
10|Scene no. 98
10|Well, you're free to believe whatever you want.
10|Go ahead and save her once I'm done deceiving her.
10|1008
10|Huh?
10|Doesn't that make my job more difficult?
10|I was planning on living a nomadic life once I graduated,
10|but I guess things don't always go your away.
10|She shouldn't try to imitate what Oshino is doing
10|Scene no. 105
10|This might be an inappropriate thing to ask, but Kaiki...
10|Go ahead. This is no time to be worried about that.
10|Do you think you can actually deceive her?
10|That's a strange way to phrase it.
10|Like I said to Senjougahara,
10|deceiving her would be a piece of cake.
10|Don't worry, Hanekawa.
10|There are many papers in the world I'd refuse to sign,
10|but I'd be willing to put this one down in writing.
10|I see.
10|That's fine, then.
10|To be honest, I wasn't all that worried about it to begin with.
10|It's just, er...
10|Kaiki,
10|do you mind telling me about Oshino's family?
10|He has no such thing.
10|Neither do I.
10|Why do you ask?
10|Well, uh, in that case...
10|Does he have a niece or anything?
10|Niece
10|Scene no. 125
10|Niece?
10|That's quite all of a sudden.
10|Scene no. 127
10|...Oshino has a brother or sister?
10|Scene no. 127
10|What gave her that idea?
10|Scene no. 127
10|He has no brothers or sisters.
10|None.
10|It's not like he lost the family he once had,
10|left his home, or anything of the sort.
10|He just never had any family in the first place.
10|By the way, come to think of it, there was such a story in the middle of the conversation.
10|Scene no. 148
10|Oh right, Kaiki.
10|I heard from Araragi that there's a forbidden closet in Sengoku's room.
10|Nobody knows what's in there.
10|To add to that, it's a closet that she even told her beloved Bro not to open.
10|On the topic of trespassing,
10|Scene no. 149
10|I had no idea something like that existed.
10|A closet, eh?
10|I didn't notice it at all.
10|I kept it a secret.
10|Scene no. 153
10|I see.
10|I wonder what's inside. What do you think?
10|No idea,
10|but if she's going to such great lengths to keep it hidden,
10|it's probably something really important.
10|It's not.
10|That nonsense is of no use whatsoever.
10|I nearly blurted that out, only to stop myself at the very last second.
10|How strange.
10|I wonder why I felt like telling her that.
10|Black
10|Unnumbered Scene
10|Absolute nonsense.
10|My memories are still beautiful despite a sheet of frozen tears,
10|Lovestory
10|and I don't remember why I shed them
10|Now the winter winds of yesteryear
10|turn back the clock for us
10|A misunderstanding, a moment's hesitation
10|Cliched sentimentalism
10|The perfect moment, lost forever
10|Once more
10|Never again
10|I remain young
10|and trusting
10|with my unspoken love
10|a numbing memory
10|Once more
10|Never again
10|I never gave an answer,
10|which pains me,
10|but I remain beautiful
10|and leave behind
10|the warmth of your skin

10|Scene no. 160
10|All that happened in the next few days
10|was me visiting the Shrine of the Polar Snake, where the snake god Sengoku Nadeko was.
10|I went to that shrine practically every day —or well, I actually did go every day—
10|to play with her.
10|I played with her even though I was supposed to be paying my respects.
10|That's a rather disrespectful way to put it,
10|but it feels like the most accurate description, so whatever.
10|We sometimes play with other toys, but at the end, we always return to playing with a cat's cradle.
10|Scene no. 179
10|She'd apparently taken a liking to sake,
10|Kurita
10|so once every few days,
10|I took a bottle with me to the shrine.
10|Hanekawa told me that when Oshino was still in town,
10|he used to live at an abandoned cram school.
10|So in the middle of January,
10|I decided to visit the place on a whim.
10|Though, well, the building itself was gone,
10|so I can't say I got any satisfactory results from the visit.
10|However, there was one amusing coincidence.
10|I ran into an acquaintance named Numachi Rouka at that vacant plot of land.
10|She was a kid I first met several years ago in a different town.
10|I didn't know she used to live here.
10|I felt like the information could prove useful someday.
10|Like when I get to know Kanbaru Suruga in the future, for example.
10|And then January came to an end.
10|It was now February.
10|The day of reckoning had come.
10|Scene no. 210
10|1st of February
10|Oh, so today's the day?
10|Yeah, finally this has day come.
10|Will we be okay?
10|I'm starting to get nervous.
10|No need to be nervous.
10|I'll call you tonight.
10|That'll probably be my final report.
10|You should get ready to celebrate with Araragi.
10|Celebrate, eh?
10|Did something happen?
10|Nothing, really.
10|I was just a little saddened when I realized I'd only speak to you once more after this.
10|Senjougahara said something she clearly didn't mean.
10|Scene no. 220
10|I wondered if she thought she could trick me with such a thing,
10|Scene no. 221
10|and I felt somewhat offended. So, I
10|Scene no. 222
10|I feel the same way.
10|Contacting you in secret reminded me of two years ago.
10|I had fun doing this.
10|responded with something I didn't mean. Although, it might have been rather heartless.
10|Scene no. 224
10|Creepy. She's not someone who laughs that much—
10|Scene no. 226
10|No, that was two years ago. She is different now. She's more than a different person.
10|Scene no. 227
10|Of course, I'll probably end up celebrating with Araragi,
10|but Kaiki, I suppose I'll have to thank you in some way.
10|I'll see you one last time.
10|Nah, no need.
10|You've got to be kidding me.
10|Oh, I don't intend this to be a follow-up service here, but Senjougahara...
10|What?
10|I'm going to say this again, just in case.
10|Make sure you set Araragi straight.
10|I don't care if he's busy studying for his entrance exams or whatever,
10|but once I'm done deceiving Sengoku Nadeko,
10|he'd better not take a casual stroll to the Shrine of the Polar Snake in order to see her.
10|That would ruin absolutely everything.
10|That's it.
10|In the end, that's the biggest problem.
10|If I decide to tell him everything,
10|I'll have to tell him about your involvement, too.
10|But if I do that, he might stubbornly go to see her.
10|Isn't he your boyfriend?
10|So if you don't have any better ideas,
10|seriously tell him to endure it for your sake or to choose between you and Sengoku.
10|Take advantage of your relationship to convince him.
10|Look, if I was capable of acting like that, my life wouldn't have turned out this way.
10|That's true. But then, if their lives are on the line,
10|Scene no. 255
10|why can't she force herself to do something so minor?
10|Scene no. 256
10|Actually, it's not a question of whether I can or cannot.
10|Aren't you worried just by yourself?

10|What I mean to say is that Araragi'll see right through it even I somehow pull it off.
10|My acting skills are top-notch,
10|but suddenly giving him an ultimatum would obviously seem unnatural.
10|I bet.
10|Don't make it sudden, then.
10|Just like how I used the whole of January to curry favor with Sengoku Nadeko,
10|you use the whole of February to do the same with Araragi.
10|Curry favor?
10|Do you see interpersonal relationships as nothing but bargaining tables?
10|I've never done that in my entire life.
10|Either way, there's no more time limit.
10|If you wish to save Sengoku Nadeko,
10|you can still do so once you're in college.
10|Hey, Senjougahara.
10|Mind if I ask you something?
10|What is it?
10|What do you like about Araragi?
10|That he's not you.
10|But then if that's the case, even though it's a process of elimination, the selection criteria for her lover revolves around me.
10|Scene no. 275
10|That he is who he is.
10|If he weren't himself, I don't think I would've fallen for him.
10|I don't really get it.
10|You're passionately in love now,
10|so much so that you're willing to sacrifice your life for his sake,
10|but I bet the two of you will just break up one day once you're in college.
10|I'll let that slide.
10|I'm not impulsive enough to turn everything upside down at this stage.
10|Could you tell me why you had to be so mean, though?
10|Why am I saying such mean things to a high school kid? I feel ashamed of myself.
10|Scene no. 291
10|Anyway, congrats.
10|Both you and your beloved Araragi get to live on. Aren't you glad?
10|It's a bit early for that.
10|Or do you just have that much faith in yourself?
10|If things go badly today, they might as well have gone badly from the get-go, you know.
10|Don't tell me you think you've already succeeded.
10|I do.
10|Rest assured, everything will be resolved by the time you get back from school.
10|I see. Then...
10|Uh, I think saying this after you succeed—
10|after you finish the job and save me, that is—would be in bad taste,
10|so I'm going to get it out of the way now.
10|What is it?
10|Don't get too conceited just because you saved me.
10|You'll still have my gratitude, of course.
10|I'll still thank you.
10|If you change your mind and demand more money, I'm also willing to pay that.
10|I'm also willing to do whatever you say.
10|However, don't think I'll forget all about the grudge and the hatred I bear against you.
10|As long as I live, I will continue to resent, despise, and h-hate you.
10|Sure.
10|Why is his girl saying such obvious things? Is it something worth saying in a formal manner like that?
10|Scene no. 311
10|I don't get her. I really don't get her.
10|Scene no. 311
10|Come to think if it, she did say things like this two years ago too.
10|Scene no. 311
10|Our deal is still in place, by the way.
10|Once this case is closed, never set foot in my town again.
10|Never show up in front of me or Araragi again.
10|Central Ticket Barrier
10|Relax. I have never broken a promise in my life.
10|Purple

10|I suppose.
10|Be it now or in the past,

10|Unnumbered Scene
10|What do you want now?
10|I thought Gaen and I were through.
10|Well, Gaen's the one who's through with you.
10|Not me.
10|The fact that you're my Brother Kaiki will not change.
10|Drop it, seriously.
10|Call me Kaiki.
10|Got it.
10|So you really do intend to defy Gaen, huh?
10|I thought you'd change your mind at the last moment.
10|I was hoping you would.
10|Aren't you here on Gaen's orders?
10|No, I'm not.
10|I'm on my way to hang out at Devil Boy's place.
10|Devil Boy
10|Scene no. 333
10|I'm going to have him pamper me.
10|So running into you here was merely coincidence.
10|A coincidence? The world sure works in mysterious ways.
10|Yeah, it sure does.
10|It is a complete mystery.
10|Three million yen.
10|I think that's too cheap a remuneration for going up against Gaen.
10|Even if Gaen didn't mean for this to happen,
10|you're going to have a lot of trouble surviving in this business now.
10|I never thought it was easy to survive in this world.
10|Though I've considered my own life worthless on multiple occasions.
10|It's not like Gaen doesn't have forces opposing her.
10|I'll just have to pull through by deceiving them somehow.
10|Is she that important to you?
10|Another man's girlfriend, I mean.
10|Another man's girlfriend,
10|and your ex-girlfriend.
10|You seem to be under some sort of misunderstanding.
10|I don't feel like correcting you, though.
10|It's better to leave other people's misunderstandings alone,
10|Scene no. 363
10|even if it's the misunderstanding of an oddity.
10|Scene no. 363
10|This isn't like you, Kaiki.
10|Nothing good ever comes from acting unlike yourself.
10|Surely you've experienced that kind of failure before.
10|Oh, but I guess it's not all that unlike you.
10|Was it two years ago?
10|Was that when you scammed and crushed a rather major cult?

10|Thank you for your cooperation
10|You did that for Senjougahara too, right?
10|I'm talking about the evil religious cult that her mother was in—trapped in.
10|Next train
10|Canceled Canceled
10|You crushed it for her even though it didn't make you much money, right?
10|Though that only led to her mother joining an even bigger cult.
10|It didn't resolve anything.
10|That's an interest take on things.
10|All I did was mess with them
10|for trying to snatch away the opportunity I chanced upon to make some pocket change.
10|Timetable
10|Well, it's true that I didn't make much money out of it.
10|You're free to believe what you want.
10|I don't lose anything by being considered such a nice guy.
10|That was a massive failure as a job.
10|And you'll fail once again this time.
10|That's what Gaen's really worried about.
10|It's not about some unfamiliar town that has nothing to do with her.
10|Gaen's worried about you—your physical and mental well-being.
10|She's afraid you'll do something quite unlike you again.
10|I can't say I like her acting like she cares about me.
10|Didn't you break up the Senjougahara family—
10|forced them into a situation where they had to divorce—
10|because that was the only choice you had left?
10|Wasn't it because you realized that their daughter wouldn't have a future unless her mother went away?
10|Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
10|I'm actually a really nice guy.
10|I'm the sort of kind-hearted guy capable of feeling that way.
10|I'm just playing the bad guy.
10|You're a smart one.
10|I'm impressed you know me that well.
10|Black

10|Don't tell anyone, though.
10|It's too embarrassing.
10|That was a failure too.
10|You didn't understand the feelings of a girl who cared for her mother.
10|Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
10|I really didn't get it back then, did I?
10|I need to take care not to make the same mistake again.

10|I've got a long life ahead of me. I'll do my best.
10|Are you going to stay that way for the rest of your life?
10|Yeah.
10|This is how I'm going to be for the rest of my life.
10|Are you really aware of what you're doing?
10|Nobody in the whole world is really aware of what they're doing.
10|Do you know why you're talking to me?
10|Do you know why you're telling me all this?
10|I'm sure you don't.
10|I think you have an excellent chance of success.
10|You can probably deceive Sengoku Nadeko like taking candy from a baby.
10|If you think about it normally, that's what will happen.
10|But at times like these,
10|Red
10|Unnumbered Scene
10|you will definitely fail—
10|you've always failed.
10|That's probably what Gaen thinks.
10|Well, that's all I had to say.
10|I see.
10|Scene no. 409
10|When I first met Senjougahara Hitagi—
10|it was two years ago—
10|I thought of her as a fragile kid.
10|That still hasn't changed.
10|"Seems Fragile"
10|Scene no. 413
10|I thought she was frail and fragile.
10|That's why I think of her as a miracle now.
10|Dedicate
10|Not a strange disease, but a miracle—
10|Scene no. 414
10|The fact that such a fragile human being didn't break two years ago,
10|isn't broken now, and has lasted eighteen whole years is a complete miracle.
10|The mother broke,
10|but the daughter didn't.
10|I don't know what's going to happen in the future,
10|but what I do know is that she won't be broken right now.
10|Because right now, I'm going to deceive Sengoku Nadeko.
10|It's me, Nadeko?!
10|Yay! Ten thousand yen!
10|Ten thousand yen!
10|Oh yeah, Kaiki.
10|Don't you think it's about time you told me?
10|What's the wish you're trying to make come true by making these hundred visits?
10|Oh, that wish.
10|Shrine of the Polar Snake
10|I haven't been a god for long,
10|so I don't know if I can properly grant your wish,
10|but go ahead and try me!
10|Won't a wish not come true if you tell someone?
10|Huh? What do you mean?
10|When you go on New Year's shrine visits, for example,
10|you're not supposed to tell others what you wished for.
10|They say they won't come true if you do.
10|Wait, why do wishes not come true if you tell others about them?
10|Isn't it because words aren't trustworthy?
10|The moment you speak something, it gets disconnected from your feelings.
10|Words are all lies. They're a sham.
10|No matter how true something is, it gets dramatized the moment you speak of it.
10|If you have to truly wish for something,
10|if you truly want to just wish for something,
10|you should never put that wish into words.
10|Huh? But...
10|Then I won't be able to grant your wish because I won't know what it is.
10|Besides, I've put countless wishes into words all my life!
10|She took the bait.

10|I said it over and over again!
10|That's right.
10|That's why...
10|That's exactly why your wish won't come true.
10|You kept talking about that wish,
10|so it can't come true anymore.
10|What do you mean?
10|I have no choice but to tell you today.
10|I have no choice but to let you know today.
10|You said you wanted to kill Araragi Koyomi, Senjougahara Hitagi, and Oshino Shinobu,
10|but last night, they got into a traffic accident...
10|and died.
10|So, you're trying to deceive me too?
10|I'm sure
10|that even if all my wishes were to come true
10|I'd come to desire something else
10|and come to regret it in turn
10|My love and the time I lacked
10|will be my path into the future
10|There's someone I love
10|There's someone I love,
10|and we haven't even managed to accept the fact

11|And so, I finally got a firm grasp of all the small things that happened...
11|...in that town over the past few months.
11|After listening to Hanekawa, at least...
11|...I was able to objectively grasp the situation better than listening to Senjougahara.
11|I found out how Sengoku Nadeko became a god...

11|...and the damage that resulted from it.

11|Furthermore, what Gaen-senpai... What Gaen Izuko did in that town.
11|To think that she dragged that half-vampire Episode into all this...

11|It's really one huge mess.
11|Hmm...
11|How to put it...
11|After hearing all the stories,
11|...it doesn't seem like Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade's arrival...
11|...was what threw that town into spiritual chaos.
11|It seems more correct to say that...
11|...because that town was in spiritual chaos, Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade was drawn there.
11|At least, Gaen-san didn't say so directly, but it seems she was thinking that way.
11|That's why she wanted to place a new deity over at North Shirahebi Shrine.
11|Since Araragi-kun flat-out refused,
11|...a god was created out of an innocent junior high school girl, I guess.
11|An innocent junior high school girl, huh?
11|What is it?
11|No, nothing.
11|By the way, have you had contact with Sengoku Nadeko?
11|If so, what kind of impression did she leave on you?
11|Timid, shy, afraid of strangers, well-behaved...
11|...were certainly not my impressions of her.
11|The impression I got from her was "someone was snubbed."
11|Someone was snubbed?
11|Like her classmates were ignoring her or something like that?
11|No, that's not it. I was the one getting snubbed.
11|Myself... And everyone else.
11|That girl's world is completely closed off.
11|No matter what anyone says, their words never reach her.
11|Oshino-san had been rather concerned about her as well.
11|But in the end, none of that reached her.
11|It seems this is something I can say at this point in time...
11|It seems she's saying she's in love with Araragi-kun.
11|It seems that's why she's planning on killing Araragi-kun and Senjougahara-san.
11|But...
11|In reality, I don't think she's in love with anyone.
11|She's not looking at anyone else.
11|I somehow want to save her as well, but...
11|Don't expect me to, though.
11|The request I was given was only to deceive Sengoku Nadeko.
11|I know that. This is just me being selfish.
11|However, if by saying you want to save Sengoku Nadeko...
11|...you mean you want to return her to being human, think it over well, Hanekawa.
11|I don't think you've talked to Nadeko since she became a god...
11|...but she seems very happy right now.
11|Someone saying that they are happy doesn't necessarily mean that they are happy, right?
11|Is that so?
11|Yes. At least I think so.
11|Well, if you want to think that way, you can.
11|And after I deceive her, you can save her.
11|1008
11|Huh? Isn't that increasing the difficulty of my job?
11|I was planning on my vagabond way of life right after I graduated...
11|...but things aren't going quite as I planned.
11|Hmm...
11|This may perhaps sound rather rude, but Kaiki-san...
11|What? In the situation we're in, nothing is going to be rude.
11|Do you think you can properly deceive that girl?
11|That's a weird way to put it...
11|I told Senjougahara this too, but it's easy to deceive that girl.
11|Don't worry, Hanekawa.
11|I'm the type of guy that never stamps any sort of paperwork...
11|...but that one request gets my seal of approval.
11|Okay... Then that's fine.
11|No, to tell you the truth, it's not that I'm worried about the deceit itself.
11|But... You know...
11|Kaiki-san, can you tell me a little bit about Oshino-san's family?
11|That guy doesn't have any family.
11|I don't have a family either. What's wrong with that?
11|No, well then, um...
11|For example, a niece...
11|Or someone like that?
11|A niece?
11|He doesn't have any brothers or sisters. None.
11|It's not that he lost a family that used to exist. It wasn't like they left home or anything.
11|He was just born to be all alone in this world.
11|Oh, that's right, Kaiki-san.
11|Araragi-kun told me that in Sengoku-chan's room there is supposedly a "closet that remains closed."
11|A closet that nobody knows what's inside...
11|One that Sengoku-chan told even her "loving big brother" to "never, ever open."
11|There was such a thing?
11|A closet, huh? I didn't notice.
11|I see.
11|I wonder what was inside.
11|I don't know. But if she's trying so hard to keep it a secret...
11|...maybe something very valuable was hidden inside.
11|That's not true. It's something so insignificant that it won't do any good.
11|I almost blurted that. I was very close, but I was able to hold my ground.
11|It's weird. Why did I almost say it?
11|Such an insignificant thing.

11|From there on, for a while, I spent lackluster days...
11|...where I did nothing but commute to North Shirahebi Shrine where Sengoku Nadeko, the Snake God, resided.
11|I basically went every day, or rather...
11|...I really did go to North Shirahebi Shrine every day to play with Sengoku Nadeko.
11|It was a shrine visit, but I played with her.
11|That makes it sound very insolent...
11|...but saying so seems to be most accurate in my mind, so I can't help it.
11|Also, Sengoku Nadeko seems to have grown fond of Japanese sake.
11|Kurita
11|So once every few days...
11|...I brought a one-sho bottle of sake to the shrine.
11|Hanekawa mentioned that when Oshino resided in town,
11|there was a cram school he used as lodging,
11|so I decided to visit that place on a whim sometime in mid-January.
11|Of course, the building itself no longer existed,
11|so to that end, I can't say that I was too satisfied with the result.
11|But, there was an amusing coincidence.
11|I happened to come across an acquaintance. A girl named Numachi Rouka.
11|I met the child several years ago in a different town.
11|To think she was now a resident of this town...
11|That was information that may come in handy someday.
11|For instance, in the future, when I become acquainted with Kanbaru Suruga.
11|And so, January comes to a close. It is now February. It is the day of the plan.
11|1st of February
11|I see. Then it's finally going to happen today.
11|Yeah, finally. That's how it is.
11|Will it be all right? This does make me nervous, after all.
11|Don't be nervous.
11|I'll call you tonight. That will be my last report to you.
11|After that, get ready to drink a toast with Araragi.
11|A toast, huh...
11|Did something happen?
11|No, it's nothing...
11|But, Kaiki...
11|When I consider that this is my second to last conversation with you, I do feel a bit lonely.
11|That's how I feel too.
11|To get in close contact with you like this made me remember two years ago. It was rather fun.
11|Of course. I think I will have a toast with Araragi.
11|But, Kaiki, perhaps I need to give you something in thanks.
11|You want to meet me one last time?
11|No, there's no need for that. Quit with the bad jokes.
11|Oh, this isn't like an after-care follow-up, but Senjougahara...
11|What?
11|I'm going to repeat myself just in case, but you...
11|...have to give careful instructions to Araragi.
11|I don't know if he's busy with exams and all...
11|...but even if I deceive Sengoku Nadeko...
11|...if he then shamelessly heads over to North Shirahebi Shrine to see Nadeko...
11|At that point, everything will have been for nothing.
11|That's just it.
11|That's the problem in the end. If I tell him everything honestly...
11|...I have to tell him about how you were involved in this.
11|If I do, Araragi-kun will be more stubborn than anything and head over to see Sengoku Nadeko.
11|He's your lover, right?
11|So, if you have no other means...
11|...tell him something like "This isn't a joke. Please bear with it for me."
11|Or "Who is more important to you, me or Sengoku-chan?" Fawn over him like that and convince him.
11|I'm telling you, if I could say something like that, my life wouldn't have turned out this way.
11|No, it's not a matter of whether I can or not.
11|Aren't you worried just by yourself?

11|Even if I could, I'm just saying that Araragi-kun will see through it.
11|I'm a good actress, but if I said something like that out of the blue, it's obviously unnatural.
11|That's true... Then, you don't have to say it up front or anything.
11|Just like how I used all of January to get on Sengoku Nadeko's good side...
11|...you can use all of February to get on Araragi's good side.
11|Get on his good side?
11|For you, interpersonal relationships are just bargaining.
11|I've never bargained once.
11|Well, for now, you no longer have a time limit.
11|If you, by chance, want to save Sengoku Nadeko...
11|...it's not too late to do so after you two enter college.
11|Hey, Senjougahara, can I ask you something?
11|What?
11|What do you like about Araragi?
11|The part that isn't you.
11|Because he's Araragi-kun.
11|If Araragi-kun wasn't Araragi-kun, I don't think I would have fallen in love with him.
11|I don't follow that well.
11|Right now, you're all worked up and passionate...
11|...so much that you're able to sacrifice your own life for Araragi.
11|But, in the end, when both of you enter college, you guys might just break up.
11|Well, I'll brush that aside for you.
11|I'm enough of a calculating woman to not pull all of my past out right now.
11|Though, can you tell me why you said such mean things?
11|In any case, congratulations.
11|I'm glad that both you and your loving Araragi are able to survive.
11|You really are hasty. Or is it more that you're very confident?
11|If things don't go well today, it's the same as if it didn't go well from the start.
11|Do you believe everything has already materialized?
11|I believe.
11|No need to worry.
11|By the time you come home from school, everything will have been resolved.
11|I see. Well then...
11|Well, to say something like this after you succeed...
11|In other words, after your job ends with a success... After you save me, it would make me feel bad...
11|So I'm going to say it in advance.
11|What?
11|Just because you saved me doesn't mean you can be full of yourself.
11|No, I will appreciate everything, of course. I'll say my thanks.
11|And if you change your mind and request additional fees, I plan on paying them.
11|I'll do whatever you say, but...
11|Just don't think that this will erase past grudges and ill will that I harbor.
11|I'll hold my grudge against you for the rest of my life. Keep holding the grudge.
11|I-I'm going to keep hating you.
11|Huh?
11|Animation Number 311
11|Why is she saying something that's so obvious? Is she going out of her way to speak ceremoniously like that?
11|I can't understand her. I really can't understand this girl.
11|Animation Number 311
11|If i think it over again, there was a person who had a handbag like that 2 years ago.
11|The promise is valid too. After this case is over, never enter my town for the rest of your life.
11|I want you to never show your face before me... before me and Araragi-kun.
11|Central Ticket Barrier
11|Don't worry. I've never broken a promise.
11|That's right.
11|Neither past nor present, you have never once lied to me.
11|Yeah!
11|What do you want now? I thought Gaen-senpai severed all ties with me.
11|No, only Gaen-san severed her ties with you. Not me.
11|To me, the fact that Kaiki-oniichan is an onii-chan is unwavering.
11|Can't you waver there?
11|Call me Kaiki.
11|Fine.
11|So, that means you really are going to go against Gaen-san's will.
11|I thought that you might plan to invert that resolution at the eleventh hour.
11|I had been hoping for it.
11|Gaen-senpai didn't tell you to come here?
11|Hmm? Not so.
11|I'm just going to go visit devil boy's place.
11|He's going to pamper me. So it's coincidence that I'm here next to you like this, Kaiki.
11|To think there is such a coincidence... The world is a mysterious place.
11|Yup. Mysterious. It's all red and mysterious.
11|3,000,000 yen.
11|I think that's too cheap a reward for going up against Gaen-san...
11|Even if Gaen-san didn't have the will to do so...
11|...it will be hard for you to live within this industry from now on.
11|I've never once thought that this world was an easy place to live in.
11|Though, I've thought my life was nice and cheap several times in the past.
11|It's not that Gaen-senpai lacks a force opposing her either.
11|I'll fool them as I see fit and bear with it for a while.
11|Is someone else's girlfriend that important to you?
11|Someone else's girlfriend... And your old relationship.
11|It seems you have something of a misunderstanding.
11|Though, I don't feel like fixing it.
11|This isn't like you, Kaiki.
11|You do things that aren't you, and you really will be in a bad situation.
11|It's not like you haven't expressed such failures before...
11|Oh, but it's not like this isn't like you either.
11|Was it about two years ago? When you swindled a pretty big religious cult and crushed it down?
11|It was not direct, but I was helping that project too, so I remember it.

11|That was for Senjougahara as well, right?
11|Don't stop on near the escalator!!
11|Thank you for your cooperation
11|It was that evil cult that the girl's mother fell for, or rather, was framed into.
11|Next train
11|Canceled Canceled
11|It didn't make you much money at all, but you chose to crush it for her, right?
11|Well, in the end, that girl's mother merely moved on to another cult that's higher-ranked,
11|so it solved absolutely nothing.
11|You have an interesting view of things.
11|It was a tip for passing by. I merely harassed a religious group I noticed was trying to take a cut of my profits.
11|Timetable
11|But well, it's also true that it didn't net all that much money, so I don't care what you think of it.
11|I'm not going to be at a loss because you think I'm such a good guy.
11|That thing was a failure as a job.
11|And aren't you going to fail again this time? That's what Gaen-san is really worried about.
11|Not about an unknown town that she has no ties or connections to...
11|Gaen-san is worried about your well-being. Your body and soul...
11|That Kaiki might do something unfitting for him again.
11|I don't like it when a senpai like that tries to act so patronizingly.
11|The reason why you ruined the Senjougahara family...
11|...you drove them to a point where they had to get a divorce because that was the only option left, right?
11|Wasn't it because you concluded that unless you cut the mother out,
11|their only daughter no longer had a future?
11|Yeah, that's right. You're correct. I was actually a really good guy.
11|I was actually a kind-hearted soul who thought about kids like that.
11|I was only playing the bad guy.
11|You sure know a lot. How'd you know all that?
11|But don't tell anyone. Because it embarrasses me.
11|That was a failure as well. You didn't understand the feelings of the daughter pining for her mother.
11|Yup, yup, that's right. Man, I totally didn't understand all that way back then!
11|I should be careful not to repeat the same errors.
11|Yup. Life is still long. I'm going to continue doing my best.
11|Are you really like that all your life?
11|That's right. My personality has been like this all my life.
11|Maybe you yourself really don't actually know what you're doing?
11|Is there anyone out there that knows what they're doing in their own mind?
11|Like you... Why are you having this conversation with me?
11|Why are you telling me such? Maybe you don't know?
11|I think the success rate is pretty high.
11|I'm sure that you can easily deceive Sengoku Nadeko, Kaiki.
11|With an ordinary train of thought, that's how it goes. But in times like this...
11|...you always fail. You have.
11|At the least, I think Gaen-san thinks that way.
11|That's about all I can tell you.
11|I see.
11|When I first met Senjougahara Hitagi... In other words, two years ago...
11|...I thought she was a pretty fragile-looking kid.
11|That image hasn't changed to this day.
11|Fragile, and in critical condition.
11|That's why I think how she is today is a miracle.
11|Dedicate
11|For such a fragile person to survive two years ago, now, and the past 18 years without crumbling...
11|The mother crumbled.
11|But the daughter didn't crumble...
11|I don't know what's going to happen from here...
11|...but at the least, right now, she will not crumble this instant.
11|Because I'm going to deceive Sengoku Nadeko.
11|Here's Nadeko!
11|Yay! Ten thousand yen! Ten thousand yen!
11|That's right! Kaiki-san!
11|It's been a while, so can you tell me soon?
11|The wish you want me to grant with your hundred visits!
11|Oh, my wish...
11|North Shira hebi Shrine
11|I just turned into a god, so I'm not sure if I can do it properly.
11|But Kaiki-san, you should at least tell me what your wish is!
11|A wish can be something that can never come true the moment you tell someone else about it.
11|Huh? What do you mean?
11|When you go to the first visit of the year, you're not supposed to tell other people what you wished for.
11|They say your wish won't come true if you voice it.
11|Why is it that if you tell someone else, your wish won't come true anymore?
11|Because you can't trust words, of course.
11|The moment you put it into words and tell someone, it starts to diverge from your feelings.
11|Words are nothing but lies and nothing but cheats.
11|No matter what the truth, the moment it is told, it becomes dramatized.
11|If you... If you wish for it to be as is...
11|If you just want to wish for it...
11|That wish can never be spoken out loud.
11|Huh? But...
11|Then I don't know what your wish is at all, Kaiki-san, so I can't grant it for you...
11|Besides, until today, I've talked a lot about my wishes already.
11|Like how I want Koyomi-oniichan, his girlfriend, and his slave dead...
11|I've been saying it all this time.
11|Right. That's why...
11|That's why that wish won't come true.
11|Because you kept talking about such a wish...
11|...you can no longer grant that wish.
11|What do you mean?
11|That's what I have to tell you today.
11|That's what I have to teach you today.
11|Araragi Koyomi, the one you've been wanting to kill...
11|...and Senjougahara Hitagi and Oshino Shinobu too...
11|...got into a traffic accident last night and died.
11|So Kaiki-san, you're going to deceive me as well.
11|kitto ne kiri ga nai koto
11|I'm sure that after
11|zenbu kanatta ato mo
11|we have been granted an infinite amount of wishes

11|That's one more.
11|Taking care of an important request.
11|If it's an intellectual contest, you're definitely gonna lose.

11|The right answer is Nadeko-chan. Why is that? Because she was cute enough to make the cut!
11|We're the Fire Sisters!!
11|Looks like I made it in time once more.
11|You got some nerve saying that now.

12|My work was perfect.
12|Scene no. 1
12|I'm quite confident I can say that.
12|Scene no. 1
12|Knowing that any blunder could easily spell the end,
12|Scene no. 1
12|I ascended the steps to this shrine,
12|and for this very day
12|Scene no. 1
12|I took utmost precautions.
12|Scene no. 1
12|And yet
12|Scene no. 1
12|The fact that Sengoku Nadeko saw through my lies so easily
12|meant that she hadn't placed any trust in me at all.
12|So I never stood a chance of deceiving her to begin with.
12|With that in mind,
12|Scene no. 14
12|you could say I was deceived by her.
12|Scene no. 14
12|But no
12|Scene no. 14
12|I should've taken her mental issues more seriously.
12|I didn't think she'd closed her heart off to this extent.
12|This wasn't some darkness she held within her heart. It was just a heart of darkness.
12|She has no interest in anyone.
12|For an entire month
12|Scene no. 14
12|I was convinced I could create some amount of trust
12|Scene no. 14
12|with Cat's Cradle, donations, and sake.
12|Scene no. 14
12|I thought I'd won Sengoku Nadeko's trust.
12|Scene no. 14
12|I was nothing but an enormous fool.
12|Scene no. 14
12|Seriously, you're such a liar.
12|Every last one of you is so full of lies.

12|Beautiful.
12|So
12|Scene no. 49
12|I thought.
12|Scene no. 49
12|My memories are still beautiful despite a sheet of frozen tears,
12|Lovestory
12|and I don't remember why I shed them
12|Now the winter winds of yesteryear
12|turn back the clock for us
12|A misunderstanding, a moment's hesitation
12|Cliched sentimentalism
12|The perfect moment, lost forever
12|Once more
12|Never again
12|I remain young
12|and trusting
12|with my unspoken love
12|a numbing memory
12|Once more
12|Never again
12|I never gave an answer,
12|which pains me,
12|but I remain beautiful
12|and leave behind

12|So full of lies...
12|So full of lies!
12|Society, the world, and this entire universe...
12|is so, so, so, so, so, so...
12|full of lies, lies, lies, lies, and more lies!
12|You're all such liars.
12|Huh? Who do you think you're talking to?
12|And what do you think you're talking about?
12|Sounds like you believe you've never once uttered a lie.
12|That's rich, coming from someone who kept deceiving the people around her.
12|If I'm a liar, you're the bigger one.
12|Scene no. 70
12|You can't grant anyone's wishes.
12|You only think of yourself.
12|Scene no. 83
12|You only trust yourself.
12|Scene no. 83
12|You seem to be under the mistaken belief that you're special just because you've become a god.

12|They said they hated me.
12|It's like I didn't say anything at all.
12|Scene no. 90
12|She lives in her own world.
12|Scene no. 90
12|That they hated cute brats like me.
12|Er, who was it that said that, again?
12|Who was it, again?
12|Was it Koyomi?
12|It was Senjougahara.
12|Scene no. 94
12|I just know.
12|Scene no. 94
12|But what am I supposed to do about that?
12|Sure, I am a cute brat,
12|but that's not really my fault, is it?
12|I hate myself too.
12|But this is me—this is who I am—so what can I do?
12|No matter what I may be like, this is still who I am, so what else can I do but like myself?
12|I have to turn this hatred for myself into love.
12|I have to love myself no matter what I'm like.
12|That's the kind of god I have to be.
12|That's—
12|That's not right.
12|In the end,
12|to this very day,
12|even after you've become a god,
12|you're just like you used to be—
12|just like you used to be back when you were human—
12|you're just being strung along by others.
12|Just like you used to be idolized for being cute,
12|now you're being idolized for being a god.
12|You're a puppet. You've always been.
12|This one woman I knew was different.
12|She rejected god's offer of salvation.
12|She refused to make things easier for herself—she rejected happiness.
12|I used to think she was fine that way.
12|She chose to live her life refusing to rely on God until the bitter end.
12|No, she wished for it.
12|She could've blamed coincidences, chance meetings, something, or someone,
12|but she rejected all such convenient options.
12|I looked out for her a bunch of times, but she actually resents me now.
12|You and her are worlds apart, right?
12|They'd never synch.
12|Scene no. 121
12|Right. We very well may be worlds apart.
12|I don't know who you're talking about, or how you feel saying all this,
12|but, you know,
12|there are times in reality when someone else is to blame.
12|Whether it was by chance or because of our meeting,
12|Ougi is definitely to blame for what happened to me.
12|Ougi?
12|Hold on.
12|Scene no. 130
12|What?
12|Scene no. 130
12|Is that a name?
12|Scene no. 130
12|Come to think of it, there was something I didn't understand.
12|Why did she know the location of the "god's core" that Gaen had entrusted Araragi with?
12|Don't tell me, did someone lead her there?
12|Did someone willfully turn Sengoku Nadeko into a god?
12|So, you're trying to deceive me too?
12|Scene no. 137
12|"You too."
12|Does that mean someone out there tried to deceive her?
12|Who was it that refused to fawn on her and tricked her into becoming a god?
12|Ougi?
12|Scene no. 140
12|Not like I care, though.
12|Wait, I guess I do care a little.
12|Resistance is fine, but Koyomi shouldn't have tried to deceive me.
12|He shouldn't have lied to me.
12|Araragi had nothing to do with my actions.
12|This is a penalty.
12|I'll keep my promise.
12|I'll still wait until the graduation ceremony.
12|But I'll kill a bit more.
12|As punishment, I'll kill a bit more...
12|friends and family.
12|Scene no. 151
12|right in front of Koyomi's eyes!
12|I have to include Tsukihi and Karen, of course.
12|Oh, Hanekawa too.
12|And though I've never met her before,
12|I'll reserve a spot for the girl Koyomi's most friendly with, Hachikuji Mayoi.
12|And as much as I hate to do this—I really hate doing this—Kanbaru, too.
12|Sengoku.
12|You said that you didn't want to be a god, right?
12|I did.
12|That you didn't become one because you wanted to.
12|I did. What of it?
12|In that case...
12|Do you want to be a manga artist?
12|Scene no. 149
12|How did you know?
12|How did you know?!
12|Why do you know?
12|Why do you know?!
12|Did you... s-see it?!
12|Red
12|Unnumbered Scene
12|You saw it, didn't you?!
12|Yeah, I did.
12|I saw it.
12|I put a 10 yen coin inside and turned the lock.
12|Money really is important, isn't it?
12|I said that it wasn't supposed to be opened!
12|I didn't even want Koyomi to see that!
12|You're really good at drawing.
12|Not to mention, that story was amazing.
12|What was with that hypocritical, diabetes-inducing romcom?
12|What is this, the 80's?
12|As if a guy like that could exist in the real world.
12|Ridiculous.
12|To top it all off, the developments in it were rather lewd.
12|I was overwhelmed by how much research you'd put into the premise, too.
12|But well, I think you went overboard.
12|I think it'd appeal to a lot more people if you streamlined it a bit more.
12|Y-You're dead.
12|Dead! Dead! Dead!
12|I'll kill you and then kill myself!
12|Kill, huh?
12|Scene no. 248
12|So you finally
12|Scene no. 248
12|give me the time of day.
12|Scene no. 248
12|Killing me won't achieve anything.
12|Did the thought never come to you?
12|Sure, your parents may dote on you with everything they've got,
12|but if you stay missing for much longer,
12|they'll eventually open that closet of yours.
12|Though, well, if you quit being a god right now, turn back into a human, and go back to your room,
12|you might be able to easily dispose of that stuff yourself.
12|If people seeing it embarrasses you that much—
12|Screw you!
12|As if I could quit being a god for such a stupid reason!
12|"For such a stupid reason," eh?
12|Then... what would be... reason enough... for you to quit being a god?
12|No matter who I spoke to—
12|Senjougahara, Hanekawa, and even your own parents—
12|they never knew you had such a hobby.
12|That's how tightly you kept that embarrassing work a secret.
12|You didn't tell anyone.
12|Wasn't it because that was your real dream?
12|Dream
12|Scene no. 274
12|When one truly wishes for something, they don't tell people about it—not even God.
12|I bet you're happy as a god.
12|I bet you're having fun.
12|But you didn't want to become a god, right?
12|Even waiting for six months has you so bored that you got hooked on cat's cradle,
12|so what on earth will you do after you've killed Araragi and friends?
12|Happy as you may be, you're nothing but a guard who has to watch this shrine rot away with time.
12|How unfortunate.
12|It's not like you wanted to become a god, or wanted to be happy.
12|You wanted to become a manga artist, right?
12|Then why don't you?
12|A-Are you stupid?
12|Those are just doodles.
12|I only don't want people to see them because of how embarrassingly bad they are.
12|My dream?
12|Don't be ridiculous!
12|They're just trash!
12|I only hid them because I was too ashamed to throw them away, as much as I wanted to!
12|Don't speak of your own creations like that, Sengoku.
12|Literary creations are inherently embarrassing.
12|Dreams aren't much different.
12|Nothing can be done about it.
12|It is what it is.
12|But at the very least, you're not supposed to deride them yourself.
12|You're so good at it, too.
12|Maybe you're just, as they say, a natural.
12|Of course not!
12|Besides, a manga artist isn't something you can become just by having the desire.
12|But if you don't even have the desire, you'll never become one!
12|It's not like how you're happy just because you're a god.
12|Being a god also prevents you from becoming one.
12|So you have to be human.
12|Sengoku, I love money!
12|You know why?
12|Because money can replace everything.
12|It lets you buy things.
12|It lets you buy lives.
12|It lets you buy people.
12|It lets you buy hearts.
12|Dreams
12|Happiness
12|Love
12|Happiness
12|It lets you buy happiness.

12|I love money because it's so important, and yet not irreplaceable.

12|"I can't live without this."
12|"That's the only reason I'm alive."
12|"That's my only purpose in life."
12|Things that have scarcity value like that piss me off the most.
12|Does being rejected by Araragi make you completely worthless?
12|Does that ruin everything you wanted to do?
12|Is that all your life amounted to?
12|Hey, Sengoku...
12|There's a fool out there who's saying she'll take the tiresome role of being Araragi's girlfriend.
12|So put an end to that tiresome desire of yours, and do something else that's equally as tiresome.
12|Don't you have plenty of other things that you wanted, or wanted to do?
12|Didn't you?
12|Am I wrong?
12|Things that I want? Things I want to do?
12|Hey, Sengoku.
12|Did you consider everything except Araragi worthless?
12|Did you not love those upstanding citizens you called your parents?
12|In your priorities, is everything except Araragi trash?
12|No.
12|Then, why?
12|Why do you give him special treatment?
12|Is he another part of yourself or something?
12|Don't act like you understand everything!
12|You don't know anything about me.
12|I did my research.
12|But you're right.
12|I don't know a thing.
12|I don't know about anything that matters.
12|You're the only one who knows everything about yourself.
12|So you're the only one who can truly value yourself.
12|And you're the only one who can make your dreams come true.
12|That's so fickle...
12|Turning your attention to something else just because one thing didn't work out.
12|Is it really okay for humans to be like that?
12|It is. We're only human, after all.
12|Nothing in this world is irreplaceable.
12|The girl I know—
12|the girl I know well—
12|acts like the love she's in at any given moment is her first love.
12|It's like she's always in the moment where she truly fell in love for the first time.
12|And that's how it's supposed to be.
12|It shouldn't be any other way.
12|"The only one" doesn't exist. Everything can be replaced.
12|Humans, because they're only human, can always start over from scratch.
12|They can always buy something new.
12|For now...
12|take the money I gave you and go buy some proper drawing tools.
12|Look, I don't really...
12|I've never thought about becoming a manga artist.
12|And while I never wanted to be a god,
12|I was lucky enough to become one.
12|I think throwing that away would be a waste.
12|But...
12|There was a manga artist people called "God," wasn't there?
12|I could just be like him, right?
12|Yeah, I'm sure you'll be able to pull it off.
12|Give it a shot, thinking I deceived you into it.
12|Fine.
12|I'll let you deceive me.
12|This cheeky brat.
12|That said,
12|Scene no. 375
12|although the plan didn't quite work out as expected,

12|Sengoku.
12|Kaiki?
12|Kaiki?!
12|What are you doing here?!
12|What did you do to Sengoku?!
12|I'm here on behalf of Gaen.
12|I was in the middle of exorcising this girl.
12|This time, I'm working not as a scamster,
12|but as a ghostbuster, basically.
12|I broke the rules by coming to this town, but I didn't do so as a scamster, so it should be okay.
12|Of course I came to deceive, it's how I live and breathe.
12|Scene no. 390
12|Well, outside of the last five minutes just now.
12|Scene no. 390
12|Gaen?
12|B-But what exactly did you do to Sengoku?
12|The same thing I did to your little sister.
12|The same thing you did to Karen?
12|Right.
12|Though it wasn't a bee this time.
12|For Sengoku Nadeko, I used a slug instead.
12|Though both are terrestrial molluscs, unlike snails, slugs are often considered stereotypically disgusting
12|Scene no. 394
12|Slug
12|A Slug Tofu.
12|Of course, it's not an oddity powerful enough to seal a snake god.
12|As per usual, it's a hastily put together, fake oddity.
12|If Sengoku Nadeko wasn't ready to accept a sluggishly-living slug, this wouldn't have worked.
12|Ready to accept?
12|Wait, Kaiki! What the hell did you tell her?
12|The obvious.
12|I merely stated the obvious.
12|Like how love isn't everything,
12|there are other things to look forward to,
12|don't throw your future away,
12|everyone's lived embarrassing teenage lives,
12|and how all of this will turn into a fond memory in due time.
12|I merely stated such obvious things, like what an adult would normally tell a kid.
12|So if you ask me what I did,
12|I'll have to say I merely did the obvious.
12|Hey!
12|Kaiki, what are you doing?!
12|Shut up and stay out of this, Araragi!
12|Realize this:
12|There's nothing you can do for Sengoku.
12|Is this the talisman Gaen entrusted to you?
12|Huh? Yeah, that's right.
12|I see.
12|Here.
12|Don't get it wrong this time.
12|Use it on the right person.
12|I won't.
12|I won't use this thing.
12|Hey, wait!
12|Where do you think you're going, Kaiki?!
12|Do you even need to ask?
12|I'm not supposed to be in this town.
12|If she finds out I'm here, Senjougahara will kill me.
12|My job is done.
12|Scene no. 443
12|Got quite a bit of money.
12|Scene no. 443
12|Be sure to take her home, Araragi.
12|The Slug Tofu will go away by itself in three days or so.
12|You don't have to worry about what happens after that either.
12|If it doesn't go away, then put some salt on her or something.
12|And after that, never associate with that girl ever again, okay?
12|Hurry up and become just a memory.
12|I can't be that irresponsible!
12|It's my fault Sengoku ended up like this.
12|I have to make amends—
12|Don't you get it?
12|You can't do anything for her.
12|With you around, she'll only grow weaker.
12|Love can give people strength, but there are times when it leaves them worse off.
12|Senjougahara grew stronger because of you,
12|but Sengoku Nadeko will only grow weaker with you around.
12|Senjougahara grew weaker because of me,
12|but you gave her strength.
12|So, as kind of the right person for the job,
12|I returned the favor to you.
12|Kaiki...
12|Will Sengoku become happy as long as I'm not around?
12|Beats me.
12|She seemed happy enough earlier.
12|But it's not like becoming happy is a human's only purpose in life.
12|Even if she doesn't become happy,
12|she can just become whatever she wants to.
12|Though, well, all said and done,
12|good things should eventually happen to her as long as she's alive, don't you think?
12|Bye. Let us meet again.
12|Scene no. 459
12|Well, I covered it up the least I could.
12|The rest I leave to you.
12|This old warrior will take his leave.
12|It's now your time to shine, kids.
12|Stop trying to act cool after you messed everything up.
12|And still, at the end,
12|Scene no. 459
12|Thank you very much.
12|You're a lifesaver.
12|that's what she said again.
12|Scene no. 461
12|So I guess this is goodbye?
12|Yeah.
12|We're through now. The End.
12|Bye-bye.
12|Later.
12|Hey, Kaiki. Can I ask you something?
12|No.
12|It's about two years ago.
12|Do you really believe that I was in love with you?
12|Like I freaking care.
12|Scene no. 461-2
12|Yeah, that's what I thought.
12|That so?
12|Well, you've been completely deceived by me.
12|I guess.
12|And what of it?
12|Nothing. That's all I had to say.
12|Make sure to be wary of evil women from now on.
12|All right.
12|And you make sure you don't forget your signature when you send out letters.
12|Red
12|Unnumbered Scene
12|It's not a big deal.
12|The one behind that note in my hotel room
12|was indeed Senjougahara Hitagi,
12|but seeing through it is not a praiseworthy feat by any means.
12|—It wasn't hard to figure out,
12|Scene no. 471
12|but it took some time.
12|Scene no. 471
12|As for why she contradicted herself by first asking me to take up a job and then telling me to back off,
12|she did it because she knows me well.
12|My character makes me lose all desire to back off when told to do so,
12|and Senjougahara was well aware of that.
12|That aside...
12|Senjougahara aside,
12|I wonder how much of this was part of Gaen's plans.
12|My character makes me lose all desire to back off when told to do so,
12|and she knows that even better than Senjougahara does.
12|Could it be that she paid me three million yen as some kind of financial aid?
12|Could it be that I was merely being strung along by that woman?
12|Still, I think.
12|What in the world is Oshino up to at this crucial time?
12|Would that busybody—
12|the guy who tries to act cool around the kids—
12|really not show up in this situation?
12|Where is he, and what is he doing right now?
12|O-Ougi was right.
12|You actually had come back, you damn scamster!
12|Because of you...
12|Right.
12|He's one of the many middle schoolers I scammed the last time I was in this town.
12|What's with this guy?
12|Did his curse come back to bite him?
12|Then this kid might be the root cause of everything—
12|the middle schooler who put a curse on Sengoku Nadeko.
12|Black
12|Unnumbered Scene
12|Come to think of it, I never did figure out who the person following me was.
12|I thought it could perhaps have been Senjougahara or Gaen's observer,
12|Scene no. 505
12|but if this was the outcome that Gaen had hoped for,
12|Scene no. 505
12|there would be no meaning to this.
12|Scene no. 505

12|No, it was not.
12|I judge with a bloodied head.
12|Scene no. 507
12|I don't think he's sane enough to be able to tail people.
12|Wait, didn't he mention a name just now?
12|Ougi. Who's that supposed to be?
12|It felt like I'd heard that name before,
12|but I was in no state to think anymore.

12|They say even your place in Hell can change depending on money.
12|I didn't have any savings,
12|so I was glad to have earned some pocket change right at the end.
12|I felt that way from the bottom of my heart.

13|My work was perfect.

13|I'm quite confident I can say that.

13|Animation Number 1
13|I ascended the steps to this shrine,

13|I took utmost precautions.
13|Animation Number 1
13|And yet
13|Animation Number 1
13|With that in mind,
13|Animation Number 14
13|you could say I was deceived by her.
13|Animation Number 14
13|But no
13|Animation Number 14
13|For an entire month
13|Animation Number 14
13|I was convinced I could create some amount of trust
13|Animation Number 14
13|with Cat's Cradle, donations, and sake.
13|Animation Number 14
13|I thought I'd won Sengoku Nadeko's trust.
13|Animation Number 14
13|I was nothing but an enormous fool.
13|Animation Number 14
13|So
13|Animation Number 49
13|I thought.

13|If I'm a liar, you're the bigger one.

13|What?

13|Is that a name?

13|Sengoku Nadeko so easily saw through my lies...
13|...because she never trusted me one bit to begin with.
13|So there was nothing to deceive in the first place.
13|I should have put more emphasis on the problems of her heart.
13|I didn't think that this girl had closed her heart to this extent.
13|It wasn't a shadow within a soul. It was a soul made of shadows.
13|She snubs everyone.
13|Really now, you liar...
13|Everyone... Everyone really does nothing but lie.

13|Really, so full of lies.
13|Really, so full of lies!
13|In the world, this universe, this world...
13|Really, really, really, really, really, really...
13|Lies, lies, lies, lies, full of lies!
13|You really are a liar!
13|Hah, who do you think you're talking to? And what are you talking about?
13|You make it sound like you've never told one lie in your entire life.
13|But you've been deceiving everyone around you this whole time.
13|It's impossible for you to grant the wishes of someone else.
13|Did "becoming a god" give you the false idea that you are someone special?
13|She said she hated me.
13|She said she hated "cute brats" like me.
13|Let's see... Who said that...
13|Who was it... Was it Koyomi-oniichan?
13|But about that... What should I do?
13|It's true that I'm a "cute brat," but is any part of that really my fault?
13|I hate being like this as well.
13|But this is who I am... This is me, so I can't do anything about it.
13|But still... Even if I feel like that, it's who I am.
13|So I have to love myself.
13|I have to love myself, who I hate so much.
13|I need to become like a god, so that I can love myself no matter how I am.
13|That's...
13|That's not true.
13|In the end, even now, even after becoming a god...
13|Just like before... Just like back when you were human...
13|...your environment swings you around every which way.
13|Just like how everyone praised you like "cute, cute," they just praise you like "god, god."
13|You're nothing but a doll, past and present.
13|That's where some woman I knew was different.
13|She refused an offer for a god to save her.
13|She rejected taking it easy and being happy.
13|I had thought that staying that way would be better for her.
13|But she persistently chose a way of life that didn't rely on gods. That's what she wished for.
13|The outcome, the result of first contact, someone's or something's fault...
13|She denied everything that put her at ease.
13|After all the thought I put into her, she repaid the kindness with resentment.
13|Hey, aren't you and her totally different?
13|You're right. That's totally different.
13|Though I don't know who you're talking about and with what feelings.
13|But...
13|But the reality is it's someone's fault, isn't it?
13|Whether it's something right off the bat or something I stumbled upon...
13|...in my case, it's an absolute that it's Ougi's fault.
13|Ougi?
13|Come to think of it, there was something I didn't understand.
13|How did she know the location of "the essence of god" that Gaen-senpai loaned, or rather entrusted with Araragi?
13|Can it be that there was someone who encouraged her to look somewhere?
13|Someone who set Sengoku Nadeko up to become a god?
13|Kaiki-san "as well."
13|That means there was someone that tried to deceive Nadeko sometime, somewhere.
13|The person who deceived Sengoku Nadeko, instead of saying she was cute, encouraged her to become a god...
13|Was that Ougi?
13|Well... In the end, it doesn't matter.
13|No, wait, it does matter. I can't do anything to resist myself.
13|But, Koyomi-oniichan, it's not nice to try to deceive me.
13|It's not nice to lie to me.
13|Araragi really has nothing to do with my actions.
13|Oh! This calls for a penalty.
13|I'll keep my promise. I'll wait until your graduation.
13|But I'll kill a few more. I'll kill a few more as your punishment.
13|Right in front of Koyomi-oniichan's eyes!
13|Of course, Tsukihi-chan and Karen-san are a given.
13|And Hanekawa-san...
13|Also, though I've never met her, doesn't Koyomi-oniichan have a best friend named Hachikuji Mayoi-chan?
13|And I kind of don't want to... I really don't want to, but Kanbaru-san too, I suppose.
13|Sengoku, you said that you didn't want to become a god, right?
13|I did. Why?
13|You said you became one against your wishes...
13|I did say that. What's wrong with that?
13|Then do you want to become a manga artist?
13|Why do you know! Why do you know! Why do you know! Why do you know!
13|It can't be!
13|You peeked!
13|You peeked! You peeked! You peeked! You peeked! You peeked!
13|Yeah, I took a look. I peeked in.
13|By twisting the lock open with a 10 yen coin.
13|Money really is a valuable thing.
13|I-I said that nobody should ever open that door!
13|I didn't even want Koyomi-oniichan to see!
13|You're good at drawing.
13|Furthermore, the plot was just amazing...
13|What was with that melt-your-brain opportunistic romantic comedy?
13|Is it something from the 80s? You think a guy like that exists in real life? So absurd.
13|And the plot was pretty perverted, you know.
13|The character reference guide was pretty thick and overwhelming too.
13|But you tried to cram in too many settings.
13|Smarten them up a bit, and they'll suit everyone better.
13|K-Kill!
13|Kill! Kill! Kill! I'll kill you and then kill myself!
13|It's useless to kill me.
13|You never really thought about it?
13|Even the parents that are just doting on you...
13|...will open that closet someday if you continue to be missing.
13|But, if you stop being a god now, become a human, and go back to your room...
13|...you can destroy them all with your own hands with no issues, right?
13|If someone else seeing them is so embarrassing, then...
13|Enough! I can't stop being a god for some foolish reason like that!
13|"A reason like that," huh?
13|Then, let me ask you... What kind of reason would it take for you to stop being a god?
13|No matter who I talked to...
13|I talked to Senjougahara, to Hanekawa, I even talked to your parents...
13|None of them knew that you had a hobby of that sort.
13|You obstinately hid those embarrassing creations from everyone.
13|You didn't tell anyone.
13|In other words, you did that because you consider it to be your true dream, right?
13|Your real wish isn't something you tell others. Not even to god.
13|You must be happy now that you're a god. You must be having fun.
13|But it's not that you wanted to become a god, right?
13|You're so bored that you engross yourself in cat's cradle while waiting a mere six months, you know?
13|After you kill Araragi and the others, what the hell are you going to do?
13|No matter how happy you are, you're only a gatekeeper who will watch things rot away.
13|You drew an unlucky lot.
13|It's not like you wanted to become a god. Not like you wanted to become happy.
13|You wanted to become a manga artist, right? Then why don't you become one?
13|A-Are you an idiot? Those are just scribbles.
13|I didn't want people to see those unskillful, embarrassing drawings.
13|My dream? Don't tell me such foolish things!
13|They're all trash!
13|I wanted to throw them out, but I was too embarrassed. Of course that's the reason I hid them there!
13|Don't talk about what you created like that, Sengoku.
13|Creation is an embarrassing process, and dreams are embarrassing as well.
13|You can't help that. That's something very common.
13|But, at least, it's not something that you should belittle yourself over.
13|Besides, they were pretty good. Maybe you have that thing called talent.
13|There's no way that I do. Besides, I can't become one just by thinking I can be one, right?
13|But if you don't think about becoming one, you'll never become one.
13|Unlike becoming a god or a happy person.
13|Besides, that's something you can't become if you're a god.
13|You have to be human.
13|Sengoku, I like money.
13|I'll tell you why. It's because money can take the place of everything.
13|You can buy things. You can buy lives.
13|You can buy people. You can buy hearts.
13|Dreams
13|Happiness
13|Love
13|Happiness
13|You can buy happiness. You can buy dreams.

13|It's very precious, but on top of that, it's not something that is irreplaceable. That's why I like it.
13|Conversely, I hate irreplaceable things.
13|"I can't live without this." Or "That is the reason why I'm alive."
13|Or "That is the purpose for which I was born."
13|Scarcity value pisses me off to no end.
13|Would you become worthless if Araragi dumped you?
13|Was that the only thing you wanted to become?
13|Is that all your life meant to you?
13|You know what, Sengoku?
13|Some idiot out there is volunteering to do something as sluggish as dating Araragi for you.
13|So you can put an end to something that sluggish and do some other sluggish thing.
13|You have all sorts of other things you want to try, or to do, right?
13|You had some, right? Am I wrong?
13|Something I want to try... Something I want to do...
13|Come on, Sengoku.
13|For you, was everything in this world outside of Araragi so worthless that you didn't care at all?
13|Your parents... You didn't love those ordinary law-abiding citizens at all?
13|In your priorities list, was everything other than Araragi all trash?
13|They weren't...
13|Then why? Why is Araragi the only one to get special treatment?
13|Is he your alter ego or something?
13|What would you know, Kaiki-san!
13|You don't know anything about me, Kaiki-san.
13|I did all sorts of research. But that's right. I don't know anything.
13|I know nothing important.
13|Because only you know about you.
13|That's why you're the only person who can take care of you.
13|And you are the only one who can grant your dream.
13|Are humans allowed to randomly swap around like that?
13|Like, "Since that's bad, let's go with this?"
13|You can. Because you're human.
13|Nothing is irreplaceable. There is nothing that can't be substituted.
13|A woman I know...
13|A woman I know well always treats her current romance as if it's her first.
13|She always looks like she's never fallen in love with someone before.
13|And that's the right way to go. That's how it should be.
13|There is no peerless person. There is nothing irreplaceable.
13|Because humans, as humans, can redo something as much as they want.
13|Re-purchase anything as much as they want.
13|For now...
13|Use the money I gave you to go buy professional art tools or something.
13|I'm telling you... I never really thought about becoming a manga artist. Not even once.
13|And it's true that I didn't want to be one when I became one...
13|...but I think it would be a waste to toss aside being a god, since I had the fortune of becoming one.
13|But...
13|There were people who were called gods of manga, right?
13|If I feel it's a waste, I can become one of those, right?
13|Yeah. I'm sure you can be one.
13|Pretend that you were deceived and try it out as a challenge.
13|All right. I'll let you deceive me.
13|Oh, you...
13|Sengoku...
13|Kaiki?
13|Kaiki! You! Why are you here?
13|What did you do to Sengoku?
13|I was asked by Gaen-senpai.
13|I was exorcising this girl just now.
13|This job wasn't one for a con artist, but for a ghost-buster.
13|Coming to this town was against the rules, but since I'm not here as a con artist, it's fine, right?
13|Gaen-san...
13|B-But... What in the world did you do to Sengoku?
13|The same thing I did to your little sister.
13|The same thing you did to Karen-chan?
13|Right. But this time it's not a bee.
13|For Sengoku... For Sengoku Nadeko, it was a slug.
13|A Slug Tofu.
13|Of course, it's not so strong an apparition that it can seal away a snake god.
13|As always, it's a fabricated, fake apparition.
13|If Sengoku Nadeko herself hadn't been accepting the slippery lifestyle of a slug...
13|...I would've had no chance.
13|Been accepting...
13|Wait, Kaiki, what did you say to Sengoku?
13|I said the obvious.
13|I told her the obvious.
13|Romance isn't everything. There is fun in life.
13|Don't throw your future away. Everyone has had embarrassing adolescences.
13|After a while, everything will be a good memory.
13|Stuff like that... Obvious things that adults tell children.
13|So if asked what I did...
13|I answer I only did the obvious.
13|H-Hey!
13|Kaiki! What are you doing?
13|Shut up and stay back, Araragi!
13|Know your place. There is absolutely nothing that you can do for Sengoku.
13|The talisman that Gaen-senpai entrusted to you... Is this it?
13|Huh? Yeah, it is.
13|I see.
13|Here.
13|Don't make a mistake next time you choose to use this on someone.
13|I won't use it... I'll never use something like this.
13|H-Hey! Wait! Where are you going, Kaiki!
13|Where, you ask? I shouldn't be in this town in the first place.
13|If Senjougahara finds out that I'm loitering around here, she'll kill me.
13|Make sure to take that girl back home, Araragi.
13|The Slug Tofu will naturally depart from her in about three days or so...
13|...so you don't have to worry about the aftereffects.
13|If it's refusing to part with her, toss some salt on her.
13|And after that, make sure that you have no part of that girl's life till the day you die.
13|Got that? Hurry up and become a memory in her mind.
13|I can't do something so irresponsible.
13|It's my fault that Sengoku ended up this way. I have to take responsibility...
13|Don't you get it?
13|There is nothing you can do for that girl.
13|If you're around, that girl will just be useless.
13|Romance can strengthen people, but it can also make them useless.
13|Because you were with her, Senjougahara was able to strengthen herself a bit.
13|But Sengoku Nadeko will just be useless if you're with her.
13|Senjougahara became useless because she was with me.
13|You came in and strengthened her.
13|So this time I was the right guy for the situation, you could say.
13|Something like repaying that old favor.
13|Kaiki...
13|Would Sengoku become happy if I wasn't around?
13|Who knows? She seemed very happy up until moments ago...
13|But then, becoming happy isn't the primary objective of human life.
13|It doesn't matter if she's happy or not as long as she can become what she wants to be.
13|But in any case, if she keeps on living, maybe something good will happen in due time.
13|Well then, I'll see you again.
13|Well, I did the minimum amount of fudging the story, so I'm going to leave you to clean it up.
13|Old soldiers only fade away. What remains is for the children's generation.
13|After creating a huge mess, don't try to show off for no reason...
13|Thank you very much. You saved me.
13|Then, this is goodbye.
13|Right. I'm done with you now. It's the end.
13|Bye-bye.
13|See ya.
13|Hey, Kaiki. Can I ask one thing?
13|You can't.
13|About two years ago, did you really think I was in love with you?
13|At least I thought you did.
13|I see... Then I deceived you just to my liking.
13|I guess. So, what of it?
13|No, that's all.
13|From here on, be careful of bad women.
13|Right.
13|And you, make sure you don't forget to sign the letters that you send.
13|It's really not much.
13|The fact that Senjougahara Hitagi was the author of that letter that was slid into my hotel room...
13|...wasn't something worth complimenting even if I saw through it.
13|Then why, after being the one to make the request, would she say something so contradictory as "pull out"?
13|That is because she knows me very well.
13|It's because Senjougahara Hitagi knows very well that my personality won't want to pull out if told to.
13|But...
13|Senjougahara aside, how calculating was Gaen-senpai in all of this?
13|Since she knows, even more than Senjougahara,
13|that my personality won't want to pull out if told to.
13|In truth, perhaps she only paid me the huge sum of three million yen...
13|...because she intended to help me financially with this job?
13|Maybe I was cleverly manipulated by that woman... By that senpai...
13|But still, I think...
13|What the hell is Oshino doing now of all times?
13|That good-natured man who wants to show off in front of kids hasn't shown up...
13|Can such a thing really happen?
13|Where the hell is he now, and what the hell is he doing there?
13|I-It's just like Ougi-san said.
13|You really were back. You con artist...
13|Because of you...
13|Because of you... Because of you!
13|I see. He's one of the many junior high kids whom I deceived last time I was in this town.
13|What's with this kid? Did he get inflicted with a reversed curse?
13|Then, this junior high kid is...
13|Maybe he's the root of all evil... The junior high kid who enchanted Sengoku with the "charm."
13|Come to think of it, I resolved the letter issue...
13|...but the shadower's identity wasn't exactly resolved yet.
13|Then, was this junior high kid the shadower?
13|No, it wasn't him.
13|I can't think that he has enough sanity to shadow someone else.
13|Wait, didn't he mention some person's name just now?
13|Ougi? Who is that?
13|It was a name that I felt I had heard somewhere before, but I could no longer think anymore.
13|They say money talks even in hell.
13|Since I don't have money saved up, I felt really glad from the bottom of my heart...
13|...that I was able to earn a bit of pocket change at the very end.

13|And they lived happily ever after. With that Monogatari Series Second Season is complete.
13|Eh! You want to be the main character of the series?
13|Makya!
13|Nope, there is something more.
13|What? Are you sure? I'm not aware of it.
13|You just didn't listen. Anway, last Preview Quiz!
13|I might be able to grant that wish...
13|For real?

13|Kanbaru Suruga Main "Hanamonogatari" 2014 Production!
13|Kangusu!
13|No, it's only Kanbaru.
14|Scene no. 1
14|I would rather like to talk about how Kanbaru Suruga is pretty stupid, but I wonder if you would listen to me.
14|Scene no. 2
14|Well, I don't think this story has a point. None at all.
14|In my time, I've come to hate many people, to detest many people?
14|I found a devil inside myself, and made him grow?
14|But still I wondered what others did in their lives.
14|Now I will tell you of my story and hers.
14|Please let me share it.
14|I know that I live stupidly.
14|How
14|do you live, I wonder?
14|Scene no. 2
14|Scene no. 3
14|If you can't be medicine, then turn into poison.
14|Otherwise, you'd just be plain old water.
14|Such words were second nature to my mother.
14|I don't think you can call my mother a good one.
14|Scene no. 8
14|Suruga,
14|you're sure to lead a more troublesome life than others—
14|one that's all too tedious and annoying.
14|I think she was a bit eccentric.
14|Scene no. 11
14|However, I don't say that because you're better than everyone else,
14|but because you are weak.
14|And you'll have to spend your entire life shouldering that weakness.
14|I had an eccentric mother, I think.
14|Scene no. 13
14|I just hope your troubles don't become your raison d'être.
14|Black
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|She was the kind of person who loved throwing people for a loop
14|by spouting incomprehensible words like she knew it all.
14|I feel like, to her, I was just "that little thing over there," and nothing more.
14|Scene no. 17
14|Once she and my father passed away, I was taken in by my paternal grandparents,
14|and to this day, I still don't know what he saw in her.
14|Rather, it's not a question of why he fell in love with her,
14|Scene no. 19
14|but why she went as far as to run away to marry my father.
14|Scene no. 19
14|That reminds me, my father once said, "that girl's standing in for God in this mortal world."
14|Looking back now, the fact that he referred to his wife as "that girl" brings a smile to my face.
14|That said, I find it hard to agree with him.
14|You were already cursed when you turned out to be my daughter.
14|Scene no. 21
14|I can't accept his opinion.
14|If I consider you cute, that's not because I actually want to,
14|Scene no. 27
14|How should I say this?
14|Right. If you ask me,
14|but because I'm forced to by God.
14|Scene no. 28
14|she was more like the devil.
14|Black
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|God and the devil are just two sides of the same coin.
14|Debate this endlessly as we might, humans will always be dancing in the palm of their hands.
14|So stop racking your brain over things that are clear as day...
14|So she said.
14|Scene no. 31
14|My mother.
14|Scene no. 31
14|Kanbaru Tooe—
14|maiden name Gaen Tooe—says to me:
14|...and wake up already, my stupid girl!
14|An exciting new school term begins today!
14|April 9th
14|Oh god...
14|That was the worst wake-up call of all time.
14|Scene no. 42
14|Ever since I unknowingly attacked Araragi in my sleep—
14|ever since I got possessed by a devil—
14|I've been tying myself up with these ridiculous "chains" every night.
14|Being aware of your unconscious destructive impulses must be tough, Suruga.
14|Ignorance is bliss.
14|Scene no. 50
14|Scene no. 65
14|I'm good.
14|Scene no. 77
14|It looks like
14|Scene no. 77
14|I didn't commit any crimes yesterday.
14|Scene no. 77
14|Scene no. 80
14|Need nail clippers...
14|Oh god.
14|Scene no. 85
14|If I start looking for nail clippers now, I'll definitely be late for school.
14|If you really try, you can cut your nails with scissors.
14|Scene no. 95
14|Bad idea.
14|Oh well.
14|"I should just go the whole hog,"
14|is what I think sometimes,
14|but I can't bring myself to make that decision.
14|I must have the tendency to be torn between options.
14|Torn.
14|Scene no. 106
14|Torn.
14|Actually, I'm usually the one doing the tearing,
14|so that might not be the best phrase to describe me.
14|Then I should just cut to the chase and call myself greedy.
14|I am Greed.
14|Scene no. 108
14|I desire everything, only to lose it all.
14|I am Greed, and I love Senjougahara.
14|Scene no. 110
14|I start chasing every rabbit I see and end up catching none of them.
14|That's me, Kanbaru Suruga, and that's just how my life goes.
14|White
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|As proof, I even lost my nail clippers.
14|Though, well, if I used that as leverage to rant against my destiny with my room as messy as it is,
14|Senjougahara and Araragi might get mad at me.
14|That's when it hit me:
14|I'll never be scolded by those two lovable seniors again.
14|Because they're gone.
14|I can still feel their presence, but it's merely an illusion.
14|Scene no. 122
14|Laughing at my inability to move on, I head to school—
14|to a Naoetsu Private High School that has lost Araragi Koyomi and Senjougahara Hitagi.
14|What is this I have stuck inside my heart?
14|It grows so large I have to talk about it
14|In the prison that we call freedom
14|we live half in the past
14|I'm prisoner to your confused response
14|Thinking about all the right and wrong decisions now
14|Now you are gone from this chaotic world
14|My feelings lie buried deep
14|I run alone to where my heart
14|commands me
14|I cut myself lose from the words that tied me down
14|Nobody will equal me
14|in my honesty to myself
14|when I decide
14|to find someone else now

14|The way I put it made it sound like the two of them had died or something,
14|but it's not like that at all.
14|They'd simply graduated high school, is all.
14|They graduated, and I became a third-year.
14|That's all.
14|That's all there is to it.
14|Anyway, today's April the 9th—
14|the day I, Kanbaru Suruga, officially become a third-year.
14|Now I am all alone.
14|Scene no. 138
14|Black
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|Oh, hello, Suruga.
14|Good morning, Ougi, my boy.
14|Wait. "Ougi... my boy"?
14|Weren't you a girl?
14|What are you talking about?
14|I've always been a guy.
14|I popped out of my mother's womb a boy, and not for a second has that ever been untrue.
14|Now that I think back on it, I do seem to recall you being a guy.
14|My bad.
14|I seem to have made a mistake.
14|Nothing wrong with an honest mistake every now and then.
14|Life would be too stifling if we weren't allowed to make any faux pas at all.
14|Speaking of which, you can't spell "past" without the "pas" in "faux pas."
14|Does that mean unequivocally everything in the past was a mistake?
14|That's... not how you use the word "unequivocally."
14|I almost said that out loud,
14|Scene no. 156
14|but refrained from it in time.

14|Now that I think about it, the word "future" goes back to Latin and means "I am not yet."
14|Maybe life just consists entirely of negatives.
14|Oh, no.
14|What's wrong, Suruga?
14|Did all that running hurt you somewhere?
14|A few kilometers won't hurt me. My body's made of stronger stuff.
14|There's something you want to talk to me about, right?
14|You wouldn't call out to me otherwise.
14|Oh?
14|Over-directed
14|Scene no. 167
14|That's awfully cold of you.
14|I was afraid I'd get frostbite.
14|Can't I talk to you without a reason?
14|If I had to choose, I think I'd find it scarier if you did have one.
14|Gee, how warmhearted of you.
14|Red
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|Suruga, have you heard the rumor about the devil?
14|The devil?
14|Scene no. 175
14|Scene no. 176
14|My third-year classroom—
14|the same one Araragi, Senjougahara, and Hanekawa frequented last year.
14|Come on, now.
14|Araragi Koyomi
14|This must be Senjougahara's desk.
14|Morning, Ruga!
14|We finally get to be classmates this year, huh?
14|This is Higasa.
14|A basketball teammate of mine.
14|She was vice-captain last year and took the reins once I retired.
14|Yeah, about time.
14|Let's go home together, Ruga.
14|Sorry, I need to go buy some reference books.
14|I made up a passable excuse.
14|Scene no. 196
14|Lying doesn't bother me.
14|Scene no. 196
14|What? Don't tell me you took what the teacher said earlier about "being a good final-year student" seriously.
14|C'mon, girl. That's "in one ear, out the other" stuff!
14|Not exactly, but yeah.
14|I got a late start, so I need to study harder than your average student.
14|I won't get into college with my current grades.
14|I see.
14|Well, you are pretty stupid.
14|That was blunt.
14|Scene no. 204
14|But how does she know?
14|Scene no. 204
14|That was supposed to be my secret!
14|Scene no. 204
14|See you tomorrow, then.
14|O-Okay.
14|Oh yeah, Higasa.
14|You ever heard of the devil?
14|Oh ho?
14|Why would a positive girl like you be aware of that rumor?
14|Scene no. 213
14|Apparently it's a sort of charm that's all the rage among Naoetsu High students lately.
14|If you talk to the devil about any problems or worries you have,
14|it'll be solved for sure, or so they say.
14|The "for sure" makes it sound extremely fishy,
14|Black
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|but no matter how fishy it might be,
14|we're talking about a devil here— and one that grants wishes, at that.
14|I have to take action.
14|Because, for all we know, I could be the devil myself.
14|Black
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|The rumor says "for sure," but apparently it's not as unconditional.
14|I hear the devil doesn't take up requests that are too extreme.
14|As for what makes something "too extreme,"
14|they say it's cases where you're better off going to the police.
14|The hell?
14|That's awfully particular—or well, pragmatic.
14|At the very least, it's not the kind of condition the devil would have when granting wishes.
14|Of course not.
14|This "devil" we're talking about seems to be a particular, pragmatic human being.
14|Human being?
14|A girl around high school age, apparently.
14|You mean to say some high schooler's pretending to be the devil
14|and accepting requests from students of Naoetsu High?
14|A high school girl?
14|Sounds more and more like me.
14|Well, yeah.
14|But whether she's actually pretending or not is still up in the air.
14|She just might be the real deal.
14|Didn't you say it was a particular, pragmatic human being?
14|Who said a particular, pragmatic human being couldn't be the devil?
14|I mean, she solves your problems for sure.
14|I can't think of her as just some nice girl.
14|Black
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|Well, it's no big deal. Araragi just mentioned something like that in the text he sent me earlier.
14|Araragi?
14|Did Kanbaru just say "Araragi"?
14|What's going on?
14|For real?!
14|Is she text buddies with him?
14|Scene no. 250
14|I've heard rumors about the devil too.
14|Yoohoo!
14|I figured Tsukihi would make her move soon,
14|so I've been secretly recharging my batteries in preparation.
14|The flames of justice take their toll on the Earth too!
14|Unlike what happened last summer break,
14|we haven't heard of anyone being adversely affected by this.
14|That's making it hard for Tsukihi to take action.
14|That said, this person's saying they're the devil and taking requests from people.
14|Just the fact that they came up with the idea makes them abnormal.
14|Isn't there a chance this devil could be the real thing?
14|Naoetsu Private High School
14|Please, Suruga. What are you saying?
14|No way the devil actually exists.
14|I'm in high school now, you know.
14|I don't believe in spirits anymore!
14|Listen to this, Suruga.
14|Scene no. 259
14|My brother is the real shit.
14|Even one as I was taken aback.
14|Anyway, Karen. Here's what I want to know:
14|Do you have any idea how to meet this devil?
14|Well...
14|There are three ways to meet the devil,
14|and if we were to categorize them under "easy," "normal," and "hard,"
14|the simplest way to do so would be to write a letter.
14|If you suddenly can't find the letter where you left it, that means the devil accepted your request.
14|As for how normal mode goes,
14|it's your standard phone call,
14|but there's no way to tell which number to call at any given time.
14|It's also hard to figure out if it's a guy or a girl on the other end.
14|The voice sounds muddled, as though the receiver has a handkerchief draped over it.
14|They don't speak too much, either.
14|Just a "yes" or "no" at the end.
14|Finally, hard mode—
14|and you might've figured this out by now—
14|you meet the devil face-to-face.
14|Of course,
14|Scene no. 282
14|to actually meet the devil,
14|I opted for the last choice.
14|Scene no. 282
14|So where would I have to go to meet them, let's say, today?
14|Well, that changes all the time too,
14|Entry Strictly Prohibited
14|To Mountain Climbers
14|Due to deforestation this mountain forest will be entry prohibited at all times. Any and all trespassers will be
14|Areas Off Limits
14|Western Eastern
14|Objects Falling Take Care
14|Warning Entry Prohibited!
14|This is private property, and entry is strictly prohibited regardless of reason.
14|We will report you to the police on sight to have you arrested!
14|The Management
14|and whether you actually get to meet them there depends on your luck, but right now...
14|Scene no. 291
14|I may have laid out three options,
14|but most people end up going with the very first one.
14|Seven out of every ten people send their requests to the devil by letter.
14|I'd say two of the remaining three call.
14|And the last one comes to see you in person,
14|I take it?
14|Nah. The last one gives up when faced with the third option.
14|Out of every ten people, the one that'd go so far as to bring their problems directly to the devil would be the eleventh.
14|And well, they very likely have serious issues,
14|so I end up referring them to the police, a lawyer, or a child welfare center.
14|So far, only two people have come to see the devil face-to-face,
14|and both of them ended up taking those measures.
14|That said,
14|you seem to be different,
14|Kanbaru Suruga.
14|That's right,
14|Numachi Rouka.
14|Numachi Rouka
14|Scene no. 313
14|It makes me happy to see you still remember me.
14|Numachi Rouka:
14|a basketball player from another school in this area who I faced multiple times on the court back in junior high.
14|So much so that it'd be better to call us arch-enemies than rivals.
14|I don't remember ever having lost, but I never truly won, either.
14|Scene no. 321
14|I was an offensive slasher,
14|whereas Numachi was a slippery lockdown defender.
14|That left arm of yours, Kanbaru...
14|So the rumors about it being made of glass were true.
14|Looks like we're in the same boat, then.
14|Why do star players have to be so susceptible to injury?
14|In our last junior high tournament,
14|Scene no. 333
14|Numachi badly hurt her left leg during a match right before she would've faced us.
14|She was forced to retire.
14|Scene no. 333
14|I threw my entrance exams away to rehab, you see.
14|So now I'm a part-timer living in the moment.
14|But it's hard to find employment with my leg in this state,
14|so I'm more unemployed than a part-timer, really.
14|And that's why I can be the devil.
14|You know what they say about idle hands.
14|So you playing devil is a job replacement since you can't get one with that injured leg?
14|Huh?
14|You've got it all wrong.
14|While I certainly am acting as the devil right now,
14|it's not like I'm making any money off of it.
14|I do it all for free.
14|For free? She solves problems without charging any money?
14|That sounds almost like...
14|Almost like Araragi.
14|Scene no. 346
14|If you're not in it for the money, why are you doing this?
14|Do I have to give you an explanation?
14|Yeah.
14|I guess I can.
14|This devil business was done for the moment an amateur sleuth like you found me.
14|It's been three years since I retired from basketball in junior high.
14|I've spent that entire time lending a helpful ear to people with problems—
14|by hook, crook, and every trick in the book.
14|Er, you wanted to know why I'm doing this?
14|"If I'm not in it for the money, then what for," was it?
14|Yeah. That's what I asked you.
14|To help people and make this world a better place, of course.
14|Blue
14|Unnumbered Scene
14|Just kidding.
14|I do it for me.
14|Purely for the benefit of myself, Numachi Rouka.
14|I guess you could say it's all for this left leg.
14|By listening to people with problems and concerns,
14|I get to meet many others as unhappy as me, and some even worse off.
14|I get to sigh in relief that I'm not the only one.
14|I play the devil for that, and that alone.
14|Oops. Didn't take you long to scorn me.
14|You're straight as an arrow.
14|The letters that you high schoolers send to me—the devil—
14|and all those phone conversations I recorded are my most prized possessions.
14|I've spent the three years since I put up shop collecting the misfortune of others.
14|Collection
14|Scene no. 362
14|I can't say that's in very good taste.
14|Don't get so worked up, Kanbaru.
14|You look like you're coming to punch the daylights out of me.
14|Don't close in like that.
14|You're too intimidating, honestly.
14|You used to get much closer when boxing me out.
14|Beats me.
14|It's all in the past now. I've forgotten about it.
14|I'm no basketball player now.
14|Just your friendly neighborhood counselor.
14|I told you not to get so worked up, Kanbaru.
14|You know, do you really think everyone who comes to me for help has serious issues?
14|All I get is trivial crap.
14|I refer the people who actually need help to the appropriate legal authority.
14|Didn't I say that earlier?
14|I don't go around making things worse, either.
14|I just lend them a helping ear.
14|Who am I hurting with that?
14|I may be laughing at them on the inside, but the look on my face is the very picture of sincere.
14|You're betraying them the moment you "laugh at them on the inside."
14|Though I guess saying that is useless.
14|It is, yeah.
14|And Numachi, I know what your response will be.
14|"Apart from the stuff that's clearly out of my league, I do my job and solve all of their problems for them.
14|You have no right to mouth off at me," right?
14|Nah.
14|I don't really do anything.
14|Like I said, I just listen to them.
14|I give them a shoulder to cry on and then do nothing.
14|When they pick option one, I take their letters and then do nothing.
14|When they pick option two, I tell them I'm on it over the phone and that's the end of it.
14|And when they pick option three, I get the gist of it and, without prying into the details—
14|again, without doing anything—
14|put them on the conveyor belt to the appropriate legal recourse.
14|She doesn't like stories that are too painful, either.
14|Scene no. 378
14|The devil only listens to you, nothing more.
14|But then why does rumor say the devil solves your problems for sure?
14|You don't do anything, right?
14|Oh, come on.
14|That's obviously because, in most cases, time heals all wounds.
14|When it comes down to it, worries are basically anxieties about one's future.
14|So all they really need are the words "I'll take care of it,"
14|and not the actual solving of the problem itself.
14|But isn't that just escapism?
14|Isn't that just running away?
14|Aren't you just making your clients avert their eyes from their problems?
14|And what exactly is wrong with escapism?
14|A vast majority of this world's problems can be solved by running away.
14|While you're running away and putting off the matter at hand, your problems cease to be problems.
14|It's because people try to solve their issues right then and there that they go through so much pain.
14|What if, back then—
14|back when I made a deal with a real devil—
14|I hadn't tried to face my problems, but just grinned and bore it?
14|I probably wouldn't have hurt anyone.
14|And despite what she says, and despite how she says it,
14|Numachi Rouka has lent a helpful ear to many a high schooler as the devil,
14|and she has put them at ease.
14|That seems to be the undeniable truth.
14|Get your hand off me.
14|I told you to get your hand off my chest.
14|So?
14|What now, Kanbaru?
14|I'll leave.
14|What you're doing isn't the least bit admirable.
14|And your thought process?
14|I don't understand how you think at all.
14|But it doesn't look like you're actively making people unhappy.
14|Taken purely at face value, you're actually helping them out.
14|I'm glad you understand.
14|I don't!
14|See you later, Kanbaru.
14|It's too bad that our long-awaited reunion turned out like this.
14|I really wanted it to happen on the court,
14|but I guess that's one wish that'll never be granted for either of us.
14|Reality can be so cruel.
14|That's also a wound that time will heal, right?
14|Precisely.
14|Anyway, I'm satisfied with how things turned out.
14|I'm not the devil indiscriminately taking requests from high schoolers.
14|Figuring that out is more than enough.
14|Will there ever come a day when I can sleep without tying my left arm up with packing tape?
14|Oh.

14|People look smart when they put on a serious face and rack their brains,
14|but they've got it all wrong.
14|Giving things thought isn't always the best option.
14|Those who nonchalantly take things as they come are the ones that really have the world in their hands.
14|Worrying is a waste of time.
14|If you've got the time to think, you've got the time to act.
14|Forget your problems.

14|April 10th
14|My left arm wasn't the monkey's paw.
14|It wasn't the devil's arm, either.
14|It'd gone back to what it was supposed to be: a left-sided human arm.
14|I'd never lose it
14|It will always gnaw at my heart
14|Is there anything that you can offer me
14|in return for my admiration years ago?
14|A twisted light brings us back together
14|and suddenly my loneliness is lit up
14|On the waterside I see the summer haze
14|One day it will be gone like the flowers
14|I'm afflicted by incurable sadness
14|I made up an excuse to keep others at bay
14|I'd like to plant a faint kiss of goodbye on that
14|and be someone who turns around to face you in the crowd
14|Before everything grows faint and dim,
14|I want to find use for my pain
15|Scene no. 1
15|How?
15|Why has my left arm been freed from its curse?
15|Why today? Why so suddenly?
15|That reminds me,
15|Oshino did say it was a problem that'd be solved with time.
15|Did it just take longer than expected?
15|Wait. There's one other possibility.
15|My hatred for Araragi was the whole reason my arm turned into the monkey's paw to begin with.
15|Tamikura-sou
15|I hated him so much I wished he was gone.
15|It was because my wish never came true, and because the whole thing never got closure,
15|that it was still the devil's arm.
15|And now it's back to normal.
15|Does that mean...
15|You sissy!
15|Judging from this text, I get the feeling that Araragi is perfectly fine.
15|Looks like I don't have to call him post-haste.
15|More like, I don't wanna.
15|But if nothing's happened to Araragi,
15|then why has my arm gone back to normal?
15|What is this I have stuck inside my heart?
15|It grows so large I have to talk about it
15|In the prison that we call freedom
15|we live half in the past
15|I'm prisoner to your confused response
15|Thinking about all the right and wrong decisions now
15|Now you are gone from this chaotic world
15|My feelings lie buried deep
15|I run alone to where my heart
15|commands me
15|I cut myself lose from the words that tied me down
15|Nobody will equal me
15|in my honesty to myself
15|when I decide
15|to find someone else now

15|I can't keep my balance!
15|Ow...
15|This arm really does belong to me.
15|It's my left arm—it's got blood flowing through its veins, nerves passing through, and it does my bidding.
15|It's the same left arm that dribbled the basketball and acted as my support over the years.
15|Man, that hurts.
15|Ow... Ouch...
15|It hurts.

15|This is weird.

15|I mean, I've never seen you walking before.
15|What's wrong?
15|Did you hurt your leg or something?
15|Nah. Nothing of the sort.
15|That time of the month, then?
15|I'd call you rude, but I think you just don't know where to draw the line.
15|Oh, shoot. I forgot I was a guy right now.

15|I wonder why she quit.
15|There must be so many people thankful for her help.
15|People can't help each other.
15|Sounds like something my uncle would say.
15|But this is the devil we're talking about.
15|Yeah, right.
15|Devils don't exist.
15|It's impossible to be a human being and a devil at the same time.
15|A devilish human is as close as you can get.
15|Scene no. 102
15|No idea.
15|Numachi, right?
15|The girl that harassed you on D and made it feel like you were running on quicksand?
15|The Numachi Rouka, nicknamed the "Poisonous Swamp"?
15|Poisonous Swamp
15|Scene no. 123
15|I had no idea she went by such a moniker.
15|By the way, people used to call you "Godspeed Angel" Kanbaru.

15|I think the "Tryhard Suruga" of my invention is still more popular.
15|Scene no. 127
15|Either way, I dunno.
15|I mean, I heard she transferred out of that junior high powerhouse right after she retired.
15|Really?
15|Yeah. She was apparently on a sports scholarship,
15|which she lost due to the injury, meaning she couldn't afford to go there anymore.
15|I think her whole family moved at the time,
15|so you probably can't find her around here anymore.
15|We basically know nothing about her whereabouts, then.
15|Yup.
15|If you really have to know, I could go through an old friend and ask her former teammates.
15|Thanks, but don't worry about it.
15|You don't have to go that far.
15|Scene no. 155
15|April 15th
15|I found out that Numachi's whereabouts were a mystery on Tuesday.
15|Five days later, on Sunday,
15|I took a train outside the town I called home.
15|Later.
15|We finally meet,
15|legacy of Gaen.
15|Kaiki... Deishuu...
15|Oh?
15|You know who I am?
15|I see. You must've heard from Araragi or Senjougahara.
15|That's convenient.
15|I guess the moral of the story for me here
15|is that you never know when and how interpersonal relationships will come in handy.
15|Hang on a second, legacy of Gaen.
15|I was waiting for—
15|Don't just break into a sprint. You could hurt yourself.
15|Seriously, don't break into a sprint when you're off the track.
15|Such a tomboy.
15|Be careful or you'll fall.
15|I lost.
15|To this scamster. At my best skill.
15|He left me eating dust, no room for excuses.
15|Shameful.
15|Scene no. 190
15|Kill me now.
15|Can the world please end?
15|Scene no. 190
15|You're hopeless.
15|And you call yourself Gaen's daughter?
15|Wow. Your face is a mess.
15|Don't run away, now.
15|Like I said, I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
15|But I haven't been able to since Senjougahara and Araragi banished me from your town.
15|So I've been waiting for you to set foot outside ever since last summer.
15|You've been waiting for me?
15|That's right... or not. Just kidding.
15|What's wrong? Follow me.
15|Araragi and Senjougahara told me to escape without talking to you if I ever ran into you.
15|Oh, so that's why you broke into a sprint earlier.
15|I see you have very caring seniors.
15|On the other hand, you could say they didn't care enough to consider a scenario where you couldn't escape from me.
15|The moral of the story for you here
15|is that some things can't be solved by simply running away.
15|There are things that can't be solved by simply running away.
15|In the same vein, there are wounds that time can't heal.
15|Relax.
15|I'm not going to deceive or use you.
15|I just want to talk to you,
15|legacy of Gaen.
15|It's not the kind of conversation that's meant to be had in front of a crowded station,
15|so I'm saying we should go sit down at a nearby cafe, is all.
15|Normally this would be rarer than an earth-shattering event, but you—and this day—
15|are an exception.
15|I don't mind buying you a cup of tea.
15|Fine. I'll go.
15|Are you happy now?
15|Scene no. 230
15|I have a reservation. My name's Kaiki.
15|Damn this man. First he talks about tea and now he's feeding me meat.
15|Scene no. 233
15|Go on. Eat some meat.
15|There's no need to order veggies at a chophouse.
15|If that's what you want, go to a salad bar.
15|Don't worry. I'll chop them up nice and good for you.
15|Dammit.
15|Why am I seeing him in a positive light?
15|Eat all the meat you can while you're young.
15|Meat is all a person needs to be happy,
15|legacy of Gaen.
15|Well, regardless of whether you're young or old, life is never free of worries.
15|But good meat can make them all go away.
15|Stop that. Don't be nice to me.
15|You're my admirable seniors' arch-enemy,
15|so stop making it hard for me to detest you.
15|I'd like you to stop calling me "legacy of Gaen" or whatever. It's too weird.
15|I suppose you're right.
15|But I'd rather die than call you Kanbaru.
15|It's not Gaen's surname, you see.
15|That leaves "Suruga," but is that okay with you?
15|It's better than "legacy of Gaen," at least.
15|Very well.
15|Okay, Suruga. Hurry up and dig in.
15|Meat tastes best hot.
15|Thanks for the food.
15|Oh?
15|So you're right-handed, huh?
15|Gaen was a southpaw.
15|Wait.
15|Could it be that you're forced to use your right hand because your left's injured?
15|Any other type of meat you'd like to try?
15|I don't know anymore.
15|He's acting like the typical rude-yet-nice relative.
15|Give me a break.
15|Do things that'd let me hate you.
15|What exactly do you want?
15|Didn't you say you wanted to talk to me about something?
15|I suppose I did.
15|I did, indeed.
15|You might've figured it out by now, but I knew your mother.
15|And, uh...
15|Actually, didn't you meet your aunt last August?
15|You know, Gaen Izuko?
15|No.
15|She introduced herself to me with a different name.
15|I only found out she was a Gaen after she left town.
15|Is that so?
15|Sounds like her, all right.
15|I don't get along too well with Izuko,
15|but your mother helped me out plenty in the past.
15|I got to know her by chance when I was younger than you are now.
15|That relationship lasted all the way until my college days.
15|I guess you could call her my tutor of sorts.
15|And I accepted a request from her:
15|"If anything happens to me, look out for my daughter."
15|She asked you to do that?
15|I didn't find out she'd passed away until recently.
15|That's when I heard the daughter she left behind had been taken in by her paternal grandparents.
15|Is that why you came to our town last year?
15|You've got it the wrong way round.
15|You were secondary.
15|It's not like Gaen paid me or anything,
15|so there's no reason for me to go that far.
15|I just figured I'd take a quick look at you while I was there.
15|Were you in love with my mother, by any chance?
15|This is why I can't stand you kids.
15|You see everything through romance-tinted glasses.
15|Well, you call her Gaen.
15|But if we go by what you just said, she should've already changed her name to Kanbaru by the time she met you.
15|Doesn't that mean you refuse to come to terms with her marriage?
15|In your eyes, Kanbaru's the name of the man who stole your love from you.
15|Laughable.
15|But I like how perceptive you are.
15|Well, you're mostly spot-on.
15|Back when I was in college, I saw your mother as the woman of my dreams.
15|She was one fine lady.
15|But I had a girlfriend at the time,
15|so nothing happened between us.
15|Rest assured.
15|They're all just memories now.
15|Memories that aren't worth a single cent.
15|Do I resemble my mother?
15|Don't ask me.
15|That was more than fifteen years ago.
15|If I had to choose, then you probably do resemble her. You're mother and child, after all.
15|But frankly speaking, I barely even remember her face.
15|So you forgot what the woman of your dreams looked like?
15|Yeah, I'm cold like that.
15|Either way, Suruga,
15|I'm glad to see you, Gaen's legacy, doing well.
15|Even your left arm's not really injured, is it?
15|Oops.
15|Ghostbuster
15|Kaiki Deishuu
15|What's that?
15|Unlikely as it may be, call me if you ever need any help.
15|I did promise her I'd look out for you.
15|You want to scam me?
15|Like you did Senjougahara?
15|No. You, I won't scam.
15|You seem to have a lot of respect for your seniors.
15|If you don't stay wary of me and hate me at all times—
15|if you don't keep rejecting everything I stand for—
15|you feel like you're betraying them, don't you?
15|But you're wasting your time.
15|I won't scam you,
15|and I don't intend to harm you in any way whatsoever,
15|so you won't come to hate me.
15|Just like how love isn't always requited,
15|hating someone doesn't mean they'll hate you in turn.
15|Sometimes, they won't even let you hate them in peace.
15|People aren't comic book characters, you know.
15|No human being is made completely of malice.
15|Nobody is evil through and through.
15|No character looks the same from all angles,
15|and hell, no character stays consistent at all times.
15|You seem to take pride in your running, but it's not like you run all the time, right?
15|You also walk and sleep.
15|The same goes for me.
15|I love money, but I can also spend it.
15|And I can be nice to people even when I'm not particularly attached to them.
15|Call if I ever need any help, huh?
15|Yeah.
15|I can scam most people for you.
15|When you put it that way, it makes me not want to call.
15|But well, it's the thought that counts.
15|What's wrong? You've stopped eating the meat.
15|Meat, meat!
15|Meat all the way!
15|Beef.
15|Pork.
15|Chicken.
15|Beef.
15|Liver.
15|That's the order.
15|You're a little too slender.
15|Stuff your face with meat and fill out a bit.
15|Scene no. 373
15|Well, if you can get by without relying on me, then you're better off that way.
15|Nothing wrong with that.
15|But relying on me is better than turning to the monkey's paw.
15|Your mother entrusted you with the mummified monkey's paw, right?
15|I'll warn you just in case: never use it.
15|You're bound to run into a connoisseur before long. Let them have it.
15|A connoisseur?
15|Yeah. A collector, so to speak.
15|Someone's trying to gather all of the devil's body parts.
15|They'll probably try to take the monkey's paw from you.
15|I'm not trying to be mean,
15|but if they show up, then shut your mouth and hand it over.
15|Sure.
15|Got it.
15|I just have to hand over the paw my mother gave me if I see this collector, right?
15|Now, then.
15|It looks like staring at my gloomy face is making you lose your appetite.
15|I'll be leaving now, so take your time and enjoy yourself.
15|And order a couple more plates of meat.
15|Eat more meat.
15|Meat, okay?
15|Bye.
15|H-Hang on—
15|Er, uh...
15|Spit it out.
15|What, did you fall for me?
15|How'd you know I'd show up at that station today?
15|How'd you manage to lie in wait for me there?
15|Because I heard from your friend that you would.
15|My friend?
15|Who, Higasa?
15|Higasa?
15|That's not what the kid was called.
15|Numachi...
15|Numachi Rouka.
15|Yeah. I think that was it.
15|I'd never lose it
15|It will always gnaw at my heart
15|Is there anything that you can offer me
15|in return for my admiration years ago?
15|A twisted light brings us back together
15|and suddenly my loneliness is lit up
15|On the waterside I see the summer haze
15|One day it will be gone like the flowers
15|I'm afflicted by incurable sadness
15|I made up an excuse to keep others at bay
15|I'd like to plant a faint kiss of goodbye on that
15|and be someone who turns around to face you in the crowd
15|Before everything grows faint and dim,
15|I want to find use for my pain
15|Scene no. 403
15|Why did Numachi meet Kaiki?
15|I didn't know that, and I couldn't ask.
15|It is possible that Kaiki was aware of Numachi's whereabouts,
15|but the conversation would surely have touched upon the devil and my left hand.
15|I felt it was too dangerous to divulge that much information to him.
15|What I am truly interested in is Numachi, who gave the information to Kaiki.
15|Why did she do that?
15|What for?
15|Did she realize, in some way, that I am on her trail?
15|Either way, the time had passed to be picky about my methods.
15|It's a mistake to try to look cool.
15|Hey, Karen. Can I ask you a favor?
15|Sure.
15|I think there's a girl called Numachi Rouka somewhere in town.
15|Can you look for her?
15|Sure.
15|I can tell you the junior high she went to.
15|Awesome.
15|That should be enough for Tsukihi to find something out.
15|Um... Let's see...
15|I'll call you in the morning.
15|Thanks.
15|I'll make it up to you.
15|Come on. Just hang out with us some day.
15|Thank you.
16|Scene no. 1
16|Back when I went to school, I thought it was way too impolite to address your homeroom teacher without honorifics.
16|Scene no. 2
16|So no matter how useless and unmotivated they seemed as teachers, I addressed them politely.
16|I thought that made me a polite, well-mannered kid.
16|Scene no. 2
16|But now that I think back, I wonder if maybe the ones who called the teacher by their first name had the right idea.
16|Scene no. 4
16|I had the right manners, but I wasn't right.
16|Scene no. 4
16|It's been a long time since I went to school, so I find myself thinking those things,

16|Scene no. 8
16|Hey there, Kanbaru.
16|You stole my left arm, didn't you?
16|No, I just took it off your hands.
16|Or well, collected it from you.
16|When?
16|When did you do it?
16|When you were getting off to me fondling your chest.
16|That was only the setup, though.
16|It probably only took effect the next morning.
16|Kaiki didn't know you were the collector, huh?
16|Nah. That scamster knows exactly who I am.
16|He's a rather strange man.
16|You can't really call it fraud.
16|Scene no. 51
16|No matter when, no matter who he's up against,
16|he makes it a point not to reveal more than half of what he knows.
16|I don't think I really understand that principle.
16|Scene no. 53
16|He wants to be a well-meaning third party at all times—
16|not the deciding factor in a story.
16|He doesn't even want a supporting role, he wants to pull the strings from behind the scenes.
16|Scene no. 55
16|He knew exactly who I was,
16|and he probably figured out that you'd already had your arm stolen.
16|But he didn't tell me.
16|Scene no. 58
16|I don't understand why.
16|Not so much his policy as his curse.
16|So Numachi really is the collector?
16|If so.
16|Scene no. 60
16|Numachi, were you collecting more than the misfortune of others?
16|You were collecting parts of the devil too?
16|Why would you do this?
16|I don't get it.
16|Hey, Kanbaru.
16|Are you free after school?
16|I am.
16|I'll be waiting for you in the gym, then.
16|Let's talk things out there.
16|What is this I have stuck inside my heart?
16|It grows so large I have to talk about it
16|In the prison that we call freedom
16|we live half in the past
16|I'm prisoner to your confused response
16|Thinking about all the right and wrong decisions now
16|Now you are gone from this chaotic world
16|My feelings lie buried deep
16|I run alone to where my heart
16|commands me
16|I cut myself loose from the words that tied me down
16|Nobody will equal me
16|in my honesty to myself
16|when I decide
16|to find someone else now

16|Scene no. 75
16|Up for some one-on-one?
16|Sure.
16|Scene no. 84
16|One hour later
16|Scene no. 168
16|You should've dunked.
16|There's no way I could've stopped that one-on-one in my current state.
16|I don't really like dunking much.
16|That so?
16|It's against the rules, in my eyes.
16|Maybe that's a bit exaggerated.
16|Scene no. 170
16|You could call it a part of freestyle basketball.
16|It exists more as a crowd-pleaser than a tool to win games.
16|To a midget like me, though, it's an awesome technique that turns me green with envy.
16|You say that like I'm a skyscraper.
16|If I could ask the devil to grant me one wish,
16|I'd probably wish to be taller.
16|But if I did that, I'd end up killing everyone taller than me, huh?
16|What about you? What did you ask for, Kanbaru?
16|I'd rather not say.
16|Don't be like that.
16|Didn't we just bare our souls to each other...
16|through this guy here?
16|What's there to hide at this point?
16|I guess that's true.
16|In that case, Numachi,
16|promise me you'll come clean too.
16|I don't mind, but what do you want to know?
16|What you've been doing these past three years.
16|Deal.
16|However, you go first.
16|Scene no. 201
16|You can't call it a very interesting story.
16|Scene no. 202
16|Just this and that about my left arm.
16|Monkey's Paw
16|Scene no. 202
16|I told my story while omitting that Araragi is a vampire.
16|Scene no. 202
16|So you asked for speed and for the Valhalla Duo to make a comeback, eh?
16|As wishes go, they're quite plain.
16|So plain you could call them run of the mill.
16|That's a pretty acid reaction after you convinced someone to share their story.
16|Scene no. 206
16|I knew you swung that way, Kanbaru.
16|What's that supposed to mean?
16|I always found it fishy the way you looked at your teammates and opponents.
16|I never gave any of those pure basketball players around me dirty looks.
16|Scene no. 211
16|I think.
16|I hope.
16|Sadly I can't say so with great confidence.
16|Say, wanna kiss?
16|I happen to like girls more than those crass boys too.
16|I could run away at any time.
16|I should be able to,
16|but I can't.
16|Pink
16|Unnumbered Scene
16|That means you don't want to.
16|Most problems can be solved by running away,
16|but a lot of people think that means admitting defeat.
16|In my eyes, they only look like they're willingly plunging themselves in misfortune.
16|Willingly?
16|Sprinting toward misfortune
16|Scene no. 231
16|Escape
16|Scene no. 231
16|Running away doesn't mean you lose,
16|and it won't always make you unhappy either.
16|Failing to escape merely helps you resign yourself to your fate.
16|Could it be that deep down, you want me to kiss you by force?
16|H-Hang on a sec!
16|Someone might see us!
16|They won't.
16|Smooch.
16|Disappointed?
16|She played me for a fool!
16|Let's keep things pure, shall we?
16|We've got our whole lives ahead of us,
16|so we shouldn't play with fire too much.
16|Don't you hate dunking
16|Scene no. 269
16|because it seems cheap to you?
16|What a wasted talent.
16|What the hell? I know for a fact that you couldn't dunk back in junior high.
16|And with your leg in that state...
16|Yep. This is the state my leg's in.
16|Anyway, I've taken on all of your suffering.
16|The devil will shoulder it all for you.
16|You don't have to worry about it anymore.
16|Forget about the devil's left arm and live your life with a happy smile on your face.
16|It's not that simple.
16|That arm's the symbol of the sins I bear.
16|It's my arm.
16|No, it's not. It's the devil's.
16|And from what that scumbag told me, this belonged to your mother.
16|It has never, ever been yours.
16|Not once.
16|It's gotten smaller!
16|Why?
16|Isn't that obvious, Kanbaru?
16|Your first wish was granted.
16|The devil's arm should've grown right then.
16|I think you said something like that earlier too.
16|Now that you mention it...
16|But...
16|I left the part of your soul that the devil took back then within you.
16|That's why this paw's back to its original size.
16|The price I paid the first time?
16|What? That's just absurd.
16|Scene no. 301
16|That was a contract with a devil, and they're not so easily swayed,
16|and there's no way they'd just let me get my body back.
16|Scene no. 301
16|More fundamentally, what exactly is meant by "collecting the parts of the devil"?
16|Scene no. 301
16|I kept my word and told you all about that arm.
16|It's your turn now.
16|What exactly have you been doing these past three years?
16|You know, promises aren't meant to be kept or broken.
16|They're meant to be ignored.
16|And how is that any different to breaking them, exactly?
16|Well, you don't break them.
16|You just put them off.
16|And in that time, promises cease to be promises.
16|Get it?
16|People can even run from fate itself.
16|That's the kinda thing I'll be telling you about now.
16|Just to be clear, this is not a story.
16|It's what comes after a basketball player loses her career—
16|after the period at the end of her sentence.
16|It's like an unnecessary epilogue of sorts.
16|Look at the shape my leg's in.
16|It's more like a devil's than a monkey's, right?
16|But know this, Kanbaru:
16|This is not the only devil I house within my body.
16|Scene no. 328
16|Now, then.
16|Where do I even begin?
16|I could start with the regional tournament three years ago where I lost my left leg.
16|That'd be the shortest and simplest route,
16|but it wouldn't be enough for you to get a glimpse into how I see the world.
16|I've always held an interest in the misfortune of others,
16|only it was the exact opposite to how I think now.
16|You could call that two different extremes.
16|Scene no. 334
16|Back then, I would compare the misfortune of others to my own fortune
16|and then scratch my head in disbelief.
16|"Why was I blessed with a talent that nobody else has?"
16|Oh, and by talent, I'm referring to my athleticism here.
16|You could also take it to mean my ball control.
16|Actually...
16|If you were to whittle it down even further, it'd be my excellent footwork.
16|I played soccer in grade school, you see.
16|Thing is, I went too far.
16|I was a girl playing soccer with the boys,
16|and I was head and shoulders above them, to boot.
16|No wonder they hated me.
16|Here's what I thought in that situation:
16|"If only everyone was equally talented, nobody would come to hate me."
16|"So why does the world have to be divided into the talented and the untalented?"
16|I strove to hide my talents after that.
16|I tried not to do anything flashy and focused on defense.
16|That's probably what eventually became the swampy defense you all know today.
16|Those who have talent
16|Scene no. 346
16|must, above all else, fear the long-standing societal tradition
16|of hammering in the nail that sticks out.
16|Scene no. 346
16|Why I quit soccer and switched to basketball?
16|No reason in particular.
16|It's just that I grew out of soccer the same time I graduated grade school.
16|As for why I picked basketball out of the many sports out there...
16|Scene no. 354
16|Well, soccer's a sport you play with your feet,
16|so I wanted to try one where I could handle the ball next.
16|Maybe you'd have joined the handball club if there'd been one in junior high.
16|Scene no. 356
16|I said I had nice footwork, remember?
16|So I tried raising the difficulty level.
16|Scene no. 358
16|From "easy" to "normal."
16|Scene no. 358
16|Yeah, normal.
16|That's all basketball was to me.
16|Turn that frown upside down, Kanbaru.
16|If you don't like being called too serious, then you should learn to let these things slide.
16|Look at it this way. I lost my left leg as punishment for playing a sport with such flimsy motives.
16|I truly did get my "just deserts."
16|She doesn't seem to doubt herself,
16|Scene no. 364
16|but I understand her.
16|I was the one who destroyed my leg myself.
16|The doctors diagnosed it as a stress fracture.
16|Those who totally rely on their talent
16|Scene no. 366
16|often end up like this.
16|Scene no. 366
16|I was like an empty shell after I got hospitalized.
16|After all, even I'm only human.
16|I'm as prone to feeling sad or depressed as anyone else.
16|It was only after I lost basketball, the sport I'd started playing simply to raise the bar for myself,
16|that I realized how much I loved it.
16|She realized the talent she'd been squandering was fragile and irreplaceable.
16|Scene no. 369
16|She realized how much emphasis she'd placed on it for herself.
16|Scene no. 369
16|And thus, I became unhappy.
16|I became this pitiful, unhappy little thing.
16|Funnily enough, the teammates I'd been at loggerheads with and the teachers that found me a pain in the neck
16|suddenly became all nice and even came to visit me in the hospital.
16|"Sorry for everything. We were pushing you too hard."
16|Man, that moved me to tears.
16|We held each other's hands and apologized for everything.
16|But as soon as they left the hospital, I scratched my head in disbelief.
16|What the hell am I doing, I wondered.
16|Sure, I was touched, but so fucking what?
16|That didn't change reality— the fact that my left leg couldn't handle sports anymore.
16|So I quit school.
16|I even hated being in the general vicinity of it, so I begged my parents and got them to move.
16|My mother blamed herself, so I didn't have to pressure them
16|Scene no. 377
16|to run away.
16|Scene no. 377
16|Now, here's what happened before I moved—
16|before I ran away.
16|It's what sparked my present hobby— my sickening hobby—of collecting misfortune.
16|One of my teammates came to visit me.
16|She was the one who showed me the path I was meant to walk.
16|I'll forever be indebted and grateful to her.
16|Needless to say, I wasn't close to her.
16|Scene no. 383
16|Not at all.
16|One day, she suddenly came to my hospital room by herself and,
16|after exchanging all the usual pleasantries,
16|said she wanted my advice on something.
16|The contents were typical of a junior high school student's problems.
16|Scene no. 385
16|Some blahblah about the boy she liked and her classmates in school.
16|Nothing you can resolve in any way. Worst thing to seek advice for.
16|But that wasn't the point.
16|She didn't come to the wrong person.
16|From her point of view, she came to the perfect person.
16|Scene no. 385
16|She wanted the advice of someone clearly worse off than her.
16|Someone like me, who had nothing to live for.
16|Long story short, she did have her share of problems and worries,
16|but she didn't want to be pitied for it.
16|I understood her, because after I hurt my leg,
16|Scene no. 393
16|the friendliness of others made me gloomy.
16|Troubled as she was, she didn't want the advice of someone who'd look down on her.
16|Why I didn't get mad at her?
16|That's because she was under a grave misunderstanding.
16|The truth is,
16|listening to her served as great consolation to me.
16|There's nothing sweeter than schadenfreude.
16|And even with a broken leg, it tasted just as divine.
16|Knowing that I wasn't alone in having problems healed my broken heart.
16|I could feel warmth returning to it.
16|We licked each other's wounds
16|Scene no. 403
16|and weighed our respective unhappiness.
16|Scene no. 403
16|Once I realized that, the rest of it was all fun and games.
16|I tried all sorts of things to figure out the best way to extract every last bit of sorrow and suffering from her.
16|Well, it was kinda like the devil's internship period.
16|Repeatedly thinking myself a horrible person, I feasted on all of her worries.
16|That made me feel like I'd been saved a little.
16|That said,
16|Scene no. 408
16|I did not listen to her stories until the end of time.
16|Then one day, I said to her while sending her off,
16|"I get all your problems."
16|I wasn't lying.
16|And I kept going.
16|"I'll solve them for you, so you don't have to worry about a thing."
16|Now that was a lie.
16|A giant fib.
16|A selfish lie I told because I didn't want her coming back the next day to talk to me again.
16|She gave me a funny look,
16|Scene no. 421
16|and although she seemed confused a little,
16|she said "Thanks" and went home.
16|Scene no. 421
16|But I didn't see what happened a while after that coming.
16|I think it was right when I was about to be discharged that she came by my hospital room again.
16|She looked like the world had been lifted off her shoulders.
16|And then she thanked me. With a thousand-watt smile on her face.
16|She was so excited I could make neither head nor tail of what she was saying,
16|but I could tell her problems had been solved without a hitch.
16|Basically, it was a simple example of time healing all wounds.
16|While she'd entrusted her problems to me and stopped worrying about them,
16|they ceased to be problems.
16|"C'mon, no need to thank me. I just did what I had to do."
16|Scene no. 429
16|So I said and hoped she'd just go and leave.
16|Her misfortune was like music to my ears.
16|It healed me.
16|Not only did she come to me, someone she saw as worse off than she was, meaning she could freely ask for advice,
16|but she was actually freed from her burden by entrusting me with her issues.
16|On top of that, time—and in her eyes, I—solved all of them for her.
16|That didn't hurt anyone, did it?
16|In fact, it actually saved everyone involved.
16|Scene no. 433
16|Anyway.
16|I could help people and heal my own wounds at the same time.
16|Kill two birds with one stone.
16|Not to mention, it was minimal investment for maximum reward.
16|So I made my decision right away.
16|I was bereft of the kind of conscience and morals that would make me spend a sleepless night worrying about it.
16|Maybe they'd been a part of me in the past,
16|but such values broke down with my left leg.
16|I decided to make that my purpose in life.
16|On second thought, it wasn't such a positive feeling.
16|I felt more like I'd found my perfect resting place as an athlete.
16|So, yeah, I decided to make that my tombstone.
16|And thus, Numachi Rouka, collector of misfortune, was born.
16|Scene no. 439
16|That was an awfully long autobiography, but there's more to it, right?
16|I get what got you started with collecting misfortune.
16|I get your motive too.
16|It's admirable—suits your taste, benefits you, and even helps others.
16|It's making me go weak in the knees here.
16|How unlike you to be so sarcastic.
16|But that's only half of it.
16|You still haven't told me why you started collecting not only misfortune, but also parts of the devil.
16|Oh, I was just about to get to that.
16|But I figured I should signal halftime and give you a choice first.
16|A choice?
16|I wonder why Numachi irritates me so much.
16|Scene no. 451
16|What's that supposed to mean?
16|That easy, normal, and hard thing again?
16|You telling me to choose a method of communication?
16|Nah, it's nothing that fancy.
16|You simply have to choose between two options: whether you want to hear the rest or not.
16|From this point onward, this truly becomes the story of the devil.
16|If you can get by without knowing, then I think you're better off that way.
16|It'd be easier for you to go back to leading a normal life.
16|Like, you know...
16|Make friends, fall in love, read books, and tap away at your phone and all that.
16|Knock it off, Numachi.
16|You're the one who has to make a choice, not me.
16|Either tell me everything or give back the devil's arm.
16|You're the one who has a decision to make here!
16|Whoa, how scary.
16|I'll keep going, then.
16|I'll tell you how I met the devil.
16|But let me just say this: this sob story won't provide any consolation to anyone.
16|Bit too late for that.
16|I'd never lose it
16|It will always gnaw at my heart
16|Is there anything that you can offer me
16|in return for my admiration years ago?
16|A twisted light brings us back together
16|and suddenly my loneliness is lit up
16|On the waterside I see the summer haze
16|One day it will be gone like the flowers
16|I'm afflicted by incurable sadness
16|I made up an excuse to keep others at bay
16|I'd like to plant a faint kiss of goodbye on that
16|and be someone who turns around to face you in the crowd
16|Before everything grows faint and dim,
16|I want to find use for my pain
17|Scene no. 1
17|You're so weird.
17|Though I guess I can understand wanting to know the whole story.
17|Shown the light by the girl who came to me for advice when I was hospitalized,
17|I began collecting misfortune.
17|Of course, it'd be a while before I actually began work as a collector.
17|First, I had to get through rehab.
17|But the doctor actually said my leg would never go back to the way it used to be.
17|Said I was married to the cast and crutch for the rest of my life.
17|And well, that depressed me. A lot.
17|Still, he told me not to stay cooped up at home
17|and to make an effort to go outside as much as possible. That piece of advice helped.
17|It was the perfect excuse to give my parents whenever I went outside to do some collecting.
17|The devil had finally put up shop.
17|First order of business was to get away from my neighborhood.
17|Things didn't go too well in the beginning, but over time,
17|I learned how to spread rumors in an unfamiliar town and how to take requests.
17|You're smart enough to have figured out how I got to know Kaiki Deishuu by now, right?
17|Yup. We had a turf war of sorts in a town I went to.
17|You see, there are some similarities between his scamming operations and my collecting work.
17|I'm not in it for the money, but our methods resemble each other so much you could call us colleagues.
17|Just so you know, that doesn't mean I approve of his scams.
17|He misuses his knowledge of charms to swindle money out of innocent people.
17|Talk about evil.
17|But we can't forget that some people have actually been saved by his actions.
17|Nothing in this world is evil through and through.
17|And every evil out there is helping one thing or another.
17|That goes for all evils,
17|and all devils.
17|Black
17|Unnumbered Scene
17|On the other hand, all good hurts one thing or another.
17|When they say there are no absolutes in life,
17|it also applies to the concepts of absolute good and absolute evil.
17|Of course, that doesn't mean Kaiki and I were allies.
17|It's just that after we had a bit of a conflict,
17|we signed a pact to exchange information to prevent it from happening again.
17|Now, Kaiki's not the only existence I became aware of at that point.
17|What else do you think it could be?
17|That's right.
17|Charms...
17|and oddities.
17|Oddity
17|Scene no. 34
17|Kaiki told me about the existence of oddities as a man who specialized in them.
17|Actually, since he doesn't believe in spirits himself,
17|what he told me about was the theory that they existed.
17|And that proved to be foreshadowing.
17|Foreshadowing for my foray into devil collecting.
17|What is this I have stuck inside my heart?
17|It grows so large I have to talk about it
17|In the prison that we call freedom
17|we live half in the past
17|I'm prisoner to your confused response
17|Thinking about all the right and wrong decisions now
17|Now you are gone from this chaotic world
17|My feelings lie buried deep
17|I run alone to where my heart
17|commands me
17|I cut myself loose from the words that tied me down
17|Nobody will equal me
17|in my honesty to myself
17|when I decide
17|to find someone else now
17|Episode Strange
17|Suruga Devil Episode Four

17|I wonder how long I'd been a collector by then.
17|It's not like I cataloged the parts of my collection,
17|so I have no idea what page she'd be on.
17|But one thing's for sure:
17|that girl—
17|Hanadori Rouka—
17|was the very first piece of my devil collection.
17|Hanadori Rouka
17|"Help me," she begged.
17|She had track pants on beneath her uniform.
17|A really baggy pair just like the one I'm wearing right now.
17|Then she took them off in front of me.
17|I'm sure you can tell that her leg had turned into the devil's.
17|"This leg's trying to kill my mother," she said.
17|She had a boyfriend in college who she'd promised to marry,
17|and had gotten pregnant with his child.
17|Her mother was obviously against it and told her to get an abortion.
17|And so she turned to the devil.
17|Just like you once made a wish to the mummified left arm,
17|she made hers to the mummified left leg.
17|The devil tried to fulfill it by getting rid of the mother
17|and possessed Hanadori's leg to do so.
17|That ended in failure.
17|Hanadori went into a trance late one night
17|and stomped a mudhole in her mother who was sleeping under the same roof.
17|But she didn't manage to kill her.
17|She soon realized that she was the one who sent her mother to the hospital.
17|That backed her into a corner she couldn't escape from.
17|What do you think went through my mind then?
17|I... wanted to help her.
17|I'm not lying.
17|For the first time in my life, I wanted to help someone from the bottom of my heart.
17|Shows that even a devil can become an angel, if only for a second.
17|I was a terrible human being, but that wasn't all I was.
17|I wanted to do something for Hanadori.
17|I wanted to take her place if I could.
17|So I embraced her...
17|Numachi Rouka embraced Hanadori Rouka.
17|Hugged her without a word,
17|and held her tight.
17|And then I told her:
17|"It's all right.
17|I'll take care of all your problems.
17|I'll solve them for sure,
17|so you don't have to worry about anything."
17|I whispered those irresponsible words in her ear.
17|Not once or twice.
17|I repeated them over and over again.
17|Was I crying?
17|It's not the coolest thing in the world, but I'm sure I was crying there.
17|Even after she left me alone,
17|my emotions wouldn't settle down.
17|I kept thinking I wanted to help her—save her.
17|It's not like I could do anything, though.
17|So I decided to go see Kaiki Deishuu.
17|A scamster he may be, but as a self-proclaimed ghostbuster,
17|I thought he'd be able to figure things out.
17|So I immediately called him.
17|He said it'd cost me. A lot.
17|And I said I didn't mind—that I was willing to pay any price.
17|How cool of me.
17|But as it turned out, I didn't have to pay him at all.
17|I realized the next morning that within its cast, my left leg...
17|had turned into that of the devil.
17|Scene no. 66
17|What happened to Hanadori Rouka after that?
17|Beats me.
17|That was the only time I saw her.
17|Her pregnancy,
17|Scene no. 71
17|her relationship with her parents,
17|and, incidentally,
17|her relationship with someone frivolous enough to knock up a high school girl,
17|were all entirely outside my influence.
17|Scene no. 71
17|There was nothing else I could do.
17|By the way, what I did wasn't an act of selflessness.
17|I did get a little something out of it.
17|I mean,
17|I obtained the devil's left leg as the perfect replacement for my own, broken one.
17|So your cast and crutch were fakes?
17|Well, yeah.
17|It's statistical truth that people are more loose-lipped when asking a disabled person for advice.
17|I couldn't throw away such an advantage.
17|So...
17|Basically, nothing changed. You kept collecting misfortune even after that.
17|Obviously.
17|But at the same time, I also found myself another hobby.
17|Black
17|Unnumbered Scene
17|Collecting devil parts, that is.
17|In the end, there was no need to rely on Kaiki,
17|Scene no. 84
17|but we kept exchanging information.
17|After that, I learned what this devil was all about from that man.
17|I recognized it as my enemy.
17|Enemy?
17|Yeah. A business rival.
17|It nullifies people's worries—
17|turns their misfortune into something irreparable.
17|Hence, a business rival.
17|One that had to be destroyed.
17|Every time I heard a rumor about it, I visited the town it originated from and engaged in some devil busting.
17|Or well, devil collection.
17|Does that mean...
17|Bingo.
17|It's not just my arm and leg.
17|Various parts of my body have turned into that of the devil.
17|That's the end of my flashback, Kanbaru.
17|You get it now, right?
17|I took your left arm for purely selfish reasons.
17|Simply to satisfy my own desires.
17|So Numachi said.
17|Scene no. 104
17|How much of the devil's body have you managed to collect so far?
17|Not even a third.
17|What if you got it all?
17|Wouldn't you become the devil yourself?
17|Maybe so,
17|but I actually intend to absorb it.
17|Is that even possible?
17|Scene no. 121
17|Sacrificing your body—
17|throwing it away.
17|Not out of a desire to help others.
17|Not out of a desire to desire something of the completed devil.
17|Is there any kind of meaning
17|in Numachi's life?
17|Scene no. 121
17|Well, then.
17|Goodbye, Kanbaru.
17|We probably won't meet again.
17|Lead a good life.
17|Like, take entrance exams, make new friends,
17|find a boyfriend, land a job, get married, raise children,
17|and then fight with them.
17|I hope you experience very human things.
17|Because I wasn't able to.
17|Scene no. 155
17|Oh, right.
17|That's right.
17|I can do whatever I want now.
17|I can use my left hand to take my clothes off or play basketball.

17|Hello, Suruga?
17|Uh, I'm sorry. Were you asleep?
17|Nah, don't worry.
17|I was just lying down for a bit.
17|Sorry. I'll keep it short.
17|I called because I found information about Numachi Rouka, the girl you asked me to look into yesterday.
17|Oh, I see.
17|I'm sorry to say this after making you do all that,
17|but I already met her today.
17|You met her?
17|Yeah.
17|That can't be right.
17|What do you mean?
17|I actually was with her until—
17|You couldn't have met her.
17|Because Numachi Rouka
17|committed suicide three years ago.
17|Scene no. 193
17|She broke her leg during a basketball game in junior high and lost her playing career.
17|So she quit her school and, before she graduated from the school she transferred to,
17|slit her wrist.

17|It wasn't just about her leg.
17|She also had serious family issues, apparently.
17|It was impossible to tell because she was such an aloof girl,
17|but she'd been leading a complicated life.
17|Suicide, though?
17|I see.
17|So the Numachi I met was a ghost, huh?
17|All right.
17|Time for a run!
17|Scene no. 231
17|April 17th
17|My legs hurt.
17|I should have paid attention to my form at least.
17|But if I had, I'd never have made it this far.
17|That's right...
17|Senjougahara had beautiful form.
17|Very beautiful.
17|She was saying she had to lose a few pounds and started running again last year or so.
17|It was so beautiful.
17|I wish I had such beautiful form.

17|Sorry. I'll get out of the way.
17|Hey, are you okay?
17|Kanbaru?
17|Araragi?
17|Scene no. 291
17|I'm so, so, so disappointed! You're driving a car!
17|Shut up.
17|Let me enjoy my car.
17|Do you have any idea how hard getting a license was?
17|Didn't you say that bicycles were your life?
17|You said you admired road bikes.
17|I was such a fool for still feeling bad about wrecking your mountain bike.
17|You should still feel bad about it.
17|And your car looks like a bar of soap!
17|This isn't what a man should be driving.
17|Don't make fun of how round my car is!
17|You can make fun of me, but leave my car alone!
17|This is the best vehicle design in the entire world!
17|Didn't you say a man should be driving supercars?
17|Did I really say that?
17|Black
17|Unnumbered Scene
17|Seriously though, hearing someone else say the word "supercar" gives me goosebumps.
17|I wish I'd never known this side of Araragi.
17|Scene no. 319
17|It's okay. My next project will be going back to high school like nothing happened.
17|I can't believe you were able to afford a foreign car fresh out of high school.
17|Did you take out a loan?
17|Congratulations
17|Nah, graduation gift from my parents.
17|The disappointment!
17|Is something wrong?
17|Despite the switch from bicycle to car
17|Scene no. 343
17|and him having grown out his hair and nails,
17|this is still Araragi.
17|Scene no. 343
17|I've lost control.
17|Nothing is really working out the way I planned.
17|I'm really insecure right now.
17|You've been insecure for a long time.
17|I think I'm just lonely now that you and Senjougahara have graduated.
17|Let me tell you, Senjougahara is also pretty lonely.
17|She misses you.
17|And you?
17|Of course I miss you.
17|A lot.
17|You're really the only one who can follow my conversations into the really seedy depths.
17|I see.
17|What's not working out for you?
17|It's not like you to just run and run until you collapse.
17|Like me, huh?
17|I don't know what's typical of me anymore.
17|You don't know anymore?
17|Yeah.
17|What's typical of me anyway?
17|What do you believe is typical of yourself, Araragi?
17|Huh...
17|I don't really know.
17|I had my hands full trying to lead by example.
17|Looking at it like that, maybe you were the one who defined who I was.
17|I was?
17|In the end, we all adjust our personalities in a way that appeals to those we want to like.
17|It's a bit dishonest though, I think.
17|While you're embroiled in that deception, you lose and lose sight of so much.
17|Things you lose...
17|You're right.
17|I feel like I've already lost so much.
17|I want to do something about the situation I'm facing.
17|But on the other hand, I feel that the best course of action would be to do nothing.
17|Doing nothing is best?
17|How so?
17|It doesn't bother anybody.
17|Should you really interfere when someone is happy despite their misfortune?
17|What's the point in going out of your way to tell them they should be unhappy?
17|If they're enjoying their misfortune, then those around them have no business interfering.
17|I don't get it.
17|Look, Kanbaru.
17|If you think no one is bothered by it, you're wrong.
17|Because at the very least, it bothers you.
17|That's enough of a reason to take action.
17|Being bothered by something is the best reason there could possibly be to take action.
17|Incidentally, it bothers me when something bothers you.
17|It bothers Senjougahara too.
17|Right.
17|Scene no. 410
17|I remember.
17|He always says stuff like that.
17|Scene no. 410
17|I'm not parroting Oshino here.
17|The only one who can improve your situation is you yourself.
17|But Araragi,
17|that feeling of irritation will eventually pass.
17|What I think is bothering me now will eventually stop bothering me in time.
17|That's just stupid.
17|Did someone tell you that?
17|You wouldn't normally say something like that.
17|"Don't think too much."
17|"Think more."
17|That kind of thing.
17|Yeah.
17|Lots of people told me lots of things lately.
17|Numachi.
17|Scene no. 427
17|Kaiki.
17|My mother.
17|Ignore them.
17|Whoever those people are, they aren't you.
17|When did you get smart enough to consider how others feel?
17|I've always done the things I wanted to do.
17|You should do whatever you want to do.
17|I wanted to live up to your expectations purely for my own reasons,
17|and if you want to adopt the views of others because you truly want to, then I suppose that's okay, too,
17|but if you can't agree with something, you have to fight it.
17|I fought with Senjougahara, Hanekawa, Oshino—
17|I even fought with you, who expects so much of me.
17|Okay.
17|I agree with your opinion, Araragi.
17|That's why I'll fight.
17|Good luck.
17|If I can help somehow, do tell me.
17|I'm fine!
17|Okay.
17|That's good to hear.
17|If you really want to help, whip my room into shape in a few days.
17|Stop being such a slob!
17|I'd never lose it
17|It will always gnaw at my heart
17|Is there anything that you can offer me
17|in return for my admiration years ago?
17|A twisted light brings us back together
17|and suddenly my loneliness is lit up
17|On the waterside I see the summer haze
17|One day it will be gone like the flowers
17|I'm afflicted by incurable sadness
17|I made up an excuse to keep others at bay
17|I'd like to plant a faint kiss of goodbye on that
17|and be someone who turns around to face you in the crowd
17|Before everything grows faint and dim,
17|I want to find use for my pain

18|we live half in the past
18|I'm prisoner to your confused response
18|Thinking about all the right and wrong decisions now
18|Now you are gone from this chaotic world
18|My feelings lie buried deep
18|I run alone to where my heart
18|commands me

18|Scene no. 16
18|April 20th
18|Didn't think we'd meet again, Kanbaru.
18|This is just like that feeling right before you drift off to sleep when you suddenly remember something you forgot.
18|I figured you'd be here, Numachi.
18|I'm sure you already know about this from Kaiki.
18|That scoundrel.
18|So he had it after all.
18|And the head is the most important of all, too.
18|Unbelievable.
18|He may prefer to tell people only half of the truth, but this is just pure deception.
18|Perhaps he was going to steal the other parts from me after I had them all assembled.
18|Or maybe he'd have forced me to buy it.
18|I'm inclined to say the answer is the latter.
18|Right when the goods would command the highest price—
18|Actually, selling the complete set to a scholar would have raked in the most.
18|Kanbaru...
18|Will you give me that mummy part—
18|that demon's head?
18|I won't.
18|I don't want to be cold to my former arch-enemy after you've come all the way here to meet me,
18|but I can't give this to you.
18|Why?
18|I wonder.
18|If I had to give a reason,
18|I suppose it would be a lingering concern that, upon having collected all parts, you yourself would become the devil.
18|Scene no. 40
18|Play with the devil and you will be turned into him?
18|I'm not like you or others.
18|I'm not that weak.
18|Really, now?
18|This is the head.
18|It still contains the brain.
18|I guess you're probably right.
18|You can do it.
18|You're strong.
18|You won't ask something of the devil.
18|You will work toward any wishes you have yourself.
18|So if you really want a reason,
18|it's because I can't stand looking at you.
18|Can't stand looking at me?
18|Then look away.
18|You're visible to me.
18|Scene no. 51
18|Precisely because you're visible to me,
18|I cannot stand looking at you.
18|If you look at the essence of it, all acts in this world are like that.
18|Being unable to stand the view of something, unable to leave something alone— that stance begets all else.
18|We can stand looking at neither good nor evil.
18|You see what you never wanted to, and you can't stand the sight of it.
18|Let's have a game, Numachi.
18|A game. In this gym, on this court. One-on-one.
18|If you win, you can have this wonderful cultural artifact.
18|And if I win, you will stop collecting misfortune and parts of the devil forevermore.
18|Now that's just ridiculous.
18|Is there any reason why I should accept those terms?
18|Yes.
18|You can make sure that I won't smash this mummy part with a hammer.
18|Smash it?
18|Are you serious?
18|You bet!
18|The collector should find this unrefusable.
18|In fact, how can you walk away from this as a basketball player?
18|Just so you know:
18|if that mummy part is on the line, I won't play around like we did the other day.
18|I will be serious.
18|Really?
18|I thought that was all you have.
18|If I'd been serious, I would have used the devil's leg and arm.
18|Kanbaru, do you think a human can win against me?
18|I wouldn't challenge you if I didn't think so.
18|If Araragi stood here in my place,
18|Scene no. 79
18|he'd think of some even bigger ruse.
18|What do you say?
18|Let's do it.
18|This is a no-brainer.
18|I'd like to ask something first.
18|I agree that it is beneficial for me to have this game.
18|But what about you?
18|Kanbaru, why is it beneficial for you to have it?
18|I told you.
18|If I win, you'll stop collecting devil parts and the misfortune of others.
18|The matter of unhappiness aside...
18|Scene no. 83
18|I'll make sure the parts you've already collected will be disposed of.
18|That is certainly harmful to me, but how is it beneficial for you?
18|That's irrelevant.
18|What harms you is part of what benefits me.
18|Oh, I see.
18|It's because you hate me.
18|Precisely.
18|Did you seriously think your personality wouldn't aggravate others?
18|You might've realized this already,
18|but I could simply use the devil's power to take the head from you by force, bypassing our game.
18|Are you not afraid of that?
18|No, I don't think I am.
18|Numachi.
18|I think you're able to steal from others, but I don't think you can rob them.
18|At least that's what I'd like to think.
18|I think that's typical of you.
18|How trustworthy I seem to be.
18|You left the box on the floor and strip down in front of me.
18|I'm a bit of an exhibitionist.
18|Then this year that you spent hiding your arm must have been utter hell.
18|It was.
18|Right. Let's get started.
18|Let the game begin.
18|Getting the remaining parts once I have the head should be a trivial matter.
18|It is, after all, the abode of the soul.
18|Abode
18|Scene no. 108
18|Soul
18|Scene no. 108
18|Let's not go back to that endless tossing we did the other day.
18|You would never be able to win a war of attrition.
18|I wouldn't be able to call that winning.
18|Do you dislike being utterly dominant?
18|No, I don't.
18|I just don't want to listen to your complaints later.
18|All right.
18|Let's do it like this, then.
18|A single possession, each of us doing what we do best.
18|A single possession?
18|I'm on offense.
18|You're on defense.
18|One-on-one. One possession.
18|If I score fair and square, I win.
18|If you stop me fair and square, you win.
18|Where I come from, running, this would be the 50m sprint,
18|Scene no. 125
18|and where you come from, soccer, this would be a penalty shootout.
18|That gives me an unacceptable advantage.
18|It doesn't.
18|I wouldn't suggest these terms if I didn't think I'd win.
18|Very well.
18|If we both think that we have this in the bag,
18|then I will accept your terms.
18|Let's get this over with then.
18|I'm loath to keep active players from practicing here forever.
18|Say, Numachi.
18|What?
18|Don't you feel like ascending or something?
18|What are you talking about?
18|Are you trying to be metaphorical with my half-devil state?
18|If so, the metaphor doesn't quite work.
18|Devils find redemption, don't they?
18|Asking about my ascendance makes it sound like I'm a ghost.
18|Anyway, Kanbaru.
18|Can you spare a shoe for me?
18|I don't need basketball shoes; gym shoes are enough.
18|Thinking about it, I don't think I can win against you bare-footed.
18|Okay.
18|Someone should have their spare shoes salted away in the locker room.
18|Just grab those.
18|Got it.
18|The locker room is over there, right?
18|This is horrible.
18|Scene no. 157
18|This is not what I expected.
18|Scene no. 157
18|Numachi Rouka does not realize that she is dead.
18|She does not understand that she is a ghost.
18|She's not aware that she herself is an oddity collecting unhappiness.
18|She has forgotten that she killed herself.
18|Is that possible?
18|It's possible.
18|Scene no. 159
18|Nobody wants to acknowledge their own death.
18|Nobody wants to die to begin with.
18|Numachi is so aloof, likes speaking in an enlightened way, and generally seems like a very strong character,
18|Scene no. 161
18|but that in no way means that she would have to be able to accept her own death.
18|Scene no. 161
18|She wasn't lying.
18|She truly believes she's traveling through the country and collecting the misfortune of others.
18|With that in mind she adjusts her perception of the world around her to fit that story.
18|Obviously she won't ever ascend at this rate.
18|She collects misfortune and the devil's parts, ignorant of the truth.
18|I see.
18|I understand.
18|Now I understand what I'm doing here.
18|This is harder than hard.
18|Scene no. 169
18|I'm about to tell my former arch-enemy that she is already dead.
18|That's so cruel.
18|Scene no. 172
18|It's too late to stop—
18|Scene no. 172
18|I've decided I would do this.
18|She is who I may have been under different circumstances.
18|I can't stand looking at her.
18|That's why I will exorcise her.
18|I want to perform her last rites.
18|I just really
18|Scene no. 178
18|—fair and square—want to win against Numachi.
18|I want
18|to confirm that she is not I.
18|Scene no. 178
18|I want to be sure.
18|Scene no. 178
18|Sorry about that.
18|Let's get started.
18|Isn't it strange?
18|We treated each other as arch-enemies back in junior high, Kanbaru.
18|But I believe this is the first time we'll truly square off, isn't it?
18|Is it?
18|Didn't we meet on the court plenty of times?
18|We had friendlies and some training sessions together, but no official games.
18|Fate is strange, isn't it?
18|I suppose that's just the luck of the draw in tournaments.
18|I'm surprised.
18|I felt like we'd been fighting each other through all of junior high.
18|I suppose it wasn't just that our playstyles were polar opposites,
18|but that we felt something for the other in some way.
18|You forgot what you felt for me after you graduated from junior high, didn't you?
18|All you were thinking of was Senjougahara.
18|Yes, I forgot you.
18|But I remembered.
18|I will forget what happened today, too,
18|and I will remember it again someday.
18|Hey, Numachi.
18|Do you think it's better to regret the things you've done or the things you haven't done?
18|A loser's song.
18|Regretting the things you haven't done is clearly better.
18|I agree.
18|I completely agree.
18|The only ones who can claim that regretting what you haven't done is worse
18|are immature outsiders who have never experienced the regret that comes with what you have done.
18|But, you know...
18|You know,
18|the best by far is
18|not regretting what you've done.
18|Breaking through her swampy defense is hard.
18|But that only goes for me alone.
18|Never forget
18|that basketball is a game for more than one player.
18|I don't...

18|Hey, hey.
18|Didn't I win the second I had the ball?
18|You weren't in possession, so it wasn't over yet.
18|I was in possession!
18|Oh, really?
18|Why'd you get right back on defense, then?
18|To be honest, I was surprised you managed to.
18|Didn't you say dunking was against the rules?
18|It was a necessary evil.
18|My teammates rarely ever passed me the ball.
18|Getting a pass from my opponent caught me off guard.
18|It's a nice feeling.
18|I forgot—
18|No, I never realized that basketball is a team game.
18|I quit before I realized that.
18|Oh wow.
18|She's really cute.
18|I should have probably kissed her.
18|I guess I lost.
18|I feel like I truly lost at last.
18|Truly?
18|I don't really know what I lost to in life.
18|Man, you should just stop studying for exams.
18|Go back to playing basketball, Kanbaru.
18|The high school team isn't the only place where you can show off your talents.
18|Why are you treading water?
18|I suppose you are more like an idle bystander.
18|You can't put a moratorium on life.
18|You're the last person I want to hear that from.
18|I guess I can think of it as important advice from the devil.
18|I'm okay with that.
18|Want me to say something deep as well?
18|Hey, Numa—
18|Tch.
18|Always easygoing except when you make a break for it.
18|To tell the truth, I wasn't so confident I'd win.
18|Maybe you admired team play,
18|but I was always good at team play,
18|and I admired you when you held off five opponents at once.
18|That's right.
18|I didn't hate Numachi.
18|I was jealous of her.

18|That night I dreamt.
18|The motivation behind good is usually the jealousy of evil.
18|The motivation behind evil is antipathy toward good.
18|I believe that is the message which you should take away from this little episode.
18|No, Mom.
18|What I should take away from this is that it's fun to run into people you knew a bunch of years ago.
18|One day I will be grateful to my mother.
18|Scene no. 317
18|I will understand her feelings.
18|Scene no. 317
18|But that day is not today, and not anytime soon either— first I need to outdo her or at least match her achievements.
18|Scene no. 317
18|I don't think I will ever feel the same as she.
18|If you can't become medicine, then turn into poison.
18|Otherwise, you'd just be plain old water.
18|She was neither poison nor medicine.
18|If she was water, it was swamp water.
18|And what about you, Suruga?
18|I don't know.
18|Can I be hot water instead?
18|Hot water
18|Scene no. 316
18|That was awful.
18|Got told.
18|Scene no. 318
18|Well, I agree.
18|I don't... you know, have any interesting aspects to myself.
18|Well. Talk to you another time, Mom.
18|Yeah. Another time.
18|Why are you at my bedside?!
18|You're not here for—
18|Hell no.
18|Apparently, when he turned up, my grandma said "Sure, just go to her room and wake her up,"
18|Scene no. 319
18|and waved him straight to my room and bed.
18|Scene no. 319
18|Security is direly lacking.
18|To be honest, seeing you naked doesn't do anything for me by now.
18|I could sue you for that.
18|Rather, what turns me on is seeing my sisters naked.
18|Twice the offense!
18|I have two little sisters, so thrice?
18|When exactly do you get to see your sisters naked?
18|Let's see...
18|Usually when I strip them naked.
18|Forget the trial, you deserve execution!
18|Officer! Listen to me!
18|Scene no. 331
18|Come on.
18|Let's get this cleaned up.
18|I see.
18|You had it tough.
18|It probably wasn't easy on you.
18|Actually, it wasn't that...
18|It wasn't easy on you, period.
18|You're way too hard on yourself, both in a good way and a bad one.
18|I would have given up halfway.
18|I actually thought I was emulating you.
18|Didn't I tell you?
18|You hold me in too high esteem.
18|You're a much more amazing person than I am.
18|Oh, right.
18|Araragi, I have something to ask of you.
18|I recovered more mummified devil pieces from Numachi.
18|I have trouble getting rid of them.
18|Can you take them for me?
18|Sure.
18|What do you want me to do with them?
18|Treat Shinobu to a snack.
18|Oh, yeah.
18|That's a pretty failsafe way of getting rid of them.
18|But isn't that thing a valuable cultural artifact?
18|Every story must end somewhere.
18|There's nothing sweeter than schadenfreude, huh?
18|I don't really understand a view like that.
18|Just hearing about schadenfreude pisses me off.
18|Yeah, I figured it would.
18|There are very few as unfortunate as you.
18|Nonsense.
18|I'm the luckiest guy on Earth.
18|Hear, hear.
18|So how about this.
18|If you could wish for anything, what would you wish for?
18|That's hard.
18|I have so many wishes, picking one is difficult.
18|I guess most people are like that.
18|I guess I could wish for this:
18|I wish Karen and I weren't blood-rel—
18|That one is out of the question!
18|Sibling
18|Scene no. 356
18|Then again, if she's not my sibling, there's no bling, either.
18|Maybe she could be my stepsister?
18|Actually, it feels like with my stepsister I'd be exploiting a loophole in the law, so that'd give me a pang of conscience.
18|No, I want her to be my full, blood-related sister!
18|So then...
18|Let's see...
18|Maybe the law could change for me.
18|Should I be worried about Karen?
18|Why should you?
18|Karen will be fine.
18|I'll look after her all my life.
18|Besides, it doesn't matter whether wishes come true or not.
18|You're the one who makes your wishes come true, so maybe you can't make them come true,
18|but I believe wishing for something in and of itself already has merit.
18|Wishing for something in and of itself?
18|Yeah.
18|Regardless of whether or not it's possible to make it come true,
18|I think it's good to understand yourself and what you wish for.
18|If you don't know what you want to be like and what you'd like to see happen,
18|your life will be filled with doubt.
18|I wonder if she gave me the Monkey's Paw for that reason.
18|She?
18|You mean your mother?
18|Maybe...
18|Actually, I don't know.
18|I don't think kids will ever understand their parents.
18|Are you sure about this?
18|Yeah.
18|Scythe it off.
18|What a waste.
18|I like this hairstyle.
18|Yeah.
18|I really like it as well,
18|but it gets in the way during sports.
18|Oh man.
18|You're the third girl whose hair I'm cutting.
18|You player—
18|I suppose I'm half-decent at this sort of thing,
18|but don't you have a hairdresser you frequent?
18|I do...
18|But I want you to cut it.
18|Why?
18|It's my policy.
18|Right, Araragi.
18|Can you give me a lift one of these days?
18|Sure.
18|Where to?
18|I'd like to visit Numachi's grave.
18|Okay, let's ask Tsukihi to look up where it is.
18|I'd like to see Numachi's dying wish through and gather the other half of the devil,
18|but I doubt I'll be able to put that plan into action.
18|You don't have to.
18|You don't have to bear the load alone.
18|Keeping the devil split into many parts is safer to begin with.
18|Let's do this.

18|Many people will have lots of different opinions on what you did.
18|There will be those who will say you did the right thing,
18|and those who will say you were wrong.
18|You shouldn't pay attention to them.
18|Don't worry about what they'll say.

18|and suddenly my loneliness is lit up
18|On the waterside I see the summer haze
18|One day it will be gone like the flowers
18|I'm afflicted by incurable sadness
18|I made up an excuse to keep others at bay

19|creatures not human
19|beyond our understanding
19|Monsters beyond human understanding.
19|Saying that I was simply unlucky,
19|would be horribly irresponsible,
19|and maybe I should just honestly admit it was my fault.
19|During spring break between his second and third year of high school,
19|Araragi Koyomi was attacked by one such oddity.
19|A monster beautiful enough to make one's blood curl.
19|At the climax of a story where scars were shared,
19|one that spanned two nightmarish weeks,
19|I had no friends. Not a single one.
19|I do not mean that I was bullied.
19|Senjougahara was reading in the corner of the classroom,
19|with an expression as if it was perfectly natural.
19|She was building a wall around me.

19|Of the nine-day period that glitters like gold,
19|and the events that unfolded then.
19|Let's recall the events of that ominous Golden Week that I spent flirting with Hanekawa Tsubasa to my heart's content. They are bitter memories, they are sour memories, but somewhere deep down there's sweetness to be found. Let's recall the events of those nine golden days, events that I want to forget if possible, and even if not, I want to undo them. Timewise, it was during the two weeks of my spring break between my second and third years in high school, during the month I experienced hell itself; it was such a time. She was bewitched by a cat. A cat. A felid, a carnivore, a mammal. Ever since, I can't stand cats. I'm afraid of cats. Yes, just as I'm afraid of Hanekawa Tsubasa. Now please let me tell you about a dream I saw last night.
19|29th April, Saturday, morning
19|What the hell did you go back to sleep for?
19|Die.
19|Araragi
19|Tsukihi! What on earth are you doing?!
19|You trying to kill me?!
19|A brother who'd fall asleep after that is better off dead.
19|Karen and I woke you up, yet you go back to sleep. It's unfathomable.
19|You should just drop dead.
19|You should just drop dead!
19|What's with this drastic change in personality?!
19|I don't stand out much compared to the others,
19|so I wanted to try out being a sadist.
19|That was more of a lunatic than a sadist!
19|Golden Week starts today, huh?
19|There's not a single good thing about it.
19|You're being quite pessimistic on the very first day, aren't you?
19|Not even nine hours have passed since Golden Week began, y'know.
19|Oh, right.
19|Let's have a discussion about love, Tsukihi.
19|Love?
19|Inside the darkness
19|my love softly blossomed
19|like a flower for the first time
19|I'm sure you don't realize it
19|You held out your hand to me
19|and although I found no strength to take it
19|I want you to hold it out to me
19|for just a while longer

19|So what kind of love did you want to talk about?
19|You're in middle school and have a boyfriend already,
19|and your friends likely ask you, a veteran, for advice on various love-related issues,
19|so this is something I can only ask you about.
19|There's a girl in my class who I'm interested in.
19|I might have feelings for a girl who ended up in the same class as me.
19|Oh, wow!
19|Is it that surprising?
19|Of course it is!
19|Surprising? More like earth-shattering, if you ask me!
19|My brother, who used to make ridiculous declarations like,
19|"The more friends you have, the weaker you are as a person" is in love now?!
19|This is more shocking to me than a talking dog!
19|Don't get ahead of yourself.
19|I only said that I might, perhaps, be interested in her. It's not set in stone.
19|That's why I'm here, unwillingly asking you for advice.
19|Let's say there's a member of the opposite sex.
19|How do you figure out if you're in love with them?
19|Scene no. 51
19|Er, what?
19|Could you repeat that?
19|You didn't catch that?
19|Pay attention this time.

19|Er... I can't really go into specifics, but—
19|Scene no. 65
19|Let's call the subject Miss H, for the time being.
19|Miss H? Awfully specific, aren't we?
19|Ever since we ended up in the same class at the beginning of the month,
19|Flash back
19|she's all I've been thinking about.
19|And it's not just thinking, either.
19|During class, whenever I take my eyes off the blackboard,
19|I always find myself looking in her direction.
19|And it's not just in school, either.
19|I look for her on my way to school and back, too.
19|Even when I go shopping to, let's say, to the bookstore,
19|A bookstore the grade of the Diet's library
19|Cafe Books Parking
19|there's a part of me that hopes we'll run into each other

19|Reading the book I bought at that bookstore makes me think,
19|"Oh, I bet she'd like this part," and so on.
19|Then His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness said to the old man: "If this be thy daughter, wilt thou offer her to me?" He replied, saying: "With reverence, but I know not thy august name." Then be replied, saying: I am elder brother to the Heaven-Shining-Great-August deity. So I hath now descended from Heaven." Then the deities Foot-Stroking-Elder and Hand-Stroking-Elder said: "If that be so, with reverence will we offer her to thee." So His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness, at once taking and changing, the young girl into a multitudinous and close-toothed comb which he stuck into his august hair-bunch, said to the deities Foot-Stroking-Elder and Hand-Stroking-Elder: "Do you distil some eightfold refined liquor? Also make a fence round about, in that fence make eight gates, at each gate tie together eight platforms, on each platform put a liquor-vat, and into each vat pour the eightfold refined liquor, and wait." So as they waited after having thus prepared everything in accordance with his bidding the eight-forked serpent came truly as the old man had said, and immediately dipped a head into each vat, and drank the liquor. Thereupon it was intoxicated with drinking, and all the heads lay down and slept. Then His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness drew the ten-grasp saber that was augustly girded on him, and cut the serpent in pieces, so that the River Hi flowed on changed into a river of blood. So when he cut the middle tail, the edge of his august sword broke. Then, thinking it strange, he thrust into and split the flesh with the point of his august sword and looked, and there was a great sword within. So he took this great sword, and, thinking it a strange thing, he respectfully informed the Heaven-Shining-Great-August deity. This was the Herb-Quelling Great Sword. So thereupon His Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness sought in the land of Idzumo for a place where he might build a palace. Then he arrived at a place called Suga, and said: "On coming to this place my august heart is pure," and in that place he built a palace to dwell in. So that place is now called Suga. When this great deity, first built the palace of Suga, clouds rose up thence. Then he made an august song. That song said: "Eight clouds arise. The eightfold fence of Idzumo makes an eightfold fence for the spouses to retire within. Oh, that eightfold fence." Then he called the Deity Foot-Stroking-Elder and said: "Thee do I appoint Headman of my palace," and moreover bestowed on him the name of Master-of-the-Temple-of-Inada-Eight-Eared-Deity-of-Suga. And again, having wedded the Divine-Princess-of-Great-Majesty, daughter of the Deity Great-Mountain-Possessor, he begot children: the Great-Harvest Deity and the August-Spirit-of-Food. The elder brother, the Deity Eight-Island-Ruler wedded Princess-Falling-Like-the-Flowers-of-the-Trees, daughter of the Deity Great-Mountain-Possessor, and
19|I'd think about buying a porn magazine,
19|but then immediately put it back on the shelf,
19|because I'd be afraid she'd come to hate me if I bought it.
19|You don't have to be so frank about it.
19|That's way too much personal information.
19|More like, do you really think I want to hear about you hesitating to buy porn?
19|Actually, Bro...
19|What?
19|That's love, isn't it?
19|You never know.
19|I've never even fallen in love with someone in the first place.
19|Never?!

19|I figured I'd use your case as a reference.
19|Your boyfriend... Rousokuzawa, was it?
19|I'm surprised you remember.
19|Just his name, though.
19|When, at what stage, did you conclude you were in love with him?
19|That's what I really wanted to ask you about.
19|Well, I did,
19|somehow.
19|Somehow?
19|Yup. Ambiguously. Vaguely.
19|Is that okay?
19|It is. It is what it is.
19|Okay, then let's leave the timing part aside for now and focus on the reason.
19|Scene no. 104
19|Why did you fall in love with Rousokuzawa?
19|One reason or another.
19|I really just did.
19|Somehow
19|Somehow, for one reason or another, I just did.
19|Somehow
19|I wondered if I loved him, if I felt I did, and if I realized I did.
19|Something like that.
19|How vague could you possibly get?
19|The same goes for the reasons as well.
19|You could make up loads of excuses like how he's so cool, he's nice, tall, rich, or whatever.
19|You can come up with reasons like that,
19|but they're all just lies.
19|Lies you say to try to justify your feelings.
19|Pretense, in other words. In the end, they're just excuses.
19|You begin by concluding that you're in love, then climb the ladder to reach that conclusion.
19|A ladder?
19|Maybe a rocket would be more fitting given the situation.
19|Yeah, it's like building a rocket.
19|I think you're pretty much in love if you always want to be with someone.
19|I see.
19|Then I, Araragi Koyomi, might just have finally fallen in love at the ripe old age of eighteen.
19|Why stop at "might have"? Believe that you have.

19|Yes. No uncertainty about it!
19|I hereby declare that you're in love with Miss H.
19|Well, if that's your decision, there's not much I can do about it. Yep.
19|All right! I no longer have any doubts!
19|You have my gratitude. Thank you, Tsukihi.
19|Scene no. 133
19|No, no, no. It was a big deal, but then it wasn't, really.
19|Well, I said quite a lot, but if you take anything away from this...
19|Know that falling in love with someone is as ordinary as a dog barking,
19|so it's not worth worrying about so much.
19|I see. Ordinary, eh?
19|Yup. Completely normal.
19|It's normal to be interested in a girl in your class.
19|Normal!
19|Paying more attention to her than the blackboard during a class is normal too.
19|Normal!
19|As is looking for her on the way to school and back,
19|wondering if you'll run into her,
19|and letting your imagination run wild when purchasing a book!
19|Normal!
19|The same goes for wanting to fondle her breasts, too!
19|Nope.
19|What on earth are you talking about, Tsukihi?
19|You mean little old me?
19|Time for you to kneel, too.
19|Okay. Got it.
19|Scene no. 152
19|What I'm saying is,
19|Miss H has breasts appealing enough to make one want to cop a feel,
19|or fondle them.
19|What I'm saying is, Miss H has a chest attractive enough to
19|That's where we're at right now.
19|I'm sorry, but could you please stop using such lewd terminology?
19|Hmm?
19|Okay, then how about touch gently?
19|Well okay, that's not lewd and even sounds kind of cute, but—
19|Anyway, the long and short of it is
19|that I keep wanting to gently touch Miss H's breasts.
19|This is what you call love, right?
19|Nope.
19|But think about it this way.
19|You wouldn't want to touch the breasts of a girl you don't love, would you?
19|That's why I believe these feelings of mine are definitely what you'd call love.
19|A boy wanting to touch a girl's breasts is natural, so you shouldn't overthink it.
19|Sheesh.
19|Sheesh, sheesh.
19|What?
19|I figured we'd try it out.
19|Here, cop a feel.
19|Okay.
19|Scene no. 176
19|It hurts, dammit!
19|I said it hurts! Let go! Let go this very instant!
19|Ah, geez.
19|You went too far fondling your sister's breasts like that!
19|What were you even expecting?
19|Where did you think this was gonna go
19|when you stuck your breasts out at me?
19|It was both a joke and test of sorts.
19|In my head,
19|I foresaw us engaging back and forth, with you
19|trying to prove your theory right by saying you had no interest in breasts like these,
19|and me pointing out that it's only because they're your sister's.
19|Would've made for a great scene, but you blew it.
19|So what now?
19|What do you mean?
19|What conclusion do we derive from that test or whatever it was?
19|Er...
19|Aren't you just sexually frustrated?
19|What?!
19|Come to think of it,
19|didn't say that you couldn't buy porn magazines, you couldn't buy porn magazines,
19|and that you couldn't buy porn magazines earlier?
19|I didn't say it thrice.
19|That completely backfired on you.
19|You mistook your libido for feelings of love,
19|and now you're caught in an inflationary spiral of sexual frustration.
19|Holy crap. An inflationary spiral?
19|You're saying that a James Bond-like phenomenon is now occurring inside my head?
19|Yup. That's why you end up indiscriminately touching even your sister's chest.
19|I did end up touching it, huh?
19|That touch panel-like chest of yours.
19|Aren't touch panels flat surfaces?!
19|I see. I'm sexually frustrated, huh?
19|But yeah, that's quite a convincing argument, now that I think about it.
19|Actually, I get the feeling that's exactly what's going on here.
19|Scene no. 212
19|I get it now. So that's what was happening to me.
19|Yeah. That was a close one, wasn't it?
19|You nearly mistook finding someone's breasts appealing for falling in love with someone you don't even like.
19|Oh man.
19|This is what all of them mean when they say, "D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay?" Right?
19|Looking at it from Miss H's point of view in this case, that'd be a very serious request.
19|Either way, now that we've reached a conclusion, we'd better come up with some countermeasures.
19|Scene no. 223
19|This could end up becoming a disaster if we neglect it.
19|Scene no. 223
19|We must protect Miss H from my demonic hands.
19|Scene no. 224
19|I suppose I could settle for clearing my head by fondling you or Karen whenever I feel like it.
19|That's not something that can be put into practice!
19|What, aren't you Fire Sisters the warriors of justice?
19|You should gladly sacrifice yourselves for me, then.
19|I get the feeling that sacrificing you is the only way to administer justice in this case.
19|There's no way I'm letting you fondle my breasts for such a dumb reason.
19|What do we do, then?
19|Well, I suppose you don't have a choice...
19|Go buy a porn magazine.
19|Scene no. 234
19|I mean, you hesitated to buy them this past month because you've been worried Miss H would judge you for it.
19|And considering it's you we're talking about here,
19|you probably threw away the prized collection you built up over time just to cleanse your body and mind, right?
19|How did you know that?!
19|That's just increasing your pent up frustration.
19|So you should just solve that problem by purchasing a new porn magazine.
19|Now that we've come to an agreement, go strike while the iron's hot!
19|The bookstore should be opening right about now too, so go buy some.
19|I'm home!
19|Welcome back.
19|What, is it raining?
19|And I was just about to go out, too.
19|No, it isn't raining.
19|It's weather appropriate for the first day of Golden Week, clear blue skies.
19|Why are you so drenched, then?
19|Oh, this is just sweat.
19|That's all sweat?
19|Are you serious?
19|Well, you see, I don't go jogging too often, so I'm not accustomed to pacing myself.
19|Apparently, I got it completely wrong this time.
19|I didn't expect 42.195 kilometers to be all that far.
19|Did you just run a full marathon?!
19|I went jogging today to commemorate the start of Golden Week, so I imagined myself as an Olympic torchbearer.
19|Olympic torchbearers don't run 42.195 kilometers!
19|Man, I'm beat.
19|Thirsty as hell too. I need some water!
19|Guess I'll take a shower now.
19|Hey, Karen.
19|What is it?
19|I want you to enlighten me on something.
19|Do you finally feel inclined to take up the way of karate?
19|No, I don't want you to teach me your secret technique.
19|How do you figure out if you're in love, if you love someone?
19|Huh? It's love advice you're looking for?
19|If looking at their face makes you want to have their babies,
19|you're in love with them. It's that simple.
19|Scene no. 278
19|Yo, Araragi!
19|You doin' all right?
19|Yo! I'm doing all right, yes.
19|Scene no. 297
19|Er,
19|Scene no. 300
19|you see, Ararag—
19|What's a high schooler like you thinking, flipping skirts at this age?
19|You know, Hanekawa...
19|Don't worry, I know.
19|Here.
19|You're kind, Araragi.
19|You're kind, and you're a nice guy.
19|That's what I like about you.
19|Let's take a walk.
19|You have younger sisters, don't you?
19|Yeah,
19|but it wouldn't make a difference if I didn't.
19|It wouldn't make a difference?
19|Having said that, they're my family, so it's not like we're on bad terms.
19|But they really are causing me tons of trouble.
19|Although, I guess there have been times when I've been the instigator.
19|So you're sailing in the same boat?
19|Well, isn't that nice. It's almost like a family.
19|Family?
19|Right. A familie.
19|Did I ever tell you I was an only child?
19|No, I don't think you did.
19|You see, Araragi...
19|I don't have what you'd call a family.
19|Easy there, Hanekawa.
19|You might not have siblings sure, but aren't you going a bit too far by saying you don't have a family?
19|You probably have a dad, a mom, grandparents—
19|I don't.
19|I don't have a dad, a mom, or anyone else for that matter.
19|Basically, my biological mother's husband's second wife is my current mother,
19|and her second husband's my current father.
19|So they're not your biological parents?
19|Right. The dad and mom I'm living with right now aren't related to me by blood at all. They're complete strangers.
19|No kindred of mine, if you will.
19|"They're not related to me by blood, so they're no kindred of mine"?
19|Sounds like the kind of thing that'd make a vampire laugh, doesn't it?
19|Not at all.
19|I used to think it was possible to become a family even if you weren't blood-related.
19|I used to think I had to try my best to get along well with them.
19|But things just didn't go my way.
19|Things don't go my way, and they're much too tedious.
19|That bruise on your face...
19|Who did that to you?
19|Why? Why would you, Araragi, ask me that question?
19|That's...
19|That's probably because I'm your friend.
19|Friend...
19|Wouldn't a friend usually ask questions in these kinds of situations?
19|I'm not really sure, though.
19|Hmm, yeah. You're right. You're probably right.
19|Do you promise not to tell anyone?
19|Well, oka—
19|When I say anyone, I mean anyone.
19|Not your sisters, nor anyone else in your family.
19|Will you keep it a secret from everyone?
19|I... promise.
19|My dad hit me this morning.
19|You got hit? That's—
19|Just put yourself in his shoes for a second, Araragi.
19|You're forty years old,
19|and you have to put up with an ignorant seventeen year old talking to you like she knows everything.
19|Don't you think it's inevitable that you'd get a little mad and maybe snap?
19|Why does it sound like she's trying to justify what happened?
19|She's sticking up for someone who's not her real parent—
19|A parent who'd hit his daughter.
19|She's my friend, but with the way she's acting right now, I find her...
19|Scene no. 373
19|revolting.
19|"It was inevitable that he'd hit you"? What the hell are you talking about?!
19|Should you really be saying that? Isn't that what you should find most unforgiv—
19|Isn't it okay, just this once?
19|You promised, didn't you, Araragi?
19|You promised, didn't you, Araragi?!
19|You promised not to tell anyone, didn't you?
19|But that's not a promise I can keep—
19|Please, Araragi!
19|Don't tell anyone about this.
19|Hanekawa...
19|But I...
19|Please don't tell anyone.
19|If you keep this a secret, I'll do anything you want!
19|What? For real?! You'll do anything?!
19|Fuck yeah!
19|A-Araragi?
19|Oh man, what should I do?
19|H—
19|What should I have her do? What should I have her do?!
19|H—
19|What'd be the best thing I could have her do?
19|Hu—
19|No!
19|Hu—
19|Wait, hold on! Don't panic!
19|Hu—
19|Don't get too worked up! This is the time to be calm and collected!
19|Hu—
19|Go about it in a dignified manner!
19|Hu—
19|I have to utilize this unprecedented opportunity to the fullest.
19|H-Huh?
19|Is that how you react?
19|Is this supposed to be that kind of scene?
19|Isn't it one where you're touched by my sincerity and reluctantly swear eternal silence?
19|Sincerity? The heck is that? I have no idea!
19|Scene no. 412
19|Anything, eh?
19|Scene no. 413
19|But now that it's come to this, I really don't know what I should pick.
19|Scene no. 414
19|Shit! My indecisiveness is starting to piss me off.
19|Come on! It's at times like these where making a prompt decision makes you a man among men.
19|No, it'd make you the worst kind of man.
19|Hey, Araragi. Do you remember that serious and heavy topic we were discussing just a minute ago?
19|I don't.
19|You don't, huh?
19|Araragi? Who's that supposed to be?
19|So you even forgot your own name.
19|She'll do anything, eh?
19|But really, what on earth should I have her do?
19|This is an extremely difficult decision to make, simply because there are way too many options to pick from!
19|Actually wait, this is more like a short essay!
19|What I need right now is composition skills!
19|Hold on!
19|Come to think of it, Hanekawa hasn't placed any restrictions on the number of wishes she'll grant me.
19|So her words, depending on how you take them, might just mean she's willing to forever do as I say!
19|Just one!
19|I'll do whatever you want me to, but only once.
19|Damn, I let her add that clause.
19|I'm starting to get a headache here, seriously.
19|For the time being, Hanekawa, let's head to a more secluded place.
19|All right, fine. I understand.
19|Not like I have anywhere else to be.
19|I took Hanekawa to a nearby thicket.
19|What's with you, Araragi?
19|You're really beating around the bush here.
19|Or maybe it's because you can't think of anything?
19|Or maybe, perhaps, what you want to do is stare a hole through me like you are right now?
19|What do they call it... ogling?
19|Hanekawa.
19|What?
19|That's not what I want to do.
19|I...
19|What I want to do is lick a hole through
19|the bruise that's under that bandage!
19|As I still have lingering side-effects from when I was a vampire,
19|my blood and saliva have healing abilities.
19|As a scaredy-cat who didn't have the balls to lick Hanekawa's face,
19|I instead pricked my fingertip with a safety pin and applied my blood on her bruise.
19|It was a perfectly wholesome act.
19|Thank you.
19|Put that bandage back on, just in case.
19|People might find it weird that your bruise healed that quickly.
19|Do you think my parents would find it suspicious?
19|They wouldn't.
19|They're not the kind of people who would.
19|I could chop my hair off, but I don't think they'd notice that I did.
19|They probably don't even remember my face.
19|Oh, hey.
19|That was quick!
19|Don't just ignore me like that.
19|At least open your mouth and tell your cute little sister that you're home.
19|Are you done shopping?
19|Shopping?
19|No, shopping...
19|was a lie.
19|Screw dealing with my pent up frustration. I've only ended up getting more depressed.
19|These feelings, thoughts, and desires...
19|only continue to bury me.
20|Scene no. 1
20|No entry
20|You don't have to glare like that.
20|It ruins your beautiful face.
20|Come on, give me a smile.
20|That's what suits you best.
20|You could at least act like you appreciate it.
20|Huh?
20|Er...
20|This can't be happening.
20|Sure, she might be a dried up remnant, a mere shadow of her former self,
20|but this is still a proud vampire we're talking about here.
20|And there's absolutely no way she'd find donuts irresistible.
20|Don't go destroying my hopes and dreams!
20|A-Are you okay?
20|Oh, right.
20|Scene no. 52
20|Scene no. 53
20|Scene no. 56
20|Scene no. 57
20|Scene no. 58
20|Not so fast!
20|Stay!
20|Unnumbered scene
20|Scene no. 67
20|Paw.
20|Good. Now eat.
20|Wait, I got these for Oshino.
20|I get the feeling I'm being pressured here.
20|Scene no. 74
20|Though, well, it could be my guilt that's threatening to crush me under its weight right now.
20|Because I'm the reason this little vampire's been forced into a lifestyle like this.
20|Ever since spring break, she hasn't said a thing.
20|She frequently had a smile on her face back then, but all she wears now is a sour, sullen expression.
20|I'm fully aware that I shouldn't feel any compassion for her, not even the bare minimum,
20|considering what she did and what she's done all her life, but...
20|All right, fine.
20|I'll let you have them all.
20|You'll have to do a 1080 and bark like a dog, though.
20|So she still won't talk, huh?
20|Eat.
20|Wonderful. These circular snacks are seriously scrumptious!
20|This is truly a jewelry box of sweet, sweet rings.
20|Did you just speak?!
20|So I was just hearing things...
20|The heck are you doing, Araragi?
20|You shouldn't bully Ms. Vampire too much.
20|You might come to regret it.
20|I'm not bullying her.
20|More importantly, this has been bothering me ever since spring break.
20|Hasn't she become a lot more childish mentally as well?
20|Yeah. That was bound to happen, Araragi.
20|And not just because she's a vampire, either.
20|Oddities are creatures built from the ground up by human beliefs.
20|Human beliefs?
20|Right. They exist because humans believe they do.
20|That's what an Oddity is.
20|They're shaped by their environment's awareness of them,
20|and their behavior matches its expectations.
20|That's how it works.
20|Now then, as for Ms. Vampire here...
20|At the moment, you're the only entity aware of her existence.
20|Strictly speaking, I suppose both Ms. Class Rep and I are also aware.
20|Nevertheless, the one that exerts the most influence on her
20|is you, Araragi.
20|I have to admit that there might be a part of me that sees her as an eight year old.
20|Still,
20|you can't possibly tell me that this scene mirrors my expectations.
20|It's not like every kid grows up the way their parents would like them to.
20|However, the hopes of their parents affect them at least a little.
20|This is somewhat similar to that.
20|A parent's hopes...
20|The household effect...
20|I'm not gonna preach to you about how you should become a better human being,
20|but screw around too much and your influence could end up becoming negative.
20|Considering...
20|Considering I've already brought that proud vampire down to this innocent child-like state,
20|the least I could do is not make things worse for her.
20|That's what it boils down to.
20|Unnumbered scene
20|That aside, Araragi.
20|I brought her up earlier, so I guess I might as well ask. How's Ms. Class Rep doing?
20|What do you mean? She's fine.
20|Really?
20|I see. You can't say.
20|Which means
20|something happened to her that you can't talk to me about.
20|That worries me.
20|It's not something to concern yourself with.
20|It's Hanekawa's problem to deal with, so I can't be too meddlesome.
20|Even if something did happen, she'd have to save herself.
20|If not, she'd be beyond help. Right?
20|Hmm, I see. I won't press you any further, then.
20|Let's look at it the other way around.
20|Tell me what you can.
20|It's not like you're forbidden from ever speaking about her, right?
20|Scene no. 166
20|I told him about today's events while cleverly... Or maybe not. Omitting the things I was forbidden from saying.
20|Scene no. 167
20|Starting from this morning, when I was woken up by my little sister,
20|Scene no. 170
20|up to my chance encounter with Hanekawa.
20|And lastly, what happened afterwards.
20|Time passes
20|Scene no. 172
20|Help
20|Scene no. 181
20|Scene no. 182
20|Araragi, please don't tell me
20|that it was a silver cat without a tail.
20|Scene no. 218
20|Unnumbered scene
20|Scene no. 219
20|Scene no. 220
20|The Curse Cat.
20|Scene no. 225
20|Order Carnivora. Family Felidae. Mammal.
20|It's one of the Oddities I'm collecting in this town.
20|Hold on a second, Oshino.
20|The cat Hanekawa and I buried wasn't an Oddity.
20|It actually existed.
20|Yeah, there's no way.
20|That's what I'd think too...
20|Under normal circumstances.
20|However, Araragi. Ms. Class Rep is anything but normal.
20|She's seriously dangerous.
20|Burying a cat that was run over is a trivial, commonplace occurrence.
20|You could even call it heartwarming.
20|Even something that simple could become an earth-shattering incident just because she's involved.
20|The fact that it was a cat in particular makes things even worse.
20|Hmm?
20|The Curse Cat is way too perfect a fit for Ms. Class Rep.
20|What should I do then, Oshino?
20|The fastest way to do things here would be to split up.
20|I'll go exhume the white cat you buried.
20|So all I need to do is tell you where we buried it?
20|In return, I'll have you shoulder a different, more important responsibility.
20|Huh?
20|Like I said, we'll split up.
20|I'll have you contact Ms. Class Rep directly.
20|D-Directly?
20|You're going to visit her place, and confirm that she's safe by actually seeing her.
20|Talk to her,
20|and pay close attention to her eyes when you do.
20|A lone home call
20|Good grief. This has spiraled out of control.
20|Actually, how am I even supposed to meet Hanekawa at this hour?
20|Out of bounds
20|1
20|Hanekawa?
20|Huh? But wait...
20|Is that Hanekawa?
20|Meow!
20|Meow.
20|Ha-Hanekawa...
20|Who're you? A friend of my master's, purrhaps?
20|Come to think of it, I do get the impurrsion I've seen you before.
20|You're the guy who was with her when she purried me, aren't you?
20|This is a pawsitive sign.
20|I'm not sure I furry understand it, but friends are supposed to help each other out, right?
20|So clean this mess up fur her, yeah?
20|Unnumbered scene
20|Err, what would you call it meow?
20|Oh, right.
20|Those are appurrently my master's parents,
20|I think.
20|Feel free to dispose of them using any method you purrfer.
20|You could even kill them,
20|fur all I care.
20|Hey! Wait a second, Hanekawa!
20|Wait for what?
20|Don't think my master will listen to every pussible request of yours, fool!
20|She's in this state beclaws you're all like that!
20|Unnumbered scene
20|Ow!
20|Don't cry over spilled milk.
20|Compared to the agony my master's endured fur such a long time,
20|the amount of pain you're in now is nothing!
20|By master...
20|Does she mean Hanekawa?
20|Yeah. That's right, human.
20|She has me meow, so she doesn't need you anymore.
20|She doesn't need parents, friends,
20|or even herself.
20|What?
20|I'll set my master free. Grant her lipurrty far surpassing anyone else.
20|The lot of you couldn't do that fur her.
20|All you could do was chain her down and cause problems fur her.
20|Unnumbered scene
20|Furst things furst,
20|I'll release her from the enormous stress she's under.
20|Hanekawa...
20|Scene no. 373
20|Scene no. 374
20|Scene no. 387
20|The first thing I did after the Curse Cat left was sort out the chaotic state of affairs.
20|I called for an ambulance.
20|As for that residential area street I covered in a pool of my own blood,
20|I'd normally need a deck brush and a whole lot of water to clean up that mess.
20|However, all signs of my blood had evaporated without me having to do a thing.
20|Of course, I didn't find that strange at all...
20|It was something I'd grown tired of seeing during spring break.
20|Unnumbered scene
20|What I should have found strange though, was that my blood took much longer than usual to evaporate.
20|Unnumbered scene
20|W-Woah!
20|You awake, Araragi?
20|Quite the sleepyhead, aren't we?
20|I got tired of waiting.
20|Look, it's almost sunset.
20|I was asleep for more than twelve hours?
20|I thought you were gonna die.
20|Hey, Oshino! Hanekawa's—
20|Yeah, I know.
20|I heard about it already.
20|Ms. Class Rep turned into a cat, right?
20|Looks like our worst fears came true.
20|You can go now, Ms. Vampire.
20|What was that all about?
20|Why was she even awake at this hour?
20|Well, your injuries were much too severe,
20|so I had her help out a little.
20|Take a look.
20|The two of you have a really strong link,
20|and the same goes for your healing abilities as well.
20|They're more effective the closer you are to each other.
20|Make sure you thank her later.
20|I was really surprised though.
20|I thought I'd heal much more quickly given that she drank my blood not long before it happened.
20|Nah. Your immortality should currently be able to take care of most serious injuries.
20|Everything but a fatal wound should heal in an instant.
20|In this case, though,
20|you just picked the wrong opponent.
20|Well, it has less to do with your opponent and more with the match up.
20|It was a bad matchup.
20|The Curse Cat is bad news.
20|B-Bad news?
20|There's more to the wounds inflicted by its curse,
20|its caress, than the damage it causes you.
20|As they say, it's best to let sleeping cats lie. Don't touch them.
20|Araragi, are you familiar with the concept of an Energy Drain?
20|Energy Drain?
20|Wait, isn't that supposed to be a vampire's specialty?
20|That's exactly right.
20|However, that doesn't mean it's exclusive to vampires.
20|So what you're trying to say, basically, is that my immortality got torn off along with my left arm?
20|You're done for if you let the Curse Cat touch you.
20|That's why it's named the Curse Cat, huh?
20|Either way, an Energy Drain that overpowers a vampire's immortality is quite the threat.
20|Not really, no.
20|Maybe I worded it wrong, Araragi.
20|When I said matchup, I meant how it matched up with you personally,
20|not that the Curse Cat and a vampire had equivalent power.
20|Huh?
20|Vampires are the Kings of Oddities.
20|Emperors. Monarchs.
20|The Curse Cat might have the ability to use Energy Drain, but not one nearly as powerful.
20|To a vampire, the Curse Cat is just a weakling.
20|Weakling?
20|Not much time had passed since you let Ms. Vampire drink your blood,
20|so you probably were, to some degree, a vampire at the time.
20|But at the end of the day? You're human.
20|You don't stand a chance against a real Oddity.
20|A real Oddity...
20|I tried digging up that grave you told me about, but I didn't find anything buried.
20|The situation has absolutely taken a turn for the worse.
20|I see.
20|That said, your wound appears to be healing well.
20|Doesn't look like it's been fully attached on the inside, but you should be fine by tomorrow at this rate.
20|Ms. Vampire is probably asleep by now, so you better thank her next time.
20|Well, it's quite obvious that she'd gladly attend to you for one afternoon,
20|considering it'd cause her huge problems if you died.
20|That's something I'm happy to hear, though.
20|That she needs me as a source of nutrition proves that she is,
20|at the very least, trying to stay alive.
20|That's not really what I meant, though.
20|You thickheaded idiot.
20|Huh?
20|Anyway, Araragi. Go home before your family starts to worry...
20|Huh?
20|The cellphone in your pocket seemed to be shaking like crazy.
20|What's the word, vibrating?
20|They're probably all from Karen and Tsukihi.
20|Unlike Ms. Class Rep, you have a family that'd worry about you,
20|so you'd better go home now, Araragi.
20|Enough, Oshino.
20|This injury doesn't change anything.
20|I can't just run home knowing Hanekawa's going through such a thing.
20|It's far too late for that.
20|Time to leave it to the pros.
20|Not to an amateur, and definitely not to a minor.
20|It might not be obvious due to my frivolous nature,
20|but I really am sorry I got you so badly injured.
20|I'm a failure as a Balancer.
20|I disregarded the textbook course of action and did something that went against my policy.
20|My lapse in judgment was the main reason you got put in harm's way.
20|I can't apologize enough to your family.
20|You've done more than enough, Araragi.
20|Araragi Koyomi,
20|there isn't a single thing you can do from here on out.
20|You can't help Ms. Class Rep in any way whatsoever.
20|You might want to, but you can't.
20|It's not a matter of how you feel about it,
20|but one of skill and ability.
20|Let me make it absolutely clear.
20|It's your responsibility, and your job,
20|to make sure you don't get in my way.
21|Scene no. 1
21|Isn't this Hanekawa's room?
21|Oh, welcome ba—
21|Whoa?!
21|There were six rooms in the Hanekawa household.
21|However, none of them, not a single one of them belonged to Hanekawa Tsubasa.
21|She's done for.
21|Nothing's going to come of it.
21|It's beyond repair.
21|Completely beyond reason.
21|That home,
21|that household,
21|that family,
21|is completely done for.
21|Geez, you're so hopeless.
21|There, there. You must've been really scared.
21|All right. Go ahead.
21|Gross!
21|Is that how you respond to your sister's devotion?!
21|I'm taking disciplinary action!
21|Just how impulsive can you two get?!
21|It's in our genes! Like brother, like sisters!
21|I have to say I was really worried.
21|You took so long to come home,
21|Karen and I were worried you'd run into a monster or something.
21|A monster?
21|To be more specific, a monster cat.
21|Monster cat...
21|Yup.
21|It's only a rumor, so I don't know how much of it is true,
21|but there's apparently a monster cat attacking people all over town.
21|Scene no. 110
21|How long ago was that?
21|I heard it through the grapevine this afternoon.
21|Then I got really worried and went nuts trying to call you.
21|I'm glad you're safe and all,
21|but as avatars of justice, the Fire Sisters can't just stay quiet about the situation at this point.
21|Karen's been making preparations to go monster cat-hunting as we speak.
21|No...
21|Hmm? What's wrong?
21|What do you mean, no?
21|No, well,
21|I was just thinking about how I'm in a tight spot.
21|Riding my bike home at night was scary enough, and to make things worse,
21|you just told me a really scary story involving a monster cat.
21|Now, I'm so terrified I can't even go to sleep alone.
21|I was thinking I'd ask you and Karen to sleep with me for the next few days,
21|but if you two have to leave in order to fight for justice,
21|I guess I'm on my own, even if you're the only ones I can rely on.
21|What?!
21|We're the only ones you can rely on?
21|Oh well, we have no choice then!
21|Seeing you this scared has made me feel sorry for you,
21|so I'll go convince Karen to stay!
21|We'll let the police deal with the monster cat!
21|Thanks.
21|Scene no. 126
21|Indiscriminately attacking people with its Energy Drain...
21|I can't figure out what the Curse Cat's objective is.
21|Do I really have the right to know, though?
21|Actually, before that...
21|Do I even want to know?
21|Given how shook up I was just sneaking into her house and finding out what it was really like,
21|do I even want to know?
21|Aren't there things in the world that are better left unknown?
21|If you're going to selfishly admire someone only to be disillusioned later,
21|then maybe you shouldn't try to get to know them better at all.
21|Maybe, just maybe, I shouldn't have gotten involved in Hanekawa's business back there.
21|Maybe I should've pretended the bruise didn't exist.
21|But, y'know...
21|Wouldn't that just be cherry-picking?
21|Do I really just want to like, admire, and have high hopes for her, but nothing more?
21|After all she did for me over spring break?
21|I racked my brains, but I just couldn't figure it out.
21|If there's one thing that's for sure, though,
21|it's that I knew absolutely nothing about her.
21|And here I was rattling on about love and what not. Ridiculous.
21|Now that it's come to this,
21|I'm ashamed of that conversation I had with Tsukihi.
21|But still, even now,
21|my chest feels like it's going to explode when I think about Hanekawa.
21|1st May
21|Hanekawa didn't come to school on the first,
21|2nd May
21|or the second of May.
21|Rumors of the monster cat, including several eye-witness accounts,
21|Naoetsu High Sch
21|had spread all over the school by the end the second day,
21|which showed how active the Curse Cat was being.
21|The holidays started again the next day, but before that,
21|I decided to go visit the abandoned building Oshino lived in.
21|O-Oshino!
21|Hey, Araragi.
21|I got tired of waiting for you.
21|I was thinking it was about time for you to show up.
21|I did want to make a complete recovery before you did, though.
21|But I used up all my miracle bandages to heal you the other day...
21|What on earth happened to you, Oshino?
21|What happened, you ask?
21|Nothing, really.
21|I lost, that's all.
21|L-Lost? To what?
21|Unnumbered scene
21|To the Curse Cat, obviously.
21|It's been nearly three days since the night of April 30th.
21|In that time, I fought it around twenty times...
21|And lost around twenty times.
21|You lost every single time?
21|Yeah, every single time.
21|I was a mere shadow of my former self.
21|Good grief.
21|A high school girl in her underwear is way too tempting a sight for an old man's sore eyes.
21|I couldn't fight her properly at all because I kept getting distracted.
21|Really, why would you suck all the energy out of an exhausted and withered old man like me?
21|Are you serious? Is the Curse Cat that powerful?
21|Strong enough to overpower even a specialist like you?
21|Nah, it's not.
21|I mentioned it in passing the other day,
21|but it's a low-level Oddity that's no match for the vampire that attacked you.
21|More like, the very comparison is an insult to the latter.
21|What? Wait a minute.
21|Yeah, you did say the other day that there was a clear disparity between the Curse Cat and a vampire,
21|but you never said anything about it being a low-level Oddity.
21|I left that part of the explanation out,
21|because you probably would've offered to help.
21|That's why I didn't tell you.
21|Provided they put their brains to good use, even a rank amateur can deal with the Curse Cat.
21|That's how weak it actually is.
21|What? But...
21|Of course, that doesn't mean I took the gas off the pedal.
21|I threw everything I had at it,
21|but I lost.
21|The Curse Cat's a weakling.
21|It plays dead, pretending to be run over, and possesses anyone who approaches it out of pity.
21|It's a monster that replaces those it possesses.
21|An Oddity that usurps the body.
21|And like a god of misfortune, it drags both the body and its original owner down to the very depths of hell.
21|It's a monster that fits the usual template.
21|What makes this an unbelievably exceptional case though, is that it's Ms. Class Rep that's been possessed.
21|She's turned the Curse Cat, normally a total weakling, into an incredibly strong Oddity,
21|one that could possibly even rival a vampire.
21|Sharing a body is one thing, but the fact that they're sharing a brain makes them dangerous.
21|My traditional anti-Oddity measures,
21|techniques and methods have no effect at all on her.
21|That's because she holds specialist-level expertise in even this field.
21|She knows everything.
21|I've never even heard of an Oddity that uses tactics and strategies to attack people.
21|It's something we've known all along, but Ms. Class Rep really is extraordinary.
21|The skills she displays when attacking people aren't the kind you see out of an Oddity.
21|Hold on a second.
21|"The skills she displays when attacking people?"
21|You're making it sound like Hanekawa's attacking people of her own free will.
21|Well, that's what it boils down to.
21|The Curse Cat is not that kind of Oddity.
21|However, Araragi.
21|It might not actually be a bad thing that I'm having such a hard time dealing with her.
21|You could say this proves that Ms. Class Rep still exists inside the Curse Cat.
21|That's what I think.
21|At the very least, this wouldn't've happened if it had completely taken over both her mind and body.
21|A considerably large part of her consciousness is probably still intact,
21|which is exactly why she's that strong.
21|This is really bad news.
21|But at the same time, it also tells us that there's still hope.
21|How? What part of it does?
21|Well, I mean...
21|She'd be done for if she'd been completely taken over.
21|We'd have to kill her.
21|What I mean to say is,
21|we'd better salvage Ms. Class Rep's consciousness while it still exists and exterminate the monster cat.
21|Or else Hanekawa Tsubasa, your precious friend, will disappear completely from this world.
21|Scene no. 212
21|Once upon a time, there was a white cat lying dead on the road.
21|Finding that cat pitiable, a passerby buried it and prayed for it.
21|From that night onward, that virtuous man's behavior took a turn for the worse.
21|Admitting that he was now out of control,
21|the people around him summoned an exorcist in a bid to exorcize the cat that had possessed him.
21|Now here's the punch line.
21|This is where the Curse Cat bares its fangs.
21|It turns out that the virtuous man hadn't been possessed by a cat at all.
21|Unnumbered scene
21|A twist, or an absurd conclusion...
21|Call it what you want, but this is an Oddity Tale that comes with a lesson of sorts.
21|A human being made exclusively of virtue cannot possibly exist.
21|Kindness is nothing but the tip of the iceberg that is a human being.
21|There is always a counterpart.
21|If there be light, then there is darkness; if white, black.
21|It's an anecdote that sees right through human nature.
21|Why a cat, though?
21|That's because humans wear facat es all the time.
21|That's because humans wear facades all the time.
21|That's because humans wear facat es all the time.
21|Ms. Class Rep was likely wearing one too.
21|A human who is perfectly fair and virtuous does not exist.
21|Instead, it's because she insists on being one that her stress becomes piled up,
21|unleashing her dark side.
21|Normally a facade would only serve as a mask, but for whatever reason,
21|Ms. Class Rep has pretty much become united with the Curse Cat.
21|If we consider the cat to be the dominant party, then maybe it would be better to call it assimilation.
21|A formidable opponent indeed.
21|Or should I say, invincible.
21|It'll spell big trouble if we don't end this soon.
21|We're in real danger of reaching an outcome where it turns out she hadn't been possessed by a cat at all.
21|We have to do something before she completely merges with the cat.
21|3rd May - Constitution Day
21|Unnumbered scene
21|The well-endowed Hanekawa always pushes her breasts against this desk, doesn't she?
21|What are you, a purrvert without limits?
21|How furightening. You're scarier than an Oddity.
21|You just furvently licked a girl's desk and got all aroused.
21|No, that's not it!
21|More importantly, where did you come from? How did you get into this classroom?
21|More impurrtantly?
21|What on earth could be more impurrtant than you licking my master's desk, human?
21|I have no idea what you're talking about!
21|Say whatever you want, I'm not going to admit anything in court!
21|Meowhaha
21|Hmm? What?
21|I don't sense much hostility from your expurrsion, human.
21|Well, that's because there isn't much I could do to you anyway, Cat.
21|Besides, it's not like you're going to kill me,
21|right?
21|Who kneows?
21|My Energy Drain is an irreplaceable purrt of who I am,
21|and not a skill I can fureely use, let alone control.
21|I could go easy on someone, but the extent of which is out of my hands.
21|It's pawsible that I might kill someone without even intending to.
21|Still, I much prefer this to having you bite or claw away at me the moment we run into each other.
21|I'd be done for in an instant if you did that again.
21|Meowhaha
21|Vampire
21|A vampire, huh?
21|A top-class Oddity that I originally wouldn't even dream of locking claws with.
21|But thanks to my master's knowledge of strategy and tactics,
21|I've become an existence capable of overwhelming even an Oddity specialist.
21|I appreciate it, fur real.
21|I'm not one to return a favor.
21|I'm more the type of Oddity that'd pay one back with malice.
21|Fur this case, however, I'm so grateful to her I might make an exception.
21|Vampire
21|Unnumbered scene
21|Well, vampires and you might both possess Energy Drain as a special trait,
21|but I'm sure they don't work the same way.
21|A vampire's Energy Drain is a meal,
21|Scene no. 275
21|whereas the Curse Cat's is a curse.
21|Scene no. 275
21|Purrcisely.
21|What I don't get, though, is why you're indiscriminately attacking people.
21|If we're going to talk about different types of Oddities here, the Curse Cat isn't one that would do that, right?
21|Hey, Cat. You...
21|Oh, it's not impurrtant.
21|Just fur a distraction, that's all.
21|Huh?
21|I'm only attacking people fur a distraction.
21|This is basically the same thing
21|as ringing the doorbell and running away,
21|or clawing graffiti on the walls.
21|A stress buster!
21|A stress buster?
21|Wait, huh?
21|What does that mean?
21|"What does it mean?"
21|It means exactly what it says on the can.
21|You did notice the appurrance of that house on the inside, right?
21|That house?
21|Where my master lives.
21|I know you did.
21|Cats have a pretty good sense of smell, too.
21|I go back fur a change of clothes, and what do I find?
21|Your scent was all over the place.
21|Unnumbered scene
21|Fur fifteen years, my master has been in that home—that household.
21|You can just imagine how much purressure that was putting her under, can't you?
21|Playing purranks on the good people of this town purrovides her some relief.
21|That's all there is to it.
21|These purranks have nothing to do with curses.
21|How so?
21|Are Oddities even capable of such behavior?
21|Being a purrssessive type of Oddity, I've usurped my master's body.
21|Now, you might also say I've usurped her mind as well,
21|so I know what kind of life my master has led fur the past fifteen years in that house.
21|That's why I'm lending her a helping paw with her stress busting.
21|But if those are your reasons,
21|you don't need to attack people unrelated to this, do you?
21|Unfurtunately, this is the only way I know how to do things.
21|Evil deeds are fun.
21|It's fun because it causes trouble fur complete strangers.
21|There's no logic to it, but it's not inconsistent either.
21|At the very least, don't you think I'm a little more mellow
21|meow that I have a more stable personality?
21|Compurred to when I tore your arm off, I mean.
21|I did notice that, yeah.
21|It means what I'm doing is having a pawsitive effect.
21|That's how it is, so rest assured.
21|This stress busting will end if I attack another five hundred people or so.
21|And at that time, I, as an oddity, will disappurr,
21|having carried out my duties and repaid my debt.
21|So tell that old man with the Hawaiian shirt not to interfere.
21|I don't really get it, but he wants to help my master out, doesn't he?
21|So tell him to leave her to me.
21|Why would you go that far?
21|Aren't you just an evil spirit that's possessed Hanekawa?
21|You shouldn't have any reason to go out of your way to help her.
21|I've been telling you fur a while that this is all so I can repay my debt to her, even if it's out of character.
21|It was all a tall tail, though.
21|To be purrfectly honest, apart from her sharing her knowledge with me,
21|I don't really have a reason to feel indebted to my master.
21|What're you talking about?
21|Didn't Hanekawa bury you when you were lying dead after getting run over?
21|Isn't that how you imposed yourself on her? By taking advantage of her kindness and compassion?
21|Meow that's not true.
21|On the surface, the event itself happened fur sure.
21|My master picked me up when I was lying dead on the road,
21|moved me to a location with a nice view, and purried me there.
21|You aren't mistaken in your knowledge of the event itself.
21|Scene no. 333
21|However, my master held no sympurrthy for me at all at the time.
21|She held a funeral fur me thinking it was the most obvious thing in the world to do,
21|in a completely unemotional manner.
21|It was like she had no pity fur me at all.
21|So in truth, nothing was there fur me to take advantage of.
21|But wait, Hanekawa was—
21|My master's only desire is to be a normal girl.
21|"If you find a dead cat by the road, bury it."
21|Well, that's the purrfectly right thing to do.
21|You could even call it a law, or a furmula.
21|So she obeyed that law. Followed that furmula.
21|That's all there was to it.
21|Normally, there's no way one can abide by those rules.
21|Most people wouldn't think about burying a dead cat,
21|even if they knew it was the right, lovely thing to do.
21|Scene no. 344
21|No, they might think about it,
21|but they wouldn't actually do it.
21|They'd find it impossible to, on both a physical and emotional level.
21|However, Hanekawa will pull it off.
21|Hanekawa can
21|Scene no. 345
21|never ever become
21|Scene no. 345
21|a normal girl
21|Scene no. 345
21|That's right. She'll pull it off.
21|Her emotions won't come into play at all.
21|She won't feel a thing.
21|She can carry out her morals like a machine.
21|I've been given several funerals, but none on purr with hers.
21|Almost too black
21|Scene no. 345
21|That's why I felt inclined to save her.
21|A Stygian blackness
21|Scene no. 346
21|Classroom
21|Scene no. 346
21|In short, it's just a whim of mine.
21|Cat-like, right?
21|So make sure to pass on my message.
21|Tell that Hawaiian bastard to overlook my pranks if he doesn't want to be sued for animal cruelty.
21|It's the least he could do fur me, considering I've let him do as he pleased all this time.
21|What's that supposed to mean?
21|Scene no. 352
21|You already know, don't you?
21|Scene no. 353
21|I would've killed him in the very first round if I,
21|Scene no. 353
21|had any
21|Scene no. 354
21|or rather my master,
21|real intention
21|Scene no. 354
21|had any real intention to harm him.
21|I've been holding back in all of our catfights because he's an acquaintance of hers.
21|As for you...
21|Well, it doesn't look like you're planning on doing anything.
21|Yeah, that's the right answer.
21|The right thing to do fur you, if you want to help my master out, is to do nothing.
21|You don't purrrticularly want to die, do you?
21|See ya, human.
21|You... should try your best to lead a happy nine lives.
21|Wait!
21|Hmm?
21|If relieving Hanekawa of her stress is your objective, I'll tell you right now that it's impossible.
21|Huh? Why?
21|Hanekawa's parents are the ones causing her all that stress, right?
21|Even if you released all of it for her, it'd only start accumulating again once she went back home.
21|You could attack five hundred strangers,
21|or keep stress busting for a month,
21|but somewhere down the line it'll all reset.
21|Hmm?
21|Yeah, that's right.
21|In that case, I'll just have to keep beating them up fur her until they stop coming back.
21|I won't let it end with just the Energy Drain meow.
21|I'll simply respond to domewstic violence with some of my own,
21|if that's what my master purrefers.
21|As if—
21|Yup. That's the right choice.
21|You'll be cursed the moment you caress me.
21|That's why I'm the Curse Cat.
21|Stay away from me.
21|Don't put even a single finger on me.
21|The right choice here is to not get involved with me
21|and, probably,
21|not with my master either.
21|Cat, you...
21|I'll catch you later.
21|Lead a happy life.
21|This is hopeless.
21|I really do...
21|like Hanekawa.
21|I like her so much I can't bring myself to touch her.
21|I like her.
21|I wondered if I liked her, felt I did, and realized I did.
21|But in a way, Tsukihi was right.
21|I really do like her, unbearably so,
21|but these feelings of mine aren't what you'd call love.
21|Unnumbered scene
21|They'd gone past love a long time ago.

21|Forget wanting to always be with her...
21|Right now I want to die for Hanekawa.

22|3rd May
22|4th May
22|As for how I spent the rest of my Golden Week...
22|5th May
22|6th May
22|7th May
22|Well,
22|I spent it constantly kowtowing.
22|Unnumbered scene
22|The Demon Sword, "Heart Bequeath,"
22|also known as the "Oddity Slayer."
22|So you got your hands on Heart Bequeath?
22|That's great.
22|I'm extremely surprised that Ms. Vampire changed her mind.
22|Let me congratulate you.
22|Ms. Class Rep's parents...
22|They've already been discharged from the hospital.
22|Really?
22|So I went and spoke to them for a bit.
22|I didn't get any information that'd prove useful in a fight against the Curse Cat,
22|but instead I did manage to hear one rather interesting anecdote.
22|An interesting anecdote?
22|About the time Ms. Class Rep's father hit her in the face.
22|He snapped and hit her really hard.
22|The blow apparently sent Ms. Class Rep flying all the way to the wall.
22|Well, she is pretty lightweight.
22|After she slammed into the wall and spent a little while squirming in pain,
22|what do you think Ms. Class Rep did next, Araragi?
22|"You shouldn't hit a girl in the face, Dad."
22|That's what she said, apparently. With a smile on her face.
22|That's what she said after her father hit her?!
22|That?!
22|Creepy, isn't it?
22|She's so righteous it's scary.
22|Unnumbered scene
22|She's terrifying. Even more terrifying than an Oddity.
22|Revolting.
22|What, are you taking their side on this, Oshino?
22|I'm not going to take sides. I'm neutral.
22|I'm talking about standpoints here, that's all.
22|Ms. Class Rep has her point of view,
22|and her parents have their own.
22|There's no way for an outsider to know which of them is right.
22|Actually, there isn't a right one in the first place.
22|It's just about who's easier to agree with.
22|Still, Hanekawa's...
22|Hanekawa's in the right.
22|That's exactly what makes it so creepy and terrifying, right?
22|Of course, Ms. Class Rep's parents aren't exactly admirable people.
22|But you know, Araragi,
22|I can't help but understand how they feel.
22|Just imagine living under the same roof with a person that righteous,
22|let alone your own daughter. It sends shivers down my spine.
22|They had to live with someone so unbearably righteous for more than a dozen whole years.
22|In other words,
22|they were trapped in a hell where they had their ugliness
22|and their immaturity shoved into their faces every single day. An absolute nightmare.
22|If anything, I almost admire that they lasted all those years without hitting her.
22|But no matter how you look at it,
22|there's no way that was Hanekawa's fault.
22|Oh, but it was.
22|Those with power must, at all times,
22|be aware of the effect their power has on those around them.
22|Curse
22|Scene no. 127
22|Everything about this current situation is irregular.
22|Anything and everything about it is irregular,
22|but Ms. Class Rep's the only irregularity.
22|Each and every single little thing...
22|is Ms. Class Rep's fault.
22|I'm sorry, Oshino,
22|but could you stop badmouthing Hanekawa?
22|Unnumbered scene
22|It makes me want to kill you.
22|Do you feel that way out of pity for Ms. Class Rep?
22|Hell no!
22|You're completely wrong.
22|It's not like you to be so ridiculously far off the mark, Oshino.
22|As if I'd ever feel any pity.
22|In fact, unlucky women only turn me on!
22|All I want is to relieve some of my sexual frustration.
22|It's just that this high school girl with cat ears, wearing only her underwear,
22|is driving me crazy with lust.
22|Scene no. 155
22|The Demon Sword, "Heart Bequeath,"
22|is a lethal weapon that exists solely to slay Oddities.
22|Using this Oddity Slayer will let me exterminate only the Curse Cat
22|without injuring Hanekawa in any way whatsoever.
22|I don't have anything else to say as a specialist,
22|but as your friend—
22|as your best friend—I want to warn you about a few things.
22|Warn me? About what?
22|Firstly.
22|That sword makes it possible to separate Ms. Class Rep from the Curse Cat.
22|That does indeed seem to be the best idea for dealing with the Curse Cat once and for all.
22|However, it's precisely because it seems like the best idea
22|that it will likely be the one thing Ms. Class Rep is most on her guard against.
22|I mean, it's an idea that even you were able to think of,
22|Scene no. 162
22|so don't you think it would've been the first she anticipated and took measures against?
22|Scene no. 163
22|If we're talking hypothetically, yes.
22|However, I'm pretty confident that things will go smoothly.
22|I have a plan of my own.
22|A plan?
22|Well, maybe not a plan.
22|It's more of a hope.
22|Scene no. 166
22|Hmm?
22|Okay. I'll just trust you on that one, then.
22|If you're really okay with that, that is.
22|I am. Don't make it sound like there's more to it.
22|What were the two other things you wanted to warn me about?
22|Actually, scratch the second one.
22|There's no point in even mentioning it.
22|Let me just go straight to the third.
22|At the time, I had a pretty good idea what Oshino's second warning would've been.
22|Here we go with the third and final warning.
22|A very important and practical question that needs to be asked, Araragi.
22|How are you even going to find Ms. Class Rep?
22|She could be hiding anywhere in town.
22|Scene no. 174
22|Rest assured,
22|I have a proper plan for that.
22|One that's more than hopes or wishful thinking,
22|so you don't need to bother.
22|Anyway, let's each do our own thing from here on out.
22|As a specialist, you go look for the Curse Cat using your methods,
22|and I'll go look for it using mine.
22|Your methods, eh, Araragi?
22|Yeah. Something you can't do.
22|My ultimate technique.
22|Oh?
22|Show me what you've got, then.
22|Do as you please.
22|I don't care if you end up causing a bloodbath or a tragedy.
22|Unnumbered scene
22|No matter what happens, I won't interfere.
22|White
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Are you all right, Araragi?
22|Oh, I see.
22|You tricked me.
22|Yeah, I did.
22|Scene no. 199
22|Didn't take you long, Curse Cat.
22|Showing up in just thirty minutes?
22|You amaze me.
22|You're the worst, Araragi.
22|Lying to people and making them worry
22|is not a very nice thing to do.
22|Hah!
22|What?
22|What's so funny? I'm really mad, you know.
22|Well, you see...
22|it's just that you've dropped that speech quirk of yours,
22|Hanekawa.
22|What's wrong, Ms. Honor Student?
22|Isn't the Curse Cat supposed to make cat puns all the time?
22|White
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Wow.
22|No, maybe I should say "meow" instead.
22|Either way—
22|Huh, what? When did you figure it out?
22|I just knew somehow. Right from the start.
22|I'm your friend, you know.
22|There's no way I'd mistake you for someone else.
22|And there's absolutely no way I wouldn't know it was you.
22|Regardless of whether you get possessed by an Oddity, or take one in,
22|you'll always be the same, Hanekawa.
22|Your personality might change, but your character won't.
22|That's what you're like.
22|That's what makes you you.
22|If you got a text from a friend in trouble,
22|you'd rush to help them without a second thought,
22|regardless of the circumstances or the situation.
22|Like a cat instinctively spitting out furballs,
22|you'd rush to their aid without thinking.
22|That's who you are.
22|This?
22|This is who I am?
22|It is.
22|I mean, on one hand you're mad at me right now for lying to you,
22|but you're also feeling relieved, right?
22|You heaved a huge sigh of relief, didn't you?
22|You're incredibly kind and unbelievably strong.
22|Too kind and strong for your own good.
22|Kind enough to grow tired of life,
22|and strong enough to sell your soul to an Oddity.
22|You're righteous enough to overwhelm people.
22|I understand why you'd want to deny that you are.
22|I don't understand, but at the same time, I do understand.
22|But you see, Hanekawa...
22|But you know, Hanekawa...
22|But Hanekawa...
22|That is who you are!
22|You're going to be that person for the rest of your life!
22|You are not going to change!
22|That's what you were born as, and that's what you've grown into, so just give it up!
22|You're going to have to just suck it up and live with yourself!
22|Listen to yourself, Araragi.
22|Don't be so unreasonable.
22|It's hard on me too, you know.
22|Even I have things I can and cannot do.
22|I'm just a human too.
22|Scene no. 238
22|But you aren't.
22|You gave yourself up to an Oddity.
22|As you are now, you don't deserve to call yourself a human.
22|You say some cruel things, Araragi,
22|despite knowing why I ended up like this.
22|And yet you tell me to just "suck it up"?
22|That's cruel. Heartless, even.
22|Aren't you going to show me any pity at all?
22|No.
22|You never found out who your biological father was, your mother committed suicide,
22|you got passed from family to family all over the place,
22|you failed to create any bonds with your step-parents and thus grew up in a cold household,
22|you still tried to force yourself to be a normal girl and—of all things—that's what you succeeded at.
22|Lady luck just isn't on your side at all, I swear.
22|You're really unfortunate, almost way too much so.
22|What's wrong with that, though?
22|You may be unfortunate, but that doesn't mean you have to suffer.
22|You may not be blessed, but that doesn't mean you have to throw a fit over it.
22|Even if bad things happen to you, just be strong!
22|You're going to go home after this acting like nothing had ever happened and,
22|now that your parents are back, you're going to live the exact same life you've been leading up until now.
22|You're never, ever going to reconcile with them.
22|I guarantee it!
22|It's useless, even if you should miraculously chance upon happiness in the future.
22|You could end up on cloud nine for all I care, but that's not going to change the fact that you've had an unhappy past!
22|You'll remember that just as you're about to forget it.
22|We're going to keep having nightmares for the rest of our lives!
22|Reality won't change a single bit!
22|It won't change...
22|I'm definitely not going to pity you.
22|Don't use some cat as a pretext.
22|Don't make an Oddity your excuse.
22|Don't use misfortune as a springboard to growth.
22|At the end of the day, you're basically just hurting yourself.
22|Scene no. 268
22|Oddities don't actually exist, you know?
22|Scene no. 268
22|They're fabrications!
22|Scene no. 268
22|If you still want to relieve some of that stress, I'll take care of that for you.
22|I'll fondle the heck out of your breasts whenever you want,
22|and I'll stare a hole through whichever part of your underwear-clad body you want me to.
22|Could you settle for that?
22|I'll make as much time for you as you need.
22|Because I'm your friend.
22|You really are the worst, Araragi.
22|It makes my head hurt.
22|You're someone who can play a starring role but not a hero, right?
22|No, I can do neither.
22|The only role I can play is that of a vampire.
22|Scene no. 276
22|So you won't do it.
22|Araragi
22|Scene no. 278
22|Araragi
22|Scene no. 278
22|You won't play hero for me. You won't do it.
22|Araragi
22|Scene no. 278
22|I've been thinking about this for a while, but you actually hate me, don't you?
22|Yeah.
22|I hate your guts, Hanekawa.
22|I see.
22|And I actually hate yours too, Araragi.
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Die.
22|Go die.
22|Just go die.
22|I should just go die!
22|You'll take care of all my stress fur me?
22|How purrfectly delightful.
22|Can I kill you, then?
22|Sure, go ahead.
22|It's what I want.
22|I want to die by your hand.
22|White
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Really?
22|Then die.
22|It hur—
22|It hurts!
22|White
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Araragi!
22|What...
22|What did you do to me?!
22|You prepared... a sword?
22|That's right.
22|I swallowed it in advance,
22|like one of those old stage magicians.
22|But...
22|But Araragi!
22|This pain is...
22|It doesn't hurt, right?
22|It doesn't hurt you.
22|That sword's called the Oddity Slayer.
22|It's a demonic sword, one I borrowed from a vampire, that slays only Oddities.
22|It cut not you, but the Curse Cat inside you.
22|Scene no. 342
22|How can such a nonsensical sword even exist?
22|You didn't know about it, did you?
22|Even Oshino, a specialist, only found out a short while ago that she possessed such an insane sword.
22|It literally transcends human understanding.
22|A sword even Oshino didn't know about...
22|You definitely wouldn't have fallen for this if you knew such a killer item existed, right?
22|Having said that,
22|this really could've ended up as wishful thinking on my part.
22|Because there was a chance you could still have known about this sword's existence.
22|I'm relieved, Hanekawa.
22|Looks like you don't know everything either.
22|Then don't act like you do and give up on life!
22|Don't go spouting crap like how you should just go die!
22|You still have a ton of things you don't know about!
22|So say it like you always do:
22|"I don't know everything. I only know what I know."
22|I'm going to die.
22|I'm going to die by Hanekawa's hand.
22|I'm going to die for Hanekawa.
22|Oh man,
22|this makes me so happy.
22|I'm fully aware that this was an extremely foolish thing to do.
22|It serves no purpose.
22|The Oddity Slayer can exterminate the Curse Cat, sure,
22|but it's not going to help Hanekawa overcome her stress,
22|nor will it make the friction in her family disappear.
22|Oshino probably would've settled it in the very first round if he wanted things to end this way.
22|I'm pretty sure that's the second thing Oshino wanted to warn me about earlier.
22|It's okay, though.
22|I didn't particularly want to save you anyway, Hanekawa.
22|Pointless and futile as it may be,
22|I want to die for you.
22|That's all there is to it.
22|White
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Did splitting Hanekawa from the Curse Cat using the demon sword cause an adverse reaction?
22|What the hell are you doing, Cat?
22|What's hurting Hanekawa going to achieve?
22|Didn't you go out of your way to help Hanekawa
22|because she didn't pity you at all when she found you run over and dead?
22|Scene no. 384
22|That's how it was for me too!
22|Scene no. 386
22|Back when I'd been attacked by a vampire and was no longer human,
22|Scene no. 386
22|Hanekawa didn't once pity or look down on me.
22|Scene no. 388
22|Scene no. 390
22|She saw me as an equal!
22|White
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Isn't that right, Curse Cat?
22|Even when lying dead on the street, or being hunted by vampires,
22|we're in no way pitiful, right?!
22|That's why you fell in love with Hanekawa too, right?!
22|So stop...
22|Stop hurting her like that!
22|Stop.
22|Please stop.
22|I beg of you, please stop!
22|Unnumbered scene
22|What are you, stupid?
22|Everyone knows that forcibly pulling the plug tends to damage the hardware, servant of mine.
22|Scene no. 398
22|You sure did use my sword, my pride and joy, in an absurd manner.
22|What a preposterous way to chop up an Oddity.
22|It almost makes me laugh.
22|Scene no. 401
22|Good heavens, servant of mine. You're only focusing on what's in front of you, like always.
22|You selfishly kept me alive, so don't you dare believe for one second that you can go off and die,
22|you oaf.
22|I'll show you how it's done, so just sit there and observe.
22|Scene no. 413
22|Obsesserve.
22|Are you ready?
22|This is how you slay an Oddity.
22|This is all right, isn't it?
22|It's all right this way, isn't it, Hanekawa?
22|We're a bunch of good-for-nothings.
22|Unbelievably unfortunate,
22|unreasonably unrewarded,
22|and completely incapable of righting the wrongs we make.
22|And that's how we'll stay for the rest of our lives,
22|but we're all right this way, aren't we?
22|No way. Absolutely not.
22|Scene no. 429
22|8th May
22|The next day,
22|I wolfed down my breakfast and left home on my bike.
22|I had to make a layover on my way to school.
22|28 60 min.
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Now, then.
22|How am I supposed to pet her now?
22|Oh, that?
22|Ms. Vampire demanded I buy it for her.
22|And, well, I gave it to her as a reward since she was the one who resolved that whole cat business in the end.
22|Quite the letdown.
22|It was a really short-lived dream.
22|By the way, Oshino.
22|Hanekawa...
22|She's fine, right?
22|Yeah, she's perfectly fine.
22|I can guarantee it.
22|Ms. Class Rep has no recollection at all of the things that happened this Golden Week.
22|Her memories as Black Hanekawa...
22|have been lost completely.
22|"Black Hanekawa?"
22|What's that supposed to be?
22|That's what Ms. Class Rep had become.
22|Scene no. 450
22|You can't exactly refer to it as the Curse Cat.
22|Scene no. 450
22|New variations need new names.
22|Scene no. 450
22|The latest monster of the modern era,
22|Scene no. 451
22|Black Hanekawa.
22|You suck so bad at naming things.
22|Scene no. 453
22|Apparently, Ms. Class Rep temporarily regained consciousness once she Energy Drained her parents.
22|Basically, her wish was granted at that point in time.
22|That's what it means, I guess.
22|Her wish...
22|Unnumbered scene
22|She changed back almost immediately afterward, though.
22|No.
22|Ms. Class Rep wished for it so strongly that she dragged the cat,
22|which was already leaving her at that point, back in and absorbed it even deeper.
22|That was the moment a new Oddity—Black Hanekawa—was born.
22|Scene no. 463
22|Scene no. 465
22|Scene no. 467
22|While we're on the subject of new types of monsters,
22|Hanekawa was always possessed by one, wasn't she?
22|A monster called family.
22|Family, eh?
22|But Ms. Class Rep doesn't consider her current parents to be family, does she?
22|That's exactly it.
22|Maybe the very concept of family is an Oddity in Hanekawa's eyes.
22|Maybe.
22|Though, when I think about it, the fact that Hanekawa stayed the same even after she turned into a cat
22|really makes me wonder.
22|White
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Why don't you just marry her?
22|What?
22|Like I said, why don't you just marry Ms. Class Rep?
22|That way, she'd get her hands on a real family at long last.
22|You know...
22|That's a terrible joke, Oshino.
22|Really?
22|I think it's a great idea.
22|It's a small price to pay for Ms. Class Rep extending a helping hand to you over spring break.
22|You seem to be forgetting that Hanekawa has feelings of her own.
22|Of course she does.
22|It's because she has feelings that she can be bewitched.
22|She can become a victim, and a culprit.
22|She can even become an Oddity.
22|But you have your own feelings, don't you?
22|My own feelings...
22|I was convinced you were in love with Ms. Class Rep, you know.
22|Unnumbered scene
22|Don't be stupid.
22|I'm not in love with Hanekawa.
22|Is that so?
22|Yeah.
22|Let's leave it at that.
22|Unnumbered scene
22|That'd be for the best.
22|If you're fine with that, then sure.
22|I did ask how you felt, but Ms. Class Rep's feelings are much more important than yours.
22|No matter what the Curse Cat does,
22|no matter what you do,
22|when it comes down to it, she has to save herself.
22|Besides, Hanekawa's not even looking for help in the first place.
22|I wish she'd looked to me for help.
22|I would've done whatever it took, if she had only relied on me.
22|Maybe she did.
22|Huh?
22|It's not like people only look for help by saying "please help me."
22|In a similar vein, it's not like you're only in love with someone if you say "I love you."
22|Everyone has things they can't say on impulse.
22|Isn't that right, Araragi?
22|I'm not at all worried.
22|I'm confident that I can respond to Hanekawa's usual smile with one of my own.
22|After all, it's not like I'm in love with her or anything.
22|I will never in my life say that I am.
22|Hanekawa.
22|Hanekawa...
22|N a o e t s u
22|H i g h S c h o o l
22|Someday, I'll fall in love with someone other than you.
22|I will, for the first time in my life, fall in love with someone other than you.
22|You showed me how to sympathize with others,
22|so there'll surely come a day when I fall in love with one of those people.
22|However, I will always look back on those nine days that you forgot,
22|those nine days that glittered like gold, with nostalgia.
22|I don't think I'll ever be able to forget them.
22|No matter what the future holds for me,
22|no matter what path I walk from now on,
22|these feelings I developed for you can never be denied.
22|They will forever stay the same.
22|That's how, during the Golden Week
22|of my third year of high school—
22|the May I spent as an eighteen year old—
22|I, Araragi Koyomi, saw something that wasn't my first love
22|come to a disappointing end.
22|And thus, I climb these stairs.
22|Cat Story
22|Cat
22|Tsubasa Family
22|And in spite of that we
22|laugh knowingly as though we
22|planned it beforehand
22|Sigh if you want to
22|and take a deep breath then
22|Don't worry if it looks foolish
22|I will keep waiting
22|for what you wish for
22|Would it be a lie to say
22|that there is still time?
22|I don't want to be saved
22|I don't want to be rewarded
22|I just want to enjoy these fragile days
22|Every day I make my wishes
22|My experiences remain bittersweet
22|Far atop the horizon I felt
22|my fading daydream
22|On to the next story...
22|I'm a cat.
22|I will cry, but I won't shed tears.
22|White
22|CAT STORY
22|Araragi!
22|TWISTORY
22|I looked everywhere for you, Araragi!
22|I might be the Devil.
22|FLOWER STORY
22|I hate you, Koyomi!
22|BAIT STORY
22|Liar. Even though you're God.
22|Vampire Punch!
22|DEMON STORY
22|There's someone I want you to deceive.
22|LOVE STORY
23|I apologize for this jarring and unexpected development,
23|but it appears I have been kidnapped.
23|This happened ten days into summer vacation, on July 29th.
23|No, it's possible that it's already the 30th.
23|Oh, you're awake, Araragi-kun.
23|I'm glad.
23|I was worried you might have died.
23|Are you all right?
23|Does the back of your head hurt?
23|Senjougahara,
23|remove these handcuffs.
23|No.
23|I knew it! You did this!
23|I see...
23|Interesting theory,
23|assuming you have proof.
23|I guessed the minute I saw you chose to confine me at this cram school.
23|Now take off the handcuffs!
23|No.
23|Also, I can't. I've thrown away the key.
23|Seriously?
23|I also threw away the antidote.
23|You poisoned me, too?!
23|That was a lie.
23|Though it might come true if you don't do as I say.
23|Float like a butterfly, sting like a butterfly!
23|Butterflies don't sting!
23|I said it wrong.
23|Good for you, to be able to point out my mistake.
23|Take pride in this moment forever.
23|What's this new, avant-garde method of admitting your mistakes?
23|The correct word was "bee."
23|Bee poison is strong, isn't it?
23|Don't worry.
23|Araragi-kun,
23|I'll protect you.
23|You won't die.
23|Because I'll protect you.
23|I'd prefer to enjoy this conversation
23|with no unnecessary Evangelion references.
23|And, um, Gahara-san?
23|I'm hungry...
23|And kinda thirsty.
23|Want to get something to eat?
23|I expected a wormlike fool like yourself might say that,
23|so I brought several items with me.
23|Did you?
23|Then give me something to drink.
23|You want something to drink?
23|Well, I guess...
23|But I'm going to drink it.
23|It's good.
23|What's with that look of longing?
23|No one said they were giving it to you.
23|Or did you think I'd feed it to you, mouth-to-mouth?
23|My, Araragi-kun...
23|You're so naughty.
23|In this situation, only Kanbaru would come up with that!
23|Yeah?
23|But what about when I made out with you?
23|Don't bring that up, in this setting!
23|All right, then.
23|If you absolutely must drink it, I'll let you.
23|I absolutely must drink it.
23|Has this man no pride?
23|To say something so humiliating, from a simple desire for water.
23|Wouldn't it be better for you, if you died?
23|She really seems to be enjoying this.
23|Very well.
23|Since you're so insistent,
23|so pathetic, that I can't bear to look at you,
23|I'll give you some water, out of sympathy.
23|Be grateful,
23|water-drinking bird.
23|"Water-drinking bird" isn't really an insult, is it?
23|Lick it.
23|What's wrong?
23|You're thirsty, aren't you?
23|So stretch out your tongue,
23|and naughtily lick it, like a giraffe.
23|Hey, Senjougahara.
23|What?
23|Aren't you thirsty?
23|Or was that a lie?
23|Liars should be punished.
23|I'll lick it!
23|I'll totally lick it!
23|Please let me lick it!
23|How pathetic.
23|The ultimate in pathetic.
23|No normal person would do this, just for some water.
23|I'm sure you're
23|a pervert who just enjoys licking girls' fingers, right?
23|Senjougahara-san was enjoying herself so much, I thought she'd explode.
23|It's such a wonderful picture, I want to set it as my cell phone wallpaper.
23|Yeah? Glad to hear it.
23|Then, next I'd like a rice ball.
23|All right.
23|I'm in one of my rare generous moods.
23|What do you want in it?
23|It doesn't matter.
23|An apathetic reply.
23|Do you prefer bread?
23|That's not really it.
23|And as near as I can tell, you haven't bought any bread.
23|That's true.
23|I only brought rice balls.
23|I won't request something you don't have.
23|If you have no bread to eat, then you can eat cake.
23|Too tyrannical...
23|I was raised amidst butterflies and bees.
23|That should be "and flowers"!
23|The right answer
23|Time Passes
23|I hadn't much time today, so I got lunch from a convenience store.
23|But don't worry, Araragi-kun.
23|Starting tomorrow, I'll make your lunch myself.
23|What is this?
23|Her motives remain unclear.
23|Oh, right.
23|Her motives are totally clear.
23|Don't worry.
23|Araragi-kun,
23|I'll protect you.
23|To protect me, right?
23|She's serious.
23|Probably.
23|By the way, Senjougahara.
23|How am I supposed to use the bathroom here?
23|Don't worry.
23|I'll change your diaper.
23|Didn't you know?
23|I love you, Araragi-kun.
23|So much that I could embrace you without hesitation,
23|even if you were entirely covered in feces.
23|Including your brain, I will manage your entire body,
23|from ingestion to excretion.
23|Her love is too extreme!
23|Episode 1: Karen Bee, Part 1
23|7/29 Saturday Morning
23|Over summer break, I'm being tutored each day,
23|7/29 Saturday
23|except for Sundays, by Senjougahara.
23|And also by Hanekawa,
23|who has some of the school's best grades.
23|But on that Saturday, July 29th,
23|Hanekawa, with whom I was to study...
23|Flashback
23|"Something that I absolutely can't avoid came up.
23|I'll make it up to you
23|in exactly two days!"
23|Black Scene
23|And so, I'm bored.
23|Oh, Onii-chan...
23|Don't you have your tutoring today?
23|Yeah.
23|Hey, where is she?
23|She?
23|My bigger little sister.
23|Karen-chan's out.
23|Don't get into any trouble, you two.
23|I resent that. We aren't planning anything.
23|You're always this way.
23|You always treat us like children.
23|You worry too much.
23|I'm not worried.
23|I just don't trust you.
23|Aren't those the same thing?
23|No.
23|Worry and trust are two entirely different things.
23|They're both just words...
23|Don't stop talking halfway through!
23|So, where'd the bigger little sister go?
23|I told you, she isn't in any trouble.
23|In fact, she went to go help people out of trouble.
23|That's trouble.
23|Onii-chan, don't interfere in middle school kids' fights.
23|It's lame.
23|In their own way,
23|fights are also a valid form of communication.
23|Well, it sounds right when you put it like that.
23|It isn't that fights per se are wrong.
23|It's that people simply don't know the proper way to fight.
23|Fights
23|But the fights you two get involved with
23|are always violent.
23|I refuse to believe that's the right way to fight.
23|Just shut up!
23|I don't know!
23|I don't know anything!
23|I don't know what's going on with the bigger sister, the littler sister,
23|or the middle sister!
23|I don't have a middle sister...
23|This is why worrying about you isn't ever worth it.
23|Jeez...
23|I won't tell you to grow up,
23|but at least keep quiet.
23|I don't want to hear that from you.
23|Well, I suppose that of the two,
23|the latter is more difficult.
23|Anyone can grow up, just by aging.
23|But still, I wouldn't want them as quiet as Sengoku.
23|Oh, right. Sengoku...
23|Flashback
23|Come over to my house next time.
23|Sure.
23|Black Scene
23|Come to think of it,
23|it's been quite a while since that.
23|This is a good chance...
23|H-Hello?!
23|This is Sengoku!
23|Koyomi-oniichan, it's been a while.
23|What's up?
23|Sorry it's so abrupt,
23|but remember when I said I'd come over?
23|I was wondering if today might be good.
23|If it isn't a good day...
23|No...
23|Today, today, today!
23|Actually, I'm busy every day but today.
23|I see.
23|If you're busy every day but today,
23|today is our only option.
23|How about now?
23|Sure!
23|Actually, no time but now will work.
23|Then I'll come over now.
23|Hey! So...
23|Bye!
23|I'll watch the house.
23|No, you're coming, as well.
23|We're going to Sengoku's, so of course you're coming.
23|I thought for sure you'd go alone.
23|And I'm certain that's what Sen-chan is thinking...
23|Really?
23|No way.
23|Go by yourself.
23|I'm sure she'd prefer that.
23|Anyway
23|Anyway...
23|I won't interfere with a friend's feeling of love.
23|Even if it's unrequited.
23|Love?
23|Come?
23|She never said she'd love for me to come over.
23|She just asked me to.
23|Unlike you two, she's polite.
23|By the way, Onii-chan...
23|Do you believe that boys and girls can be friends?
23|Sure.
23|I'm Sengoku's friend!
23|I see.
23|Then I guess that works.
23|Anyway, get going.
23|Fine.
23|Then I'll go on my own.
23|Watch the house while I'm gone.
23|See you...
23|One last thing, before you go.
23|You've totally
23|stopped brawling with Karen-chan.
23|How come?
23|Lately, she's gotten too good at karate.
23|Like, way too good.
23|I'd lose in a straight-up fight.
23|Even though she's taller,
23|I should still be stronger.
23|But I guess I can't defeat a martial arts practitioner.
23|Even if that explains things with Karen-chan,
23|when I freaked out a minute ago, you backed off.
23|Dealing with you has gotten a lot easier.
23|Well, I guess so.
23|I mean, from our perspective,
23|it's good, because it's easier to get our way.
23|But you know,
23|really...
23|Don't just grow up and leave us behind.
23|It'd be boring that way...
23|Actually, you guys never knew this,
23|but I turned into a vampire.
23|Well, I turned back.
23|But it changed me. So it's possible...
23|And I mean possible, not certain,
23|that if I got into a real fight with you,
23|I could end up killing you both.
23|So I'm trying to avoid that.
23|How am I supposed to tell them that?
23|Hey, it's Hachikuji.
23|Black Scene
23|Hachikuji 5-3
23|But I promised to go to Sengoku's...
23|And I don't really like that elementary school brat, anyway.
23|Honest, I don't like her.
23|I hate her.
23|We're not even close enough that I'd talk to her if I saw her.
23|But yeah, I guess as a high schooler,
23|it's kind of sad for me to act that way toward an elementary school girl.
23|Honestly, I'm not happy to see her at all.
23|But I suppose a bare minimum of courtesy
23|demands that I maintain appearances.
23|I'm such a sap.
23|Hachikuji!
23|I've missed you...
23|I haven't seen you,
23|so I thought you'd moved away!
23|And I was so worried...
23|So let me touch you more.
23|Let me hug you more...
23|Let me lick you more!
23|Come on, stay put!
23|It makes removing your panties harder!
23|What are you doing?
23|W-Wait, Hachikuji!
23|Look, it's me!
23|It's Araragi...
23|Yomiko-san!
23|That's depressingly close.
23|But, Hachikuji,
23|I'd prefer you not call me the name of a paper-using secret agent
23|for the British Library who lives in a book-filled Jinbouchou building.
23|My name is Araragi Koyomi.
23|Excepting Light Vehicles
23|But that aside, Araragi-san,
23|where are you going today?
23|Nowhere special...
23|Excepting Boys
23|Searching for new Araragi harem members?
23|I never founded any such creepy group!
23|An original member,
23|Oshino-san, has graduated now...
23|It'll be a difficult gap to fill.
23|Even assuming this so-called Araragi harem's existence,
23|why would Oshino be a member?
23|No Old Men Allowed
23|He's an old guy in a floral shirt!
23|Add too many members,
23|and the story will be hard to follow.
23|Watch for Bears
23|So be careful.
23|Well, I told you about Sengoku right?
23|A girl I used to know...
23|I'm going over to her place today.
23|Given that, you seemed rather unhappy.
23|Did I?
23|I looked that unhappy?
23|Yeah!
23|Like a story that's gotten a lot of mileage from jokes about how
23|it'll never be animated, due to some screw-up.
23|You had an awkwardness that was reminiscent of that.
23|My face was hardly that specific!
23|Well, I can understand that you'd be wary of unexpected happiness.
23|But any time you enter a new arena,
23|there's something to be gained.
23|Something to be gained? Like what?
23|In a word...
23|Money.
23|No, aren't there other things?
23|Is there really anything else in the world?
23|Sure!
23|Like you know...
23|Love!
23|Love
23|Huh? Love?
23|Oh, yeah! I know love.
23|The convenience store was selling it.
23|Love, Now On Sale
23|They were selling it?! At the convenience store?
23|Yup, for 298 yen.
23|A bargain!
23|Talk of money aside, Araragi-san,
23|I've been looking forward to this.
23|What kind of dance will we do during the ED?
23|It's a given that we're dancing?
23|I'm hoping for something like in Cat's Eye,
23|nice and sexy!
23|You're okay with just silhouettes?!
23|Anyway, that's not it, Hachikuji.
23|Oh, right... I guess I can tell you.
23|You know I'm actually a vampire, right?
23|I see, Shuraragi-san.
23|That name's pretty cool,
23|and honestly, I'd like to change mine to it.
23|But Hachikuji,
23|I've told you over and over,
23|my name is Araragi.
23|Sorry! I bit my tongue.
23|No, you did it deliberately.
23|I bwit my twongue!
23|It wasn't deliberate?
23|Seen the Family Mart?
23|No, I don't know where the convenience store is!
23|Is it love?
23|Are you going to buy love?
23|For 298 yen?!
23|I see, a vampire.
23|But what about it?
23|Well, it's really hard to tell
23|my family about it, you know?
23|But I'm not sure it's something I can hide forever.
23|I don't think it's really necessary
23|to just come out and tell them.
23|I think keeping a secret or two from your family is natural.
23|Hachikuji?
23|For one thing, sharing your secret with someone
23|means you involve them in your problems.
23|It may make things easier for you,
23|but your family could end up suffering for it.
23|That's true, isn't it?
23|Right now, what you need is
23|the courage to keep your secret to yourself!
23|That sounds very wise.
23|Well, I'm just making it sound positive
23|by adding the word "courage" to it.
23|Really, it's just a normal secret.
23|That sounds very honest!
23|You can make almost anything
23|sound positive by adding the word "courage."
23|That can't be right.
23|I refuse to believe that Japanese is structured that way.
23|Shall I demonstrate?
23|Bring it.
23|If you can satisfy me,
23|I'll do a handstand, right here.
23|A handstand?
23|Yes...
23|Like getting on your knees to bow, but better.
23|And if you can't satisfy me,
23|then you have to do a handstand here,
23|wearing your skirt!
23|Your kiddy panties will be exposed to public view,
23|until I allow you to stop!
23|Very well.
23|I accept your challenge.
23|I praise your guts, if nothing else.
23|You're like a phoenix to the flame, Araragi-san.
23|No, I'm nothing as cool as that.
23|We'll start with warm-ups.
23|Courage Series
23|The courage to lie to your lover.
23|Not bad...
23|All you're doing is simply lying,
23|but tacking "courage" onto it
23|makes it sound like you're lying for your lover's sake.
23|Even though she hasn't said anything suggesting that.
23|The courage to betray your comrades.
23|What?!
23|Amazing...
23|The end result is that you've betrayed your comrades.
23|But that gives the impression
23|that you've somehow protected them.
23|Even though she hasn't said anything suggesting that!
23|The courage to be a lazy bum.
23|Wh-What?
23|It really can do anything!
23|You're just meaninglessly whiling away your life,
23|but that makes it sound like you've
23|positioned yourself in poverty, all for some greater goal.
23|Even though she hasn't said anything,
23|anything at all, suggesting that!
23|B-But I cannot admit defeat here!
23|The courage to admit defeat.
23|I admit my defeat!
23|I was lulled by the awesomeness of the words
23|into admitting my own defeat!
23|And all I did was admit defeat...
23|Japanese is really simple!
23|Now, Araragi-san.
23|Show me something better than getting on your knees to bow.
23|Very well...
23|I have the courage to do a handstand!
23|Seeing someone your age doing a handstand is actually kind of pathetic...
23|You can stop.
23|I said you could stop, Araragi-san.
23|Actually, please stop, Araragi-san.
23|I'm embarrassed, just being next to you.
23|Why continue your handstand,
23|as if it were a promise made in response to a friend's last request?
23|Well, you know...
23|I was just thinking
23|that if I stood on my hands,
23|from this angle, I can see your panties.
23|Araragi-san, you are a pervert!
23|The courage to accept the label of pervert!
23|So cool!
23|So cool, I'm tempted to have the courage to show you my panties as you wish!
23|Especially the way you continue,
23|even after I kicked you in the face!
23|I can't believe the technology I developed
23|has now been turned against me...
23|So ironic.
23|You grew overconfident, Hachikuji!
23|I have mastered your secret technique!
23|Oh, no.
23|I may have created a monster!
23|But I do apologize for calling them kiddy panties.
23|I never expected
23|you'd be wearing semi-transparent black panties.
23|What are you saying?
23|Take a closer look!
23|Don't say that!
23|It'll ruin my image!
23|I've responded to consumer demand, and am wearing kiddy panties!
23|They have a bunny on them, right?
23|I can't see any bunnies.
23|If you want me to see them, you have to make it easier.
23|L-Like this?
23|Like this?
23|Oh, yeah.
23|We were talking about the need
23|to keep the supernatural a secret, right?
23|You see, Araragi-san,
23|in a way, the supernatural is what's behind the curtain.
23|Behind the curtain?
23|Normally, you only need to see what's happening on stage.
23|That's how reality works.
23|If you don't know,
23|then it's best that you don't.
23|Actually, learning about the supernatural
23|only increases the number of things you don't know.
23|I see.
23|So, Araragi-san...
23|If your family should ever
23|find themselves unfortunately backstage,
23|you can guide them out.
23|But until then, the answer is to do nothing.
23|I see.
23|Anyway, we've been talking a while.
23|Sorry for stopping you, Hachikuji.
23|It's fine.
23|I'm always basically lost.
23|That's not...
23|In a way,
23|I guess I was just walking around, saying,
23|"Isn't Araragi-san's house here?
23|I haven't seen him in a while!
23|Maybe I can see him again."
23|Yeah...
23|Well, bye!
23|Yeah, let's meet again.
23|Hey, Hachikuji.
23|You aren't going to disappear, are you?
23|Because, you know, Oshino's gone.
23|I just wondered if you were going to vanish like he did.
23|You spend so much time worrying about others,
23|the only people you foist
23|your problems on are Shinobu-san and me.
23|I'm honored, really...
23|Hachikuji...
23|Then let me ask you a question, Araragi-san.
23|If I'm ever in really bad trouble again,
23|would you help me?
23|Sure, I would.
23|Of course I would.
23|I won't give anyone else enough time to save you.
23|I can talk to you about my problems?
23|If you don't, I'll get mad!
23|That's just like you.
23|I'm sure there's a reason that,
23|even after I stopped being lost,
23|I stayed here.
23|I won't leave until I know what that reason is.
23|The reason, huh?
23|Well, even if I do go away someday,
23|before I do, I'll come to say goodbye.
23|I see...
23|Black Scene
23|Okay, then you do that.
23|Yeah.
23|I'd be scared of having you mad at me, you know?
24|The older of my sisters, Araragi Karen...
24|A third-year in middle school.
24|Had a birthday at the end of June, turning fifteen.
24|She's always been a tomboy who excels at most sports.
24|But her talents seemed best suited to combat.
24|She earned her black belt in record time.
24|She enjoyed fighting too much to appear truly feminine.
24|I wouldn't call her manly,
24|but the aggressive look in her eye makes her appear boyish.
24|And the younger of sisters, Araragi Tsukihi...
24|A second-year in middle school.
24|Her birthday falls in early April,
24|which makes her fourteen now.
24|Karen is, well,
24|exactly what she looks like.
24|But Tsukihi's appearance belies her true nature.
24|But what's important is that her true nature does not belie her appearance.
24|She looks extremely feminine,
24|but her nature is even more aggressive than Karen's.
24|And she's easily provoked.
24|Her fits could almost be called hysterics.
24|Black Scene
24|The Fire Sisters of Tsuganoki 2nd Middle School...
24|Black Scene
24|The pair has formed what could be considered
24|either a rescue squad or a heroic duo,
24|Black Scene
24|a game that occupies the majority of their time.
24|Black Scene
24|Of course, were you to tell them that...
24|It isn't a game, Nii-chan!
24|We aren't the good guys.
24|We're goodness itself, Onii-chan.
24|...they'd tell you.
24|I can usually anticipate what they'll say.
24|But I can say this without hesitation...
24|Araragi Karen and Araragi Tsukihi,
24|the actions of the Fire Sisters
24|are nothing but a game.
24|Because, my dear sisters,
24|you are irredeemable fakes.
24|Episode 2: Karen Bee, Part 2
24|Sengoku, that's how you do it at home?
24|D-Do what?
24|Those bangs.
24|B-Bangs?
24|Wh-What are you talking about?
24|She's pretending to have no idea.
24|I-I definitely didn't work up the courage
24|to change my hairstyle because you were
24|coming over to my house for the first time.
24|Come in, Koyomi-oniichan.
24|Sure...
24|Hey, Sengoku...
24|Where are your mom and dad?
24|My parents work on Saturdays.
24|Just like mine.
24|So that's why you answered the phone.
24|My room is on the second floor.
24|Black Scene
24|Sengoku, that clo—
24|Don't open it!
24|—set...
24|I'd never forgive anyone, even you, for opening it.
24|Okay, have a seat there,
24|Koyomi-oniichan.
24|There? On the bed?
24|You're sure?
24|Yeah.
24|You can't sit anywhere but on the bed...
24|This room is kind of hot, isn't it?
24|Wh-Why don't you take off your sweatshirt, Koyomi-oniichan?
24|Me?
24|Even if you aren't hot, you still have no choice
24|but to remove your sweatshirt.
24|I have no choice but to remove it, huh?
24|Black Scene
24|Koyomi-oniichan, let's play a King Game.
24|[In a King Game, one person issues orders, of an often sexual nature, to others, referred to by number.]
24|Sengoku, do you even know what a King Game is?
24|It has nothing to do with a deck of cards.
24|I know what it is.
24|It's like Captain's Orders, right?
24|Simon Says
24|The king's word is law!
24|Too political!
24|Well, I've never played one before, so I don't really know.
24|But, Sengoku,
24|you can't have a King Game with only two players.
24|Why not?
24|I'm fine with either role.
24|Giving the orders and taking them.
24|W-Well, let's not play that...
24|Then let's play the Game of Life, Koyomi-oniichan.
24|The Game of Life, huh?
24|Sure, that sounds fun.
24|The word of Life is law!
24|Deep!
24|Oh, yeah.
24|We used to play that at my place, right?
24|Yeah, I remember.
24|Yeah?
24|I never forgot.
24|Koyomi-oniichan will not get dirty thoughts
24|from looking at Sengoku's body.
24|Aren't you glad I'm such a gentleman, Sengoku?
24|Black Scene
24|Time Passes
24|Sengoku, has anything been happening lately?
24|Wh-What do you mean?
24|I mean anything like what happened before.
24|No, I've been fine.
24|I see.
24|But there's some weird charm circulating, as usual.
24|At your school?
24|Yeah, but not just at my school.
24|Among all the middle schoolers.
24|I think Rara-chan and the others are up to something.
24|Up to something?
24|When I talked to her a while ago,
24|she asked about what happened with the snake.
24|And since I couldn't tell her the truth,
24|I didn't say too much.
24|But she was getting others to help her investigate stuff.
24|In other words,
24|it has to do with that charm.
24|But to be precise, that whole
24|curse was basically nonsense, right?
24|In your case, you just chose the wrong way to handle it.
24|Yeah.
24|I was the only one
24|for whom anything actually manifested that way, I think.
24|But that's just a guess.
24|Then...
24|But I don't think they're actually worried
24|about anyone performing the charm at all.
24|I think they probably
24|don't even believe in the supernatural.
24|Yeah, I'm sure.
24|It seems like they're more concerned
24|with the fact that nonsense of that sort is going around.
24|They said they're trying to discover
24|who's spreading it.
24|No one's trying to spread it.
24|And even should they find someone,
24|now that it's spread, it isn't their responsibility.
24|That's just Rara-chan... Or rather, the Fire Sisters.
24|They seemed on the verge of saying
24|that someone had deliberately spread the word for their own reasons.
24|That sounds just like them...
24|Sheesh.
24|I'm gonna have to talk to Karen.
24|It isn't something I have to get involved in...
24|But given the percent
24|of Sengoku Nadeko involved, it's delicate.
24|K-Koyomi-oniichan?
24|It's nothing!
24|I'm fine, Sengoku.
24|Anyway, Sengoku...
24|You look better that way.
24|I mean your bangs.
24|You should do it like that outside.
24|B-But I'm embarrassed!
24|But if you want me to...
24|I'll do my best.
24|Yeah, doing your best is always good.
24|Anyway, we're almost done with the Game of Life.
24|What do you want to do after this?
24|Twister!
24|I don't know Twister.
24|How do you play? Show me.
24|Okay, I'll show you...
24|I'll show your body.
24|Black Scene
24|I can't wait!
24|After that, Sengoku's mom suddenly came home.
24|I-I didn't tell them you were coming over!
24|She'll get mad! She'll get mad!
24|If she sees me dressed this way, she'll think I'm a pervert...
24|I wonder why...
24|I think the fact that there was a problem at her workplace
24|saved something important for me, as a man.
24|It was supposed to be tomorrow, but eh...
24|This is Kanbaru Suruga!
24|Kanbaru Suruga...
24|Primary weapon, accelerator.
24|You're a cyborg?!
24|That voice and joke...
24|It's you, Araragi-sempai.
24|Yeah, but...
24|Hey, you're at home, right?
24|Yes, I am.
24|Would you wait a minute, Araragi-sempai?
24|I'll take my clothes off, this minute.
24|Why?
24|What are you talking about, Araragi-sempai?
24|It may be over the phone, but I'm still speaking to you.
24|Thus, courtesy dictates that I must be naked.
24|Don't speak as though I've never heard of courtesy.
24|And stop trying to find excuses to strip!
24|You've underestimated me.
24|I guess you don't understand how fast I really am.
24|I'm already naked!
24|Already naked?
24|Your perversion has finally gone further
24|than I'm willing to go, Kanbaru!
24|Oh, my...
24|This is my house, and this is my room.
24|No matter what I may wear or don't,
24|that's a decision for me, and no one else.
24|You're right.
24|Sorry.
24|You weren't getting naked outside or anything.
24|I'm sorry for yelling.
24|No, so long as you understand, it's fine.
24|No matter how liberated I feel when naked,
24|I only go outside naked occasionally.
24|You do it occasionally?!
24|Like in a bath.
24|Or with the basketball team...
24|You won't trick me this time...
24|I bet it was at the bath, during your team trip, right?
24|Close.
24|It was on our trip.
24|During our first year, I led a naked team trip.
24|I hope your team gets banned!
24|What's wrong, Araragi-sempai?
24|It was obviously a joke.
24|For you to believe such an obvious lie,
24|you may be even dirtier than I am.
24|Wh-What?
24|Black Scene
24|What's wrong, Kanbaru?
24|I accidently forgot to close the partition to my room...
24|Grandmother
24|And my grandmother came down the hallway.
24|She looked at me with sad eyes,
24|and passed me without missing a step!
24|Well, the granddaughter she raised was on the phone,
24|while stark naked.
24|My life is over...
24|How can I ever talk to her again?
24|Hey, Kanbaru.
24|Sorry to interrupt your emotional trauma,
24|but I unexpectedly have the day off from my test prep.
24|I know I promised to help clean your room tomorrow.
24|But how about today?
24|Sure...
24|That's fine.
24|Whatever day is best for you.
24|Then I'll be right there.
24|Black Scene
24|Oh, it's you, Nii-chan?
24|I thought it was an enemy.
24|Do you have enemies?
24|Jeez.
24|Doing handstands that way, in public...
24|Don't you have any dignity?
24|You should act more like a girl who's going through puberty.
24|What if you get a reputation?
24|I'm not sure I follow,
24|but I think you're trying to avoid talking about yourself.
24|I'm not doing that at all.
24|What are you doing out here?
24|Community service.
24|Just a bit of volunteer work.
24|Volunteer work?
24|You don't even know what that word means, idiot.
24|What are you doing, Nii-chan?!
24|That's dangerous.
24|What's dangerous is what you're doing.
24|And what are you doing?
24|I told you, community service.
24|Who do you think I am?
24|I don't know.
24|Who are you, anyway?
24|Slayer of a thousand demons...
24|Hell's guard dog, the Gumshoe Master!
24|How cool...
24|Super-cool and perfect!
24|I guarantee that, if nothing else, that pose is not cool at all.
24|Well, I'm a brightly burning girl.
24|Burn to death.
24|Black Scene
24|But I will admit that I enjoy the inherent humor
24|of saying cool things in that ridiculous pose.
24|I see, I see...
24|Then we'll make it a running gag of mine.
24|Okay, let's practice.
24|Say something cool. Anything at all.
24|You shall not pass!
24|Cooler than expected.
24|And the reverse...
24|Leave this to me. You go on ahead!
24|Anyway,
24|I'm busy with some stuff right now.
24|Nii-chan, if you want to chat,
24|we'll do it tonight with Tsukihi-chan.
24|Will that work?
24|Hello?
24|Oh, yeah...
24|Nii-chan...
24|It's okay.
24|It looks like this really will be over soon.
24|Seems I'll have a heroic tale
24|to tell tonight!
24|Who'd listen to that?
24|The worst part of my day so far
24|is finding out that you've nearly finished middle school,
24|but still walk on your hands through the city.
24|Bye!
24|Hasta la vista!
24|Suruga's Grandmother: Ah... Be kind to Suruga, Koyomi-kun.
24|K-Kanbaru?
24|Is that you, Araragi-sempai?
24|Wait, Kanbaru!
24|Do not turn over right now...
24|If you turn over, we'll have a big problem!
24|Oh, I apologize for this...
24|I'm embarrassed to be this way in front of you.
24|But for you to open the partition without knocking...
24|That isn't anything like the Araragi-sempai I know,
24|the paragon of virtue.
24|Um, well...
24|I wanted to see you depressed...
24|If such an ugly thing satisfies you, you're free to watch as much as you like.
24|Look long and well.
24|This is who Kanbaru Suruga truly is.
24|With nothing at all concealed.
24|Well, that is...
24|Sorry.
24|Sorry, Kanbaru.
24|Let me take responsibility.
24|Responsibility?
24|What could you mean by responsibility, Araragi-sempai?
24|Let's get married!
24|Wh-Why marriage?
24|Well, even if it was just your back half, I saw you naked.
24|You're skipping a few steps there.
24|By that theory,
24|how many girls would you need to marry?
24|That isn't a very nice thing to say!
24|Araragi-sempai,
24|that's an extraordinarily attractive offer,
24|but you don't need to take responsibility.
24|If you did that, Senjougahara-sempai would get mad at me.
24|Instead, Araragi-sempai, I do have a request...
24|Would you fulfill it?
24|Sure, anything.
24|For today, I'm your slave!
24|I'd like to get dressed. Could you wait in the hall?
24|Kanbaru, what's this?
24|Oh, my team uniform.
24|Come to a Complete Stop
24|I wondered where it had gone.
24|And there it was.
24|No Entry
24|A practice uniform?
24|No, it's a memento from my first year,
24|when we made it to the nationals.
24|Turn it over, and look inside.
24|All of my teammates signed it.
24|Do you not understand the concept of treasuring your memories?
24|My memories are always in my heart.
24|That's a great line, but...
24|Actually, I've only seen you play
24|in a single basketball game...
24|Hey, Kanbaru.
24|Would you put this on?
24|Sure.
24|I've grown out my hair, so I'll look different than I did then.
24|Your hair grows awfully fast...
24|Yeah?
24|No Entry
24|I've heard normal hair grows at
24|a rate of one centimeter per month.
24|But yours has grown at least five.
24|No Entry
24|Well, I'm really erotic.
24|She said it frankly!
24|That's right.
24|I'm so erotic,
24|I thought that "peperoncino"
24|was a dirty word for years.
24|You should have realized that when you ate it!
24|I once misheard "family rate" as "family rape."
24|Family Rape
24|Dangerous Object
24|I mean, I once misheard "family rate" as "family hate."
24|Family Hate
24|That doesn't really make it better!
24|And I remember recently thinking
24|"bracelet" meant "let's take a breath."
24|Erotic
24|That isn't erotic at all. It's just a misunderstanding!
24|"Bracelet,"
24|I said, rather than, "Don't worry," during matches,
24|getting really embarrassed.
24|I'll never forget my teammates' stunned expressions.
24|Stop it...
24|That episode is too embarrassing!
24|Here...Well?
24|Something like this, Araragi-sempai?
24|When I wear this, I feel the way I did back then.
24|Back then?
24|When you played basketball?
24|No Entry
24|No, the naked team trip.
24|You're totally aware of it?!
24|Black Scene
24|The Glasses-Wearing Secretary and the Glasses-Wearing Prince
24|We can throw this one out...
24|I guess it goes in the flammable trash.
24|Araragi-sempai,
24|that is not flammable trash.
24|It may be rotten, but I need it.
24|Black Scene
24|But all of these look the same...
24|Can you tell the difference when you read them?
24|Of course.
24|Watch for Falling Books
24|Any time one isn't familiar with something, it all looks the same.
24|Knowledge and education
24|are required to properly judge a thing.
24|I see.
24|But even still...
24|The Glasses-Wearing Secretary and the Glasses-Wearing Prince
24|I guess they're all handsome.
24|I was just thinking you like 'em handsome...
24|Maybe you aren't really a big pervert.
24|Don't all girls like handsome guys?
24|So it's natural to enjoy seeing handsome guys together.
24|It's basically like an idol group, right?
24|P-Please don't use simplified examples!
24|It's not as though you only like guys who weigh more than 100 kg,
24|or are turned on by the smell of old men.
24|U-Um, well...
24|If you say that to me, there's nothing else I can do...
24|I'll strip!
24|I'll strip right now.
24|No, no, no, no.
24|When you think about it, being underdressed
24|at home is actually pretty normal...
24|And even outside, it's only in a bath, right?
24|I'm sorry for all the things I've said.
24|I don't want you to apologize!
24|Araragi-sempai,
24|listen to what I have to say.
24|And as you, yourself, said on the phone,
24|maybe I'm the bigger pervert...
24|She fell into complete disarray.
24|That's... No!
24|I just happened to have a lot of books like that around there!
24|There's harder BL on a lower stratum!
24|I know that BL is more than just handsome guys!
24|Keep looking!
24|Come on, Kanbaru.
24|If you actually have to look for it, it isn't really you...
24|Now I have no choice but to prove my innocence...
24|Araragi-sempai, prepare yourself!
24|Prepare myself for what?
24|Don't worry...
24|It only hurts at first.
24|It'll feel good soon.
24|Construction
24|You have a pretty nice body yourself.
24|I like these muscles.
24|They feel great to touch!
24|Stop struggling...
24|It makes it harder to remove your underwear!
24|I swore then that
24|no matter when or how I encountered Hachikuji,
24|I would never open the conversation
24|with sexual harassment.
25|It's starting to look a little better.
25|Want to take a break?
25|Yeah, let's!
25|Your cleaning skills are amazing.
25|Perhaps I make my room messy
25|just so I can see your skill.
25|That'd be a pain, so cut it out.
25|You'll make a great wife.
25|I don't want to be a wife!
25|I'd almost want you as my wife...
25|No,
25|I wouldn't want you for a husband.
25|Then you'll marry me?
25|If our positions were reversed.
25|But either way, Senjougahara would kill you.
25|Well, she'd probably kill me, too.
25|But you know, Araragi-sempai...
25|You and Senjougahara-sempai
25|make a good couple.
25|However,
25|I think you'll end up marrying Hanekawa-sempai.
25|Don't say that!
25|And you'll have me for a lover,
25|Koyomi Tsubasa
25|Suruga
25|Nadeko
25|and maybe Sengoku-chan as your #3?
25|Koyomi Suruga
25|Following that logic,
25|Nadeko
25|Tsubasa
25|Mayoi
25|I'm really in love with Hachikuji.
25|Th-That isn't true...
25|I'm marrying Senjougahara someday.
25|Cold Sweat
25|I don't know what to say
25|about your dream proposal.
25|But still, Araragi-sempai,
25|if I really pursued you, you couldn't refuse.
25|T-To marry?
25|Nope.
25|To be your mistress!
25|I would refuse!
25|It's easy for girls to
25|take advantage of your kindness, so be careful.
25|That's what I mean.
25|For now, that's all it is.
25|I like our current relationship.
25|I wouldn't do anything to endanger it.
25|But should you ever do anything to hurt Senjougahara-sempai,
25|I'm certain I would...
25|Actually, if I married Hanekawa,
25|wouldn't Senjougahara kill her, too?
25|I wouldn't want that.
25|Didn't I tell you?
25|I'm more grateful to Hanekawa than to anyone else.
25|Well...
25|Hanekawa-sempai...
25|Hanekawa-sempai and Senjougahara-sempai...
25|Well, I don't think you should worry about that relationship.
25|What?
25|They have their own little world, you know.
25|I'm not terribly pleased about it.
25|But since those two are happy with it,
25|it isn't my place to say anything.
25|Oh, Kanbaru...
25|Wanna play this, while we take a break?
25|Oh, Hanafuda!
25|Shishinden
25|I forgot I had that.
25|But I don't know the rules.
25|I just bought it on a whim, at a department store.
25|Oh, I see...
25|Then we can't play.
25|No, that's not true, Araragi-sempai.
25|If you teach me, I can play!
25|It may surprise you,
25|but I'm good at learning the rules to games.
25|What's wrong, Araragi-sempai?
25|This round, you're the parent.
25|Sorry...
25|I've got a four-hand.
25|That's six points.
25|Koyomi Suruga
25|So, yeah...
25|That was a rare hand, so let's end it here.
25|Wait! Grr...
25|We still have one match left.
25|Don't get so mad...
25|Bracelet! Bracelet!
25|It's just a game.
25|How can you win without even taking it seriously?!
25|But I am winning.
25|It's just a game.
25|You should enjoy it...
25|For example, look at Sengoku.
25|She taught me something called "Twister."
25|She lost to a total newbie like me,
25|but she still seemed really happy.
25|Araragi-sempai,
25|it seems you've not yet recognized
25|the true final boss's existence.
25|What are you talking about?
25|Nothing.
25|It's not for me to say anything.
25|Kanbaru?
25|What is it, Araragi-sempai?
25|We should decide a punishment game first.
25|You're certainly in a hurry.
25|And I intend to ask for a sexual pact...
25|I mean, sexual act.
25|I see.
25|You can order me to die, if you want.
25|Never, ever, start gambling!
25|Episode 3: Karen Bee, Part 3
25|I asked Kanbaru about something I'd been wondering...
25|What she tells her family
25|about her left arm.
25|I tell them it's injured.
25|I don't think it's something I could really explain.
25|But does that work?
25|Unlike my vampirism,
25|your left arm is something they can see.
25|Well, my grandma and grandpa
25|do worry about me, naturally.
25|But despite everything, what happened with
25|my mother puts a wall between me and them.
25|So they never ask anything
25|I wouldn't want them to ask.
25|Either way, I only have to tolerate it
25|for a few more years.
25|Are you a child from this household?
25|No...
25|Actually, I'm not.
25|I apologize.
25|I haven't introduced myself.
25|The caution you've shown a total stranger is extremely appropriate.
25|Treasure it.
25|My name is Kaiki.
25|Kaiki?
25|Yes.
25|"Kai," like a mound of clamshells.
25|"Ki," like a dead tree.
25|My name is Araragi.
25|The kanji are, uh...
25|No need to explain.
25|It's a name I just heard said.
25|But I suppose if I'm a dead tree,
25|you must be a sapling.
25|Well, if you need something at Kanbaru's place...
25|You're polite, for a child these days.
25|And kind, too. Interesting.
25|But your kindness is wasted on me.
25|And I've no particular business with this household.
25|However...
25|I'd heard that the Gaen child lived here.
25|I haven't anything to do here, but I thought I might take a look.
25|That's all.
25|Gaen?
25|Isn't that the maiden name of Kanbaru's mother?
25|Then her child would be Kanbaru Suruga?
25|But I've wasted my time.
25|I hardly feel any aura at all.
25|One-third, I'd say...
25|It won't cause problems if I ignore it.
25|No, I have no choice but to ignore it.
25|Unfortunately, there's no money to be made.
25|The lesson for me here is that
25|even if the truth is as one suspects,
25|it may still be worthless.
25|Um...
25|No...
25|He's totally different from that slacker, Oshino.
25|He was more like Guillotine Cutter.
25|Well, both Oshino and Guillotine Cutter
25|were totally different types, but...
25|I'll follow him.
25|Maybe it's intuition,
25|but I have a feeling that it's a bad idea to get involved with him.
25|Those strange, depressing funeral clothes.
25|But there was something far beyond that...
25|Something ominous.
25|Ominous...
25|And threatening.
25|A Threat
25|Hey! Senjougahara!
25|Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
25|Don't do things that will seriously depress me!
25|No Entry
25|Hey, Senjougahara.
25|I don't know any boy who'd neglect his studies,
25|to wander around here.
25|Well... Y-You've misunderstood.
25|Silence. I most certainly have not.
25|Running from my tutelage is one thing, but to run from Hanekawa-san's,
25|you must be a true coward.
25|I'm disappointed in you.
25|No, no.
25|Hanekawa's busy today, and couldn't make it.
25|I'm tired of excuses, incompetent fool.
25|In the end, you're all talk, Araragi-kun.
25|The fact that a man like you won my heart
25|will shame me for the rest of my life.
25|You say things that would drive any other man to suicide,
25|all like it's nothing, you know?
25|Insect.
25|Gahara-san! Gahara-san!
25|What is it, Churaragi-kun.
25|Don't say my name like an obscure regional Okinawa word!
25|My name is Araragi!
25|And that's Hachikuji's gag!
25|Sorry! I bit my tongue.
25|No, you did it deliberately.
25|I bit my tongue, and you can die.
25|She really did do it deliberately!
25|Don't get the wrong idea.
25|I actually hate human garbage like you.
25|Are you just taking advantage of your tsundere status
25|to say what you really think?!
25|But they say a woman's better off
25|with an unloved man, versus a man who loves.
25|That isn't quite right!
25|An Unloved Man
25|It's a joke.
25|Everyone loves you, and you're super-popular.
25|Watch your head.
25|Danger Zone
25|Danger
25|Stare.
25|Three. Or maybe it's five?
25|Wh-What's that?
25|The number of girls you've played with today.
25|Six, to be completely accurate.
25|Grandma
25|So, with that in the open,
25|Danger Zone
25|Danger
25|everyone loves you, and you're super-popular.
25|Don't worry, Araragi-san.
25|Danger Zone
25|Danger
25|I may not seem it,
25|but I'm quite tolerant regarding adultery.
25|I'm not committing adultery.
25|I'm not even engaging in the "adult" part.
25|So regardless of what you play, with whom,
25|that is your choice.
25|But if any of it ever gets the slightest bit serious,
25|I'll kill you.
25|Danger Zone
25|Danger
25|Don't worry.
25|I won't let you die alone.
25|I'll send the other woman right after you.
25|Why don't you just die, too?
25|Then I'll send Kanbaru, so you don't get lonely!
25|What do you think Kanbaru is?
25|An underclassman I can use however I like.
25|A cruel definition, stated without hesitation!
25|A joke.
25|Kanbaru is a cute little underclassman.
25|And I don't believe in life after death at all.
25|I see...
25|I just wanted you to understand that
25|this is what it means to date me.
25|I get it.
25|I wouldn't cheat, anyway.
25|Okay.
25|Very well, then.
25|As long as you don't forget to whom you belong,
25|that's fine.
25|I put a decent amount of effort into being your woman.
25|If possible, I'd like you to do the same.
25|Effort, huh?
25|I am...
25|I've never forgotten to whom I belong.
25|I see...
25|By the way, Araragi-kun,
25|Danger Zone
25|that said, I'd like to be certain that you know this...
25|Speaking as a girlfriend, it's actually quite wonderful
25|to have such a popular boyfriend.
25|Too close to what she's really thinking!
25|Are you going somewhere?
25|I finished my shopping, and I'm heading home.
25|Speaking of which, what are you doing out here?
25|This isn't your normal territory.
25|Can't you tell?
25|Unfortunately, I've never studied the actions of microscopic organisms.
25|But if I had to guess regardless, given what I know about you,
25|I'd say you're returning from some misdemeanor.
25|Do you think I just go out and commit misdemeanors?
25|I'm on my way back from Kanbaru's.
25|I see.
25|You were committing misdemeanors at Kanbaru's.
25|I was not!
25|Oh?
25|I thought you saw Kanbaru naked.
25|I... I did not!
25|At least, not from the front.
25|I simply thought a minor detail like that wasn't worth sharing.
25|Come to think of it,
25|I saw a weird guy in front of Kanbaru's house.
25|Oh?
25|When did they hang a mirror in front of Kanbaru's house?
25|He was strange...
25|Kind of ill-omened.
25|Ill-omened?
25|His name was...
25|Kaiki?
25|Was that it?
25|Black Scene
25|Five
25|Four
25|Three
25|Two
25|One
25|7/30 Early Morning
25|Do you know this Kaiki guy?
25|I'd prefer that you not ask.
25|If I shouldn't, then I won't.
25|But that isn't really the case, is it?
25|If you have to do all this...
25|It was just to protect me.
25|Senjougahara kidnapped me
25|in order to protect me.
25|For you to go to these lengths,
25|it must be a big deal.
25|You think so?
25|Personally, I'd say that it's likely
25|that I'd kidnap you, with even the slightest of pretexts.
25|Yeah...
25|Kaiki Deishuu.
25|That's his name.
25|Kaiki is an uncommon name.
25|And if you saw him and "ill-omened" sprang to mind, that's him.
25|I know no other man who suits
25|that term so well.
25|Yes,
25|just as you know nothing at all...
25|I hadn't imagined he'd return to this town...
25|Surprising, inexplicable...
25|Honestly, I didn't expect it in the slightest.
25|What's he like?
25|It's unusual for you to have such antipathy
25|for someone.
25|Kaiki is a fraud.
25|You and Oshino-san solved my problem,
25|if you recall?
25|Yeah.
25|And did I not tell you?
25|How, before you introduced me to Oshino-san,
25|I met with five con men.
25|Three Four Two One Five
25|Kaiki was one of them.
25|The first.
25|I understand.
25|His feel was akin to that of Oshino and Guillotine Cutter.
25|Those two are similar by virtue of their expertise in the supernatural.
25|And Kaiki...
25|Kaiki Deishuu is just like them.
25|Regardless of whether he's for real or a fake...
25|He's a fake,
25|but he's a master con man.
25|My entire family and I have suffered greatly at his hands.
25|He did a few tricks, took our money,
25|and vanished without helping at all.
25|But that's a minor issue.
25|So, what isn't minor?
25|I do not
25|want you involved with him.
25|That's all.
25|I will no longer relinquish that which is important to me.
25|I won't lose anything else.
25|Therefore,
25|I am going to protect you, Araragi-kun.
25|Is this Kaiki that much of a problem?
25|Why do you want me to keep away?
25|Hmm...
25|He's too much for a man of justice like yourself.
25|A man of justice?
25|I'm not one of the Fire Sisters.
25|Until I know at least what he's after,
25|why he's returned,
25|I'd like you to please remain here.
25|No.
25|Even if he isn't here for any specific reason,
25|I'd like you to stay here until he leaves.
25|What if he moves here?
25|If he moves here...
25|Then you'll have to spend the rest of your life in this room.
25|Hey, Gahara-san!
25|Or...
25|I could kill Kaiki.
25|Wait.
25|I know. I'll go "click" on him.
25|"Click"?
25|Cute sounds do not make it okay!
25|Not Okay
25|And it isn't okay!
25|Anyway, what is this Kaiki guy...
25|Can I look at that?
25|Wait, you're groping around too much!
25|Where are you touching me?
25|It's hard to reach, deep in your pocket.
25|My pockets aren't that deep.
25|I see.
25|Neither your life nor your pockets are that deep, right?
25|Do you have to hurt me, to find my cell phone?
25|From: Younger Little Sister Subject: Help Me
25|Araragi-kun?
25|Where are you going?
25|I've got somewhere to be.
25|That's enough playing around.
25|Sorry, but I'm going home.
25|Do you think you can?
25|I do. It's my home.
25|And my family.
25|Koyomi Voice /Dialogue
25|Just so we're clear,
25|I'm not such a coward that I'd hesitate because I'm facing a vampire.
25|Nor kind enough to hesitate because I'm facing my lover.
25|I know that.
25|It's why I like you.
25|If you want to get past me, you'll have to defeat me.
25|Can you do that?
25|I can.
25|Those lines don't work unless they're said together.
25|Just as you claim to wish to protect me,
25|I have something I want to protect.
25|Do you expect those words to convince me?
25|They don't need to, right?
25|I don't know about that.
25|I'd prefer that you not consider me to be the understanding type of woman.
25|But, Senjougahara...
25|Then when you fell in love, what did you like about me?
25|Can you boldly claim to love me, even if I do nothing here?
25|Oh, no.
25|That's really cool.
25|If I were a man, I'd love you.
25|Stay a woman, and love me anyway!
25|I do.
25|Hello?
25|I'm busy right now.
25|N-No...
25|That's a misunderstanding...
25|I never said a word about that.
25|Wait a second...
25|You don't have to do that.
25|That wasn't the deal.
25|Stop, please...
25|Give me some time.
25|All right.
25|I'll do everything you say.
25|You can go home, Araragi-kun.
25|Are you sure?
25|I'm sure.
25|A-And Araragi-kun...
25|Well, you know...
25|I'm s-sorr... I'm sorry...
25|Hey, Gahara-san?
25|Who were you talking to, by the way?
25|White Scene
25|To be continued.
25|Hanekawa-san.
26|I'm right!
26|Karen-chan...
26|For now, just tell me what happened.
26|Weren't you going to have a heroic tale for me?
26|I'll ask once more, bigger little sister...
26|Tell me what happened.
26|Nope!
26|Araragi-kun?
26|Araragi-kun, you were really upset when
26|my father hit me, right?
26|So why are you about to hit your little sister?
26|I think physical punishment is
26|appropriate to some circumstances.
26|If you can give some reason,
26|which will satisfy Karen-chan,
26|even after you've hit her,
26|then it's all right.
26|I'm sorry.
26|Why are you apologizing to me?
26|I'm very sorry.
26|I got too emotional.
26|Hey, Tsubasa-san,
26|don't be mad at my brother.
26|This one was my fault.
26|And if he'd hit me, I would've hit him back.
26|I see.
26|Then I guess my help wasn't needed.
26|That's right, Tsubasa-san.
26|But I don't think you'd have been able to hit him back.
26|If not, I'd have bitten him.
26|You don't know how strong my teeth are.
26|Onii-chan, don't be mad, okay?
26|Hanekawa-san is
26|helping the Fire Sisters with this...
26|I'm very mad!
26|Araragi-kun, keep it down.
26|You'll wake up your parents.
26|And I didn't realize
26|you yelled at your sisters that way.
26|I'm surprised.
26|They're pretending to be good in front of Hanekawa.
26|This is really hard!
26|Hanekawa-san, don't get mad at Onii-chan.
26|He's just worried that we're
26|causing trouble for you.
26|Jeez.
26|Araragi-kun,
26|I'm cooperating with Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan
26|of my own free will.
26|So don't blame them.
26|The Araragi-kun I know wouldn't get
26|angry with his sisters for no reason, would he?
26|Okay, okay.
26|I won't get mad.
26|I promise.
26|And you won't tell Mom and Dad?
26|I won't.
26|So explain. What was the big deal,
26|and what happened after that?
26|Hmm, what happened then, I wonder...
26|Hanekawa, would you go to my room for a second?
26|Nii-chan is trying to get Tsubasa-san into his room!
26|I will kill you someday.
26|All right. Let's go.
26|It's okay, Karen-chan... Tsukihi-chan.
26|You did the right thing.
26|Once he talks to me, I'm sure he'll understand.
26|I'll tell him everything, so don't worry.
26|Tsubasa-san! Hanekawa-san!
26|I trust your brother.
26|Hey, big one.
26|What is it, little one?
26|You're probably right.
26|You always are.
26|I won't deny that.
26|But that's all you are.
26|You're never strong.
26|And if you're not strong, you'll lose.
26|You do enough martial arts to know that.
26|The first requirement of being a hero isn't being right.
26|It's being strong.
26|That's why the hero always wins.
26|You need to learn that.
26|Until you do, what you're doing is just a game.
26|And you'll only be fakes.
26|Episode 4: Karen Bee, Part 4
26|It's kind of different...
26|The way you worry about your sisters,
26|or Senjougahara-san,
26|or Mayoi-chan,
26|or Kanbaru-san,
26|or Sengoku-chan, is totally different
26|than how you worry about me.
26|I don't know how to explain it.
26|It feels more desperate.
26|Desperate?
26|It's like a totally different personality.
26|You were pretty hard
26|on them back there, weren't you?
26|"You're only right, you aren't strong."
26|It sounded like
26|you were telling yourself that, too.
26|You're saying they bother me because I have the same problem?
26|I'm sure this isn't what you want to hear.
26|But I think it's more like
26|you bother yourself.
26|Hanekawa, you've only known them for
26|a month or so, so you might not understand.
26|But I've lived with Karen-chan for fifteen years,
26|and Tsukihi-chan for fourteen.
26|And from that experience, I can tell you...
26|Hanekawa?
26|Sorry, sorry.
26|But you call them "-chan," huh?
26|B-Big mistake!
26|Don't worry about it.
26|I call them that, too.
26|I-It isn't like that.
26|I was just, you know, imitating how you talk...
26|That's right.
26|It's a type of rhetorical trick,
26|and normally, I don't...
26|Th-That aside.
26|Let's get to the point, Hanekawa.
26|We might not have much time.
26|That's true...
26|But I at least know the beginning, right?
26|They were looking for the source of the charm
26|that's circulating among the middle school kids.
26|Huh? How did you know?
26|Sengoku told me.
26|Unfortunately, my little sisters...
26|Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan!
26|My little sis—
26|Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan!
26|Black Scene
26|Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan are
26|famous among middle school kids.
26|So Sengoku hears about anything they're up to.
26|I see.
26|Come to think of it,
26|wasn't Sengoku-chan one of that charm's victims?
26|The only victim.
26|Not the only victim.
26|But the biggest victim.
26|"You can sit on the bed." "Araragi-kun, you shouldn't
26|But the charms are having
26|just ask a girl to your bed like that." "Why not?"
26|Sengoku asked me to sit on her bed. She even said I couldn't sit anywhere else.
26|a lot of negative effects.
26|I sit in my chair. "By the way, Hanekawa, it's late. Why are you in your uniform?"
26|Right. I'd been meaning to say something, but hadn't had the chance.
26|Hanekawa Tsubasa is always in her uniform. "I'm used to you wearing your uniform over break,
26|Negative effects?
26|so it's fine, but... Don't you have any other clothes? I've never seen you not wearing your uniform!"
26|Mostly in terms of relationships.
26|"You saw me in my PJ's." "Pajamas don't count."
26|I'd also seen her in her underwear. But that doesn't really count, either. What I want to see
26|is what Hanekawa picks to wear when she's going out somewhere!
26|But when we looked into it, we found that
26|When will I ever see them? "Well, there's no real reason. I met Tsukihi-chan this evening,
26|and then we came here. Maybe I should start the story there?"
26|all the charms going around were curses.
26|"Yeah, thanks."
26|There was a definite trend.
26|Their guess, that someone was deliberately spreading them,
26|probably was just a guess.
26|But even so, it wasn't completely wrong.
26|By the way,
26|how long have you been going around with them?
26|I haven't been going around with them.
26|Once in a while, they ask me for help, and I do.
26|To answer the question of how long it's been...
26|Hmm,
26|I suppose since the start of summer vacation.
26|So you helped them.
26|In other words, you found out who was behind it.
26|Basically, it was none other than Hanekawa Tsubasa
26|who was calling Karen's phone that time.
26|Black Scene
26|I'd prefer you didn't try and act like this is my fault...
26|That's what worried Oshino about you...
26|That you're too smart,
26|and you'll always find the answer.
26|I suppose so.
26|But that doesn't mean I can not do my best.
26|Yeah.
26|Just as I, Karen-chan, or Tsukihi-chan...
26|Just as I, Karen-chan, or Tsukihi-chan
26|must accept our weakness,
26|you must accept your strength.
26|Black Scene
26|So then what? Karen-chan went to talk
26|to whoever was behind this,
26|and they did something to her?
26|That's right.
26|I was busy with something else,
26|and only arrived later.
26|So I didn't see the culprit directly.
26|If only I could have met up with Karen-chan earlier,
26|I'd have been able to help.
26|Karen-chan said who it was, right?
26|Um...
26|Some weird, ill-omened guy
26|named Kaiki Deishuu.
26|Black Scene
26|I decided to leave my sisters in Hanekawa's care,
26|and take a bath.
26|To be honest, I needed time to cool off,
26|or I was just going to yell at them again.
26|That's right, Hanekawa...
26|What were you talking about
26|over the phone, with Senjougahara?
26|Oh, that?
26|Tsukihi-chan sent a message on her cell phone.
26|But she said it was strange that there was no response.
26|So I called.
26|For all they might say, they trust you.
26|Well, I figured that was what happened.
26|But how did you manage to persuade Senjougahara?
26|It was nothing, really.
26|When I heard her voice,
26|I guessed most of what was happening.
26|So I just made a small request.
26|A small request?
26|"If you won't be a good girl,
26|I'll ask Araragi-kun to be my boyfriend."
26|Scary...
26|Um...
26|Since you've seen me naked now,
26|I guess that means I'll have to marry you, too.
26|My master.
26|Shinobu!
26|Ha ha!
26|What's wrong with you?
26|You look like a pigeon that's been hit by a peashooter.
26|Or maybe a vampire that's been hit by a silver bullet?
26|Is it that rare for me to talk?
26|Or maybe you thought I'd forgotten how?
26|Shinobu, y-you...
26|Got bored.
26|I'm normally pretty talkative.
26|You know that.
26|I'm not going to keep my mouth shut forever.
26|You should understand that, my master.
26|Thank you.
26|What are you talking about?
26|Oh...
26|Um... These! These chains...
26|Weren't you the one who cut them?
26|Was I?
26|Ha ha!
26|I really don't remember.
26|But those arms look pretty stupid.
26|Let's see.
26|No need to thank me.
26|I just do what I feel like.
26|Always have, always will...
26|And this time, purely by chance,
26|and I assure you it was just chance,
26|your wishes and mine coincided,
26|my master.
26|Shinobu, hey...
26|Hair.
26|My hair.
26|Wh-What about your hair?
26|Wash my hair.
26|I feel like trying this shampoo stuff, for fun.
26|From your shadow, I've seen you do it,
26|and I always thought it looked fun.
26|Can I touch you?
26|How can you wash my hair without touching me?
26|Okay, I'll give you some hair treatment, too.
26|Hey...
26|Stop.
26|Don't say a word.
26|You won't forgive me,
26|and I'll never forgive you.
26|And that's fine.
26|Neither of us forgives the other.
26|That's fine.
26|We can't let the past be mere water under the bridge.
26|Even so, there's no reason that we can't come together.
26|That's the conclusion I've come to, after thinking
26|for these past three or four months.
26|What do you think, my master?
26|I'm surprised to hear that you were thinking that.
26|You've been thinking for yourself, haven't you?
26|I've been in your shadow.
26|So I know.
26|I can't be sullen forever.
26|I'm not so small a person.
26|And it seems you'll never get this unless I tell you directly.
26|I do like pon-de-ring.
26|However...
26|Golden chocolate is my favorite!
26|So if you're going to buy two, buy those.
26|Got it.
26|A wreathe-fire bee.
26|A supernatural variant of the Asian giant hornet.
26|Is that...
26|It's the monster that's afflicting your colossal sister.
26|Bigger sister. Not colossal.
26|Just so we're clear, this isn't my knowledge.
26|It's that kid's.
26|Can you understand how I felt?
26|That sleazy little brat spent
26|every hour of every day filling my head
26|with useless stories of ghosts and monsters.
26|And I had to sit there and listen,
26|without saying a word!
26|That's horrible!
26|Black Scene
26|And this is one of the stories he told me.
26|The wreathe-fire bee.
26|I think
26|it dates back to around the fourteenth or fifteenth century.
26|A type of infectious disease with no known cause.
26|The disease starts with a
26|fever so high that it renders its victims unable to move,
26|proceeding until their death.
26|In the end, hundreds of people did die.
26|It was a long time before a famous onmyoji stopped it.
26|Supposedly, this was written in some scroll or another.
26|"They were stung by a bee that could not be touched,
26|and their bodies were wreathed in flames," it said.
26|Karen is the type
26|who hates to show weakness.
26|And I'll be honest when I say I didn't notice a thing.
26|But she was under considerable stress.
26|She was running a bad fever.
26|Hanekawa said she felt like,
26|she was covered in flames.
26|In other words, she was really sick.
26|Jeez...
26|So that's why Hanekawa was covering for her.
26|I still think it's her own fault.
26|Her own fault?
26|You're really tough on your family...
26|Well, I've been watching for a long time,
26|so I can't say this surprises me.
26|But even so,
26|while I'm not certain I agree
26|with your former class president,
26|I really am surprised.
26|Former class president?
26|She's still class president, you know.
26|I don't think I'm being harsh.
26|But either way, I guess this Kaiki guy
26|used a supernatural monster to poison my sister.
26|I don't know if that's possible, but...
26|It's possible.
26|Doable, certainly.
26|But...
26|If we believe what your tsundere told us,
26|Kaiki was a fake and a con man.
26|That's true...
26|Of course,
26|there's no reason
26|a fake can't do what the real thing would.
26|And it's possible for a fake
26|to be more real than the real thing.
26|True...
26|Certainly,
26|it's possible for someone to be
26|unskilled as a specialist, but still a master con artist.
26|Unskilled as a specialist...
26|Black Scene
26|But in that case,
26|they'd be an even bigger problem than someone who's good at it.
26|Anyone who would bend the supernatural to their will without the
26|proper talents isn't acting as a normal person would.
26|Their lack of skill isn't the issue.
26|They're not even human.
26|It would be more accurate to say
26|that they themselves are a supernatural monster.
26|Well, I can ask Senjougahara about that.
26|In fact, I don't have a choice.
26|The problem is how to get her...
26|Well, I suppose there's no point in faking this in front of you.
26|Karen-chan...
26|How to get her symptoms down.
26|Shinobu, could you eat her disease?
26|Unfortunately...
26|The disease is merely the result.
26|I could make a tasty snack of the bee,
26|but I can't eat the result of a bee sting.
26|That's right.
26|Hmm...
26|Then what?
26|Did Oshino say anything about dealing with a wreathe-fire bee?
26|Did he?
26|I think he might have,
26|but his lectures tended to wander all over the place...
26|Come to think of it,
26|it's been a long time since I last had a bath.
26|Ha ha.
26|Has it?
26|Yup.
26|Maybe four hundred years.
26|A scale beyond my power to imitate.
26|What are you staring at?
26|If you're staring this closely at a young girl's naked body,
26|does that make you a true pervert?
26|No, that's not what I...
26|Your passionate gaze
26|is stimulating my imagination a little bit.
26|Nothing exciting...
26|For example,
26|what do you think would happen if I started to scream
26|so loudly that the whole house could hear?
26|Just stuff like that.
26|Of course, if you were to offer me
26|a giant pile of donuts to keep my mouth shut,
26|I would be willing to negotiate.
26|Go ahead and try.
26|You and I are one.
26|Since you can't leave my shadow,
26|it'll be bad for you, too.
26|If nothing else,
26|you'll never get any more Mister Donuts.
26|Ha ha.
26|I see, then.
26|So that's your answer. I guess you've grown up a little, my master.
26|Onii-chan, how long will you be taking that bath?
26|You were going to listen to my story next, right?
26|Umm...
26|Huh?
26|Onii-chan, where's that girl?
26|Girl?
26|What are you talking about?
26|Don't say nonsensical things during an emergency.
26|Stupid girl...
26|Maybe I imagined it.
26|Definitely!
26|There was no girl with bright golden hair, pale white skin, and a flat chest,
26|who spoke in a haughty, old-style voice,
26|but appeared to be around eight years old.
26|You imagined it.
26|Really...
26|Well, whatever.
26|I'll let it slide.
26|Anyway, Onii-chan, your bath is taking quite a while.
26|How long will you be?
26|I'll be out in a second.
26|Wait in the living room.
26|Right...
26|And learn to knock.
26|You've never said that before!
26|Since when did you stop being a kid?
26|Don't get cocky, just because you have some muscle now!
26|Black Scene
26|Ha ha.
26|That was scary...
26|You have a very violent sister.
26|Shut up.
26|By the way, I'm sure this isn't something the kid mentioned...
26|In fact, he deliberately kept it secret.
26|But when do you suppose you're going to die?
26|What does that mean?
26|Well, you know...
26|You're mostly human,
26|but at the same time, you're still part vampire.
26|What does that mean for your lifespan?
26|Your toughness may have reverted to human levels.
26|But it's possible that your lifespan remains that of a vampire.
26|You retain some of your healing ability.
26|It's possible you'll live, not four hundred,
26|but five hundred years like me.
26|And your lover,
26|your friends,
26|your junior classmate,
26|your little sisters...
26|All of them are going to die and disappear.
26|And in the end, it'll just be you and me.
26|No matter what bonds you forge with others,
26|time will tear them apart.
26|Well?
26|Doesn't thinking about it make you sick?
26|So here's a plan...
26|Why don't you kill me,
26|and go back to being a human for real?
26|Don't be silly.
26|It's just like you said.
26|I won't forgive you,
26|and you won't forgive me.
26|That's all there is to it.
26|And we're done discussing this.
26|There's nothing left to say.
26|We live until we die.
26|Very well, then.
26|Pray I don't kill you in your sleep,
26|my master.
26|Regardless, my life is well past its prime.
26|I'll while away some of my
26|remaining time beside you, as your shadow.
26|But I've no intention of getting along.
26|Lower your guard, and I'll kill you, then and there.
26|And so, little by little,
26|Shinobu and I came to a reconciliation.
27|Where's the big one?
27|Hanekawa-san's looking after her.
27|Then tell me the details.
27|Sure, okay.
27|But will you promise me something first?
27|Are you in a position to make demands?
27|Sure, I am. I'm your little sister.
27|And I'm your big brother, so I can refuse them.
27|Fine. Forget it.
27|By the way, what were you going to ask me to do?
27|Not to get mad at Karen-chan.
27|No.
27|You can be mad at me,
27|but don't get mad at Karen-chan.
27|I'm getting mad at both of you.
27|You can be mad at Karen-chan,
27|but please don't get mad at me.
27|I'm already mad.
27|So start talking, and get it off your chest.
27|You think you're so cool.
27|You promised you wouldn't get mad
27|when Hanekawa-san was around.
27|Do you have any regrets, Onii-chan?
27|Regrets?
27|Of course I do.
27|Does anyone not?
27|Well, I don't know...
27|I guess I'm not the type to regret things.
27|I bet.
27|You two sisters are like that.
27|But that means that sometimes,
27|I regret that I didn't regret something
27|when I should have.
27|Not that it matters.
27|I guess you really want a strangling...
27|No, that's not it...
27|Then get to the point.
27|I know, Onii-chan...
27|I'll tell you something cool.
27|Something cool?
27|You know how I always say I'm "platinum" mad?
27|It was originally "pretty" mad.
27|So it doesn't mean that I'm so mad,
27|the word "platinum" comes to mind.
27|I've never heard you say "platinum" mad.
27|How come you don't know?
27|I'm platinum mad!
27|You're clearly extremely upset!
27|And stop trying to cleverly change the subject.
27|Okay, Onii-chan.
27|Then why don't you tell me something you regret?
27|I want to hear it.
27|Just telling you straight out would be kind of upsetting.
27|So maybe we could like, share secrets?
27|Like we were on a school trip or something!
27|Idiot...
27|Still, what I regret, huh?
27|It's hard to come up with something,
27|now that I think about it.
27|Like, something that's kind of embarrassing.
27|Like... Oh...
27|Why don't you have any friends?
27|I have friends now!
27|Do you?
27|How many?
27|Let me tell you...
27|Five!
27|Wow, that seriously scared me.
27|Poor onii-chan...
27|You're going to die of loneliness!
27|Don't be so mean to your brother!
27|Anyway, I have some now,
27|but you're asking why I didn't have any for a while.
27|Well, here's what I used to think.
27|If you make friends, that means your human hardness—
27|No, I've already heard enough embarrassing stuff.
27|I'm sorry I asked.
27|Don't apologize yet!
27|I haven't said anything embarrassing!
27|Stop it, Onii-chan!
27|That's enough!
27|You needn't reopen the wounds anymore!
27|Stop it... It's over!
27|It's not over!
27|Araragi-kun, I can hear you from the second floor!
27|And I can hear you talking about something
27|that really doesn't sound too important.
27|Could you be a little more quiet?
27|Yeah, sorry.
27|I'll be more care...
27|Episode 5: Karen Bee, Part 5
27|Let's talk about Araragi Karen for a while.
27|Of course, this is just based on what
27|I heard from Tsukihi and Hanekawa.
27|So it may differ slightly from what happened.
27|Welcome, young lady.
27|My name is Kaiki.
27|"Kai," like a mound of clamshells.
27|"Ki," like a dead tree. What's your name?
27|Araragi Karen.
27|The "kozato" radical, with the kanji for possibility.
27|"It is good."
27|And "ki," like a young tree.
27|And my given name means "to admire the flame."
27|Karen.
27|An excellent name.
27|Be grateful to your parents.
27|So, which are you?
27|Do you want to learn a charm?
27|Or have one undone?
27|The former is 10,000 yen.
27|The latter, 20,000.
27|Neither.
27|I've come here to punch you!
27|To punch me.
27|So the message you sent me was a fake,
27|and this is a trap.
27|I see.
27|Well done.
27|Of course, I don't believe that
27|you were the one who did it.
27|I can't imagine a simpleton like you
27|Black Scene
27|being able to reach me.
27|Not many people could.
27|Only someone who's a touch abnormal
27|could get this far.
27|What you're doing is a giant pain in the butt.
27|You don't need me to explain, do you?
27|A pain?
27|I'm giving you kids what you want.
27|How you use it is your responsibility.
27|Our responsibility?
27|How is it our responsibility?
27|How dare you?!
27|You're ruining people's relationships...
27|What are you thinking?
27|What am I thinking?
27|Quite a deep question.
27|Unfortunately, I'll have to respond with a shallow answer.
27|I'm doing it for the money, naturally.
27|Money?
27|Money makes the world go round.
27|I suppose you've come here out of
27|some primitive sense of justice.
27|But that was a mistake.
27|You could have earned 100,000 yen for this.
27|The lesson for you here is that working for free
27|isn't worth it.
27|No one hired me!
27|I'm not here because someone asked me to be!
27|I see...
27|Then you should have had someone ask you.
27|Even if someone had, I wouldn't have taken their money!
27|So young...
27|I'm not at all jealous, though.
27|What's wrong?
27|You're shaking, Araragi.
27|I'm not shaking...
27|Araragi, you've heard what I wanted.
27|Now it's your turn.
27|What do you want?
27|I told you already.
27|I came here to punch you!
27|Just to punch me?
27|I'll kick you, too!
27|Violence, then?
27|Force!
27|And I'll make you stop this.
27|Selling this crap to middle schoolers?
27|What are you thinking?
27|And you call yourself an adult?!
27|I'm an adult, yes.
27|And of course I'm selling it to them...
27|I'm a con man.
27|Aren't you embarrassed, selling charms to middle schoolers?
27|Not at all.
27|Children are simple to fool.
27|That's all.
27|But, Araragi, if you want to stop me,
27|punches and kicks are useless.
27|The fastest way would be to bring money.
27|My target for this little business is 3,000,000 yen.
27|3,000,000 Yen
27|I've waited over two months for it to take root.
27|Any less, and it wouldn't be worth my time.
27|And you call yourself human?
27|Unfortunately, I am human, yes.
27|I'm willing to sacrifice my life to protect
27|what's dear to me.
27|Just as you fill your heart through good deeds,
27|I fill my bank account with evil ones.
27|Is there really a difference?
27|A-A difference?
27|No, there's no difference at all.
27|Your activities may make someone happier.
27|But the same is true
27|if I take the money I've earned and use it
27|to grease the gears of a capitalist economy.
27|The lesson for you here is that
27|just as there isn't a problem that can't be solved by being right,
27|there isn't a problem that can't be solved by money.
27|The same is true of my victims, yes?
27|They paid me in money.
27|This means that they recognized
27|money as an object of value.
27|Is the same not true of you?
27|Or did you not pay
27|in money when you bought that jacket?
27|D-Don't talk about the jacket!
27|Just give me your answer...
27|Do you want to be punched?
27|Or...
27|I don't want to be punched.
27|Nor do I want to be kicked.
27|I dislike pain.
27|So,
27|here is a present for you, a bee.
27|It's working quite well.
27|You must have an active imagination.
27|The lesson for you here is to assume
27|that any person you see is a con man.
27|Learn to doubt others.
27|Did you think I would beg for forgiveness?
27|Then you're just a fool.
27|If you want me to have a change of heart,
27|bring some cash.
27|I'd be willing to discuss it for 10,000,000 yen.
27|What did you do?
27|What did you do to me?!
27|Something bad.
27|Of course, nothing is free.
27|I'll take money for it.
27|4,000 yen? I suppose that will do.
27|I'll throw in our little chat as a bonus.
27|I suppose I can leave some change for train fare home...
27|Oh, you already have a ticket.
27|Then you won't need this change.
27|In a moment, the poison will take hold,
27|and you'll be able to move.
27|I recommend using a cell to call for help.
27|In the meantime, I'll make my escape.
27|Of course, I'll continue what I was doing.
27|But from now on, I'll avoid meeting my customers directly.
27|An excellent lesson...
27|Farewell.
27|Black Scene
27|Araragi-kun, are you upset?
27|About what?
27|Well, you know...
27|I was the one who tracked him down.
27|Are you mad about what happened to Karen-chan?
27|I wouldn't say I'm mad.
27|But I'd like to say that if you were going to
27|help the Fire Sisters, you should have told me.
27|But wouldn't you have gotten mad?
27|And if I decide I want to be friends with Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan,
27|isn't it my choice?
27|It is your choice.
27|Yup.
27|But as an apology for not telling you
27|about Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan,
27|you can have this ticket!
27|What's this?
27|This ticket entitles you to touch my breasts
27|whenever you want, for as long as you like.
27|It's yours.
27|Seriously?
27|Seriously.
27|But if you use it, I'll hate you forever.
27|Then it's useless!
27|Well, putting that aside,
27|don't be too mean to Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan.
27|It's fine.
27|Don't worry about it.
27|I realize they aren't just doing it for fun.
27|I know we talked about this before...
27|But still, they are kind of like you.
27|They resemble me?
27|Not on the outside, on the inside.
27|I guess I'm one to talk, though.
27|That's sure true.
27|Of course, your family and mine are different.
27|Oshino-san...
27|What's Oshino-san up to right now?
27|I don't know.
27|But he's watching over us from somewhere.
27|He'll probably just fix whatever's wrong with Karen-chan.
27|From what Shinobu said, the wreathe-fire bee
27|is a very low-level monster.
27|Shinobu-chan?
27|Wreathe-fire bee?
27|A wreathe-fire bee, huh?
27|But I'm glad to see you've made up with Shinobu-chan.
27|I'm not upset about it, but...
27|Well, the reason Oshino-san left was
27|because he thought he could leave Shinobu-chan to you, right?
27|Really, it would've made sense if you'd reconciled
27|just after the culture fair.
27|I guess that means it's taken a long time.
27|You could say I've been slacking on the job.
27|You haven't been slacking at all.
27|I know that very well.
27|You know everything, don't you?
27|I don't know everything.
27|I just know what I know.
27|The real problem in a fight comes after you've made up.
27|Keep that in mind.
27|I can go the rest of the way myself.
27|Take my bike.
27|I'll lend it to you.
27|You're sure?
27|I'll take it, I guess.
27|Okay, then thanks.
27|I'll give it back tomorrow.
27|Yeah.
27|Get this solved tonight.
27|You have to start studying again tomorrow.
27|It's good that you're being a brother,
27|but don't forget that you're a high school student, too!
27|You're making too big a deal out of this, Nii-chan.
27|That's why I didn't want to tell you.
27|People should keep their mouths shut.
27|It's just a fever.
27|Shut up.
27|You're sick, so shut up and do what I say.
27|Want to eat something?
27|Canned peaches?
27|No appetite.
27|I see.
27|I'm gonna let down your hair.
27|I want to take a bath.
27|This sweat feels awful.
27|Your hair.
27|Go ahead.
27|A bath isn't happening,
27|but I'll wipe down your body.
27|Thanks.
27|Not that I like it.
27|Right.
27|Then remove your clothes.
27|Hey, I said to remove your clothes.
27|Sorry, Nii-chan.
27|I'm tired...
27|Take my clothes off.
27|Wipe me down.
27|Put them back on.
27|Why, you...
27|Nii-chan saw me naked, and I am so freaking embarrassed. —Karen
27|Nii-chan saw me naked,
27|and I am so freaking embarrassed.
27|Why is it a haiku?
27|Because I'm embarrassed!
27|You dance around half naked when you get out of the bath.
27|I don't want to hear it.
27|I'm not dancing!
27|That's aerobics!
27|I'll wipe down your back.
27|Turn over.
27|Too lazy.
27|Turn me over.
27|Damn it...
27|I screwed this up.
27|I know strength is more important
27|than being right. I didn't need you to tell me.
27|But you can't get strong all of a sudden.
27|However,
27|that doesn't mean you can just ignore all the bad stuff you see
27|until you are strong.
27|The blood of justice flows through me,
27|and it tells me to punish evil.
27|You just like punching people.
27|That's what I think.
27|I'm sure it all looks like a game to you.
27|But Kaiki...
27|Kaiki Deishuu...
27|Tsukihi-chan already told you
27|why he was spreading those weird charms and curses
27|around the middle schools, right?
27|That's right... It was for money.
27|He spread hatred...
27|Fear...
27|And then, he took advantage of it,
27|to take money without actually doing anything.
27|And when I asked him if he weren't ashamed,
27|here is what he said.
27|Without a trace of shame, he said,
27|"Children are easier to fool."
27|Easier to fool...
27|Tsukihi-chan's friend... Sengoku, was it?
27|She didn't really want to talk about it,
27|but whatever happened, didn't you save her?
27|But she was one of the lucky ones.
27|Some kids went to Kaiki for help, not knowing he was the source of the rumors.
27|And when they tried to get the money,
27|he demanded they be arrested for shoplifting.
27|Could you have let that happen?
27|Could you have looked them in the eye and said,
27|"I'm not strong yet, so I won't do anything"?
27|He told me money was everything.
27|I didn't think anyone like that existed outside of manga.
27|I mean, money is important.
27|But aren't there other things that matter, too?
27|Love
27|Like love!
27|Our opinions overlapped.
27|Money isn't everything.
27|It's just most everything!
27|Okay, maybe not.
27|Nii-chan, Tsukihi-chan and I are serious about this.
27|We won't stop here.
27|If this happens again, we'll do the same thing.
27|This time, I may have lost the outcome.
27|But I didn't lose mentally.
27|And next time, I'll win.
27|I'll keep it up until I win.
27|I'll try, even if I don't win.
27|The outcome isn't all that's important. Right, Nii-chan?
27|Lose the match, but win the game, huh?
27|That's not something I'd expect to hear from a martial artist.
27|You can lose the match and the game,
27|but if you don't lose to yourself, it isn't a loss.
27|That's my way.
27|But as long as you stay like that,
27|those around you will suffer.
27|That's why you'll never grow up.
27|I'm already grown up.
27|Look at these boobs!
27|Not even half Hanekawa's size.
27|What of it?
27|Tsubasa-san is that big?
27|She's the real thing.
27|I think you know that.
27|Honestly,
27|I'd prefer if you didn't hang out with Hanekawa.
27|But I guess this is a good chance.
27|From now on, you should start learning from her.
27|Don't move.
27|It's hard to wipe you down.
27|It's fine now. I feel much better.
27|We're almost done. Don't stop now.
27|I don't want to get you sick.
27|Get me sick?
27|Wait a second.
27|Black Scene
27|Shinobu.
27|What?
27|It's almost time for bed.
27|Then, one thing before bed...
27|Is there any way to transfer her illness to me?
27|It's more of a supernatural poison than an illness.
27|And it was given to her deliberately.
27|So wouldn't it be possible for her to give it to me?
27|So you're saying you'll take her illness?
27|There is a way.
27|But honestly, I can't recommend it.
27|Or it would be more accurate to say
27|I certainly wouldn't prefer it.
27|I understand there's a risk.
27|I don't know if "risk" is the right word.
27|Well, I suppose it's an urban legend.
27|I think the kid used totally different words to describe it.
27|What?
27|That's pretty vague. And not like you at all.
27|Well, I don't know...
27|Whether it's something that would be allowed, I couldn't say.
27|I don't know what you're talking about,
27|but of course it would.
27|If there's any way to alleviate her suffering,
27|we should take it.
27|Very true.
27|Do what you will.
27|Nii-chan,
27|I don't know if you went to the bathroom or what,
27|but you should have at least dressed me first.
27|Karen-chan.
27|I'm going to kiss you now.
28|I'll just tell you how it ended up.
28|I wasn't able to take all the poison
28|from the wreathe-fire bee.
28|Stay with Karen, and don't cause any trouble today. —Koyomi
28|But even so, Karen's fever went down a little.
28|Black Scene
28|Hey, Hachikuji.
28|U-Um...
28|Hachikuji?
28|Is that you, Araragi-san?
28|Come on, screw up my name!
28|Araragi-san, if you're greeting me like a normal person,
28|that means you've gotten boring.
28|Did something happen?
28|Harsh!
28|Hey, you didn't like it, anyway!
28|That was just me acting, so you'd do it more.
28|You didn't really think "no" means "no", did you?
28|Jeez.
28|Don't push. Danger.
28|You ruined the opportunity I gave you!
28|Your "acting" is harsh!
28|You screwed it up right at the start.
28|Now the whole joke's wasted.
28|It's really that bad?!
28|Hey, Hachikuji.
28|Wait...
28|I don't know you.
28|My friend Araragi-san is dead.
28|Remove the sexual harassment from Araragi-san,
28|and there's nothing left but a flea.
28|No part of me was a flea to begin with!
28|Sexual Harassment Flea
28|I don't even want to see your face.
28|Disappear.
28|Don't say that!
28|Senjougahara's said that to me a hundred times,
28|but when you say it, I really do want to disappear.
28|So don't say that...
28|Huh?
28|I told you to disappear. Why are you still here?
28|You can't even do that?
28|Danger Ahead!
28|I want to restart from a save point!
28|So what happened?
28|You seem pretty serious, compared to yesterday.
28|Serious, huh?
28|Yeah, maybe.
28|A lot of stuff's happened.
28|Well, I won't ask for details.
28|But, Araragi-san,
28|you're looking disturbingly pale...
28|Am I?
28|You don't seem well.
28|I took half of Karen's illness, but that shouldn't result in any physical effects.
28|Wait, maybe Hachikuji can tell?
28|It was something called a wreathe-fire bee.
28|It's a totally different type
28|than your snail, I think.
28|But it's a problem anyway.
28|I see.
28|That is a problem...
28|But I'm sure you'll be fine, Araragi-san.
28|You always have been, right?
28|I hope so...
28|A lot of stuff is going wrong.
28|For one thing, my sisters are idiots.
28|More idiotic than you?
28|Don't call me an idiot!
28|What they're saying is right,
28|and I'd like to respect that...
28|But they're too rash.
28|What they want to do is right, but they aren't doing it right, right away.
28|That's how it feels.
28|Isn't that what you're always being told?
28|And if you weren't like that,
28|I wouldn't be able to take a nice walk around here.
28|So doesn't that mean that
28|they've saved a lot of people?
28|Still, I guess they're just kids.
28|They don't listen to a word anyone says.
28|I have to do this thing
28|while they're still sensible enough to stay home.
28|Sensible...
28|Hachikuji, when do you think you become an adult?
28|Not while you're saying things like that.
28|In Japan, you officially become an adult at twenty,
28|but it changes, depending on the era.
28|Some people say that once you start working, you're an adult.
28|But you can be an adult without working.
28|You can become an adult just by aging, huh?
28|I guess telling two girls in their second and third years
28|of middle school to grow up is asking too much.
28|Age-wise, they're kids.
28|That's the point!
28|It's natural for a middle schooler to be a kid.
28|But the fact that
28|they don't realize they're kids is the problem.
28|They may still be better than adults
28|who don't think they're adults.
28|There's nothing as difficult to deal with
28|as an adult who thinks they're a kid...
28|By the way, Hachikuji, how do you think of yourself?
28|The body of a child and the brains of an adult.
28|So, you're a detective?!
28|Then, Hachihachiji...
28|What were we talking about?
28|Araragi-san, you're missing a temple.
28|I see.
28|I didn't realize. Sorry.
28|Hachishichiji.
28|Are we losing temples each time you say my name?!
28|Hachirokuji.
28|I'm almost to Senjougahara's house.
28|We should split up here.
28|Oh, right.
28|You're right.
28|She doesn't like me.
28|Farewell, Araragi-san.
28|Be well.
28|You, too.
28|But at the time, I didn't know
28|what would happen to the cheerful young girl
28|named Hachikuji Mayoi.
28|Just kidding.
28|Honestly, I have no idea what will happen.
28|Episode 5: Karen Bee, Part 6
28|Tamikurasou
28|201
28|Um...
28|Gahara-san?
28|A question, Araragi-kun...
28|If, by some strange coincidence, a hundred sharp pencils
28|I was carrying embedded themselves in a third party,
28|would that be an accidental death?
28|No, it would be murder!
28|First-degree murder!
28|The following day's headlines would read, "Man Killed by Pencils!"
28|Then I'll sharpen more pencils on top of those headlines.
28|Calm down, Senjougahara!
28|You may think that's a good line, but it really isn't!
28|Take off your shoes and come in, Araragi-kun.
28|Don't worry. I won't tie you up again.
28|Thanks...
28|Well?
28|If I ask, will you tell me why you're
28|arming yourself so heavily?
28|I'm going to go and chat with Kaiki.
28|As you've refused my protection,
28|I've no choice but to go on the attack.
28|Kidnapping and protection are not the same thing!
28|One match can start a fire
28|Be careful with fire
28|By the way, I talked to Hanekawa afterwards.
28|What?
28|Did Hanekawa-sama...
28|I mean, Hanekawa-san say anything about me?
28|Did you just say "Hanekawa-sama"?
28|One match can start a fire
28|Be careful with fire
28|I-I did not.
28|There is no bullying occurring at my school.
28|Bullying Is A Crime
28|You're being bullied? You?!
28|I mean, given the way you act,
28|I can see you might attract a lot of Hanekawa's attention.
28|But don't say you're being bullied...
28|That's mean.
28|I'm not saying that.
28|I'm polishing her shoes every morning
28|because I enjoy doing so.
28|Why do you act like that toward her?
28|Anyway, you're going to see Kaiki, right?
28|But, Senjougahara, do you know where he is?
28|I have a business card from long ago,
28|one he gave me.
28|It's a miracle I never threw it away.
28|Ghost Buster Kaiki Deishuu
28|Senjougahara, I'm about to say
28|the worst thing in the world.
28|Ghost Buster Kaiki Deishuu
28|But if you fell for this, isn't it partially your own fault?
28|That's the trap.
28|You'd never think that anyone who'd give themselves
28|such a ridiculous title would actually be a con man.
28|Is that how it works?
28|So what, Senjougahara?
28|You called this number, and you spoke with him?
28|Yes.
28|He hadn't changed a bit.
28|As gloomy as ever.
28|Can I go with you?
28|If you're going to speak with Kaiki, I want to go...
28|I can still pretend I didn't hear that.
28|Unless you wish to die, take that back.
28|My sister was one of his victims.
28|Ghost Buster Kaiki Deishuu
28|He set some bizarre monster called a wreathe-fire bee on her.
28|She's suffering from a terrible fever.
28|I've taken half of it upon myself, to neutralize it,
28|but I don't know what could happen in the future.
28|You took half of it yourself?
28|Will you be okay?
28|My vampiric healing ability is keeping me safe.
28|It isn't perfect, but...
28|I see.
28|Then there's no turning back for you.
28|But I suppose with your sister involved,
28|that was never really a possibility.
28|That's not all.
28|You're involved, too.
28|Your trying to deal with Kaiki alone, for my sake, is insane.
28|Am I wrong?
28|It isn't only for your sake.
28|Kaiki is one of the things I need to settle for myself.
28|To the point where, had he not returned,
28|I'd have gone looking for him.
28|Why are you so obsessed?
28|One match can start a fire
28|Be careful with fire
28|Wasn't it a little thing?
28|That was me tsundere-ing.
28|Tsundere-ing?
28|Do you plan to seek revenge on all five of the con artists like that?
28|It's over.
28|Aren't there other things you should settle?
28|Of course not.
28|Like Oshino-san said, I won't pretend
28|to be their helpless victim.
28|I relied on them, and I was betrayed.
28|My personality isn't such that I still...
28|My personality...
28|My personality isn't the issue here.
28|I won't do that.
28|One match can start a fire
28|You have some personality problems, don't you?
28|But Kaiki is a different matter.
28|Why?
28|He's the one responsible for my mom and dad's divorce.
28|Naturally, I can't blame the entire thing on Kaiki,
28|and I don't intend to.
28|But he ruined my family.
28|I can't forgive that.
28|If I forgave it...
28|I wouldn't be myself anymore.
28|I think that
28|even without Kaiki, my mom and dad would have divorced.
28|I think my family would have been split up.
28|I think it's my fault that my mom left...
28|But, Araragi-kun,
28|does the fact that the result would have
28|been the same forgive the fact that he caused it?
28|Does the fact that it would have happened,
28|sooner or later, forgive the fact that he made it happen, out of malice?
28|Malice
28|Malice.
28|Malice is something I have a monopoly on.
28|I don't know about that.
28|Ghost Buster Kaiki Deishuu
28|Kaiki used the crab I met to ruin
28|my family, all for money.
28|Because it made no difference...
28|It's possible that you were a secondary concern for me,
28|that protecting you was simply an excuse.
28|And that, in the end, I simply hate Kaiki.
28|An excuse?
28|One match can start a fire
28|Be careful with fire
28|So I tsundere-ed.
28|Don't get the wrong idea.
28|I'm not doing this for your sake, Araragi-kun.
28|That is
28|probably not true.
28|The crab...
28|The crab that Senjougahara met.
28|Stop
28|Beast
28|Perversion and Sexual Desire
28|Praying
28|Flashback Flashback Flashback
28|This happened when the crab was possessing her.
28|In Surgery
28|She couldn't even hate Kaiki Deishuu when it happened.
28|M*m Broken
28|That was how the crab worked.
28|Hand Hand Hand
28|She should have gotten angry, like a child.
28|A child who'd lost her mom.
28|But then, there is
28|one thing I don't understand.
28|Kaiki is a con man and a fake, right?
28|But from what you said, it sounds like he saw your crab.
28|I don't know.
28|But a fake with more power than the real thing
28|is more dangerous than the real thing.
28|Of course, at the time,
28|I thought him just another sleazy con artist.
28|But thinking back,
28|he may have deliberately feigned incompetence
28|to draw more money from my father.
28|He's spending his time taking pocket change from middle schoolers now.
28|And he got my sister when she tried to stop him.
28|I see.
28|Your sister is a hero-man like you.
28|Stop calling me that!
28|The Fire Sisters of Tsuganoki 2nd Middle School.
28|I'd heard the rumors.
28|Come to think of it, you did hear about them.
28|Just so we're clear, Araragi-kun,
28|my impression is that
28|"right" is a concept that won't work on him.
28|And "right" is all you have,
28|which makes you strong against hypocrites,
28|but weak against someone who's really evil.
28|I told you I'm not like that...
28|However,
28|I won't sit back and let you become a criminal.
28|I've no intention of committing any crimes.
28|I'm just going to punish him...
28|In modern society the two are identical.
28|One match can start a fire
28|Be careful with fire
28|Senjougahara, you might not know this,
28|but I love you.
28|Even if you do become a criminal, and end up in jail,
28|I'd still visit you every day.
28|But I'd rather be with you all the time.
28|Sometimes, I don't know why I'm dating you.
28|But I love you so much, I don't need a reason.
28|If you're going, then let's go together.
28|You can protect me...
28|I'll protect you.
28|Oh, no.
28|So incredibly cool...
28|If I were a man,
28|I'd be so jealous of your manliness that I'd kill you.
28|Terrifying!
28|Terrifying
28|I'm glad I'm a woman
28|because I can love you...
28|I understand, Araragi-kun.
28|I'll do as you say.
28|Then you'll take me to Kaiki?
28|Yes.
28|But in exchange, I do have a request.
28|A request?
28|If you dislike the presumption implied by the word "request,"
28|then call it a condition.
28|A condition required before I'll take you to Kaiki.
28|What will you do?
28|I'll do it.
28|I'll do it gladly, no matter what it is or how many there are.
28|I have just one request, Araragi-kun.
28|By meeting with Kaiki, I intend to resolve things with myself.
28|Just like my master cut...
28|I mean, Hanekawa-san cut her hair.
28|That is a remarkable mistake to make.
28|My Master
28|And not anything I can pretend I didn't hear!
28|I am not being threatened.
28|You're being threatened? By Hanekawa?!
28|No matter where I am,
28|it's natural that I should kneel before Hanekawa-san.
28|No matter where you are?
28|Just as Hanekawa-san...
28|As Hanekawa-san cut her hair.
28|Just as doing that let her move forward,
28|I'm going to settle things with my past by meeting Kaiki.
28|I'm going to move forward.
28|So, what's your request?
28|What must I do, for you to take me with you?
28|I can't say yet.
28|It's something you can't tell me?
28|Once things are settled with Kaiki,
28|no matter what the outcome,
28|I'll tell you then.
28|Then there's no difference if you say it now.
28|If I said it now, it wouldn't be foreshadowing.
28|It's foreshadowing?!
28|That's right.
28|After you die, I'll have to spend
28|the rest of my life alone, regretting that I didn't say anything now.
28|It's foreshadowing my death?
28|That's right.
28|And in the climactic scene,
28|the telescope you gave me for
28|my birthday features as an important item.
28|There isn't a scene involving a telescope!
28|Just tell me what it is...
28|Screw the foreshadowing!
28|Then let's forget the whole thing.
28|Fine... I'll do it.
28|All right.
28|Then let's go.
28|Let's protect each other.
28|Room 201
28|I promised I'd meet him at 5:00 PM.
28|Right...
28|Then I'll be going back to my house.
28|Very well.
28|Then come back in the early evening.
28|Yeah.
28|Don't do anything on your own, okay?
28|Of course not.
28|Have I ever lied?
28|Don't worry.
28|This time, it's to get you to hear my request.
28|I might lie, but I'll keep my promise.
28|All right...
28|Well, then that's okay.
28|Yes.
28|This is a trade.
28|And...
28|Even I'm starting to get a little tired.
28|You've been up all night,
28|even if you were unconscious for a while.
28|Kaiki isn't someone you can deal with on no sleep.
28|Well, I think I deal with no sleep better than most.
28|As a former vampire.
28|But rest up anyway.
28|You might not be able to sleep tonight.
28|Onii-chan?
28|Oh, you're up?
28|Good morning.
28|Karen-chan is gone!
28|When I got up...
28|She wasn't there...
28|And she can't be fully healed yet!
28|Calm down, Tsukihi-chan!
28|Her shoes are gone,
28|and it looks like she changed her clothes...
28|Calm down.
28|Do you have any idea where she'd go?
28|Anywhere she'd be likely to go?
28|None...
28|I think she'd go to that Kaiki guy's place.
28|But I don't know where he is...
28|Does that mean Karen-chan does?
28|She shouldn't.
28|She let him go once.
28|I'll look for her.
28|You wait at home.
28|But I want to go, too.
28|If you find her, there's a risk she'll persuade you to go with her.
28|You really don't trust me, do you?
28|I don't.
28|But I do worry.
28|But more than that, I'm mad!
28|Think.
28|If I were Karen, what would I do?
28|First, I'd want to get away from the house.
28|No Cars Please
28|Because if I found her, I'd take her back.
28|That much is certain.
28|The problem is, what then?
28|What then? What then? What then?
28|Black Scene
28|Be quiet...
28|You're being too loud for me to sleep.
28|When you panic,
28|that panic is transmitted directly to me.
28|Shinobu,
28|do you know what's going on?
28|Basically.
28|Your sister's almost as reckless as you are...
28|Come to think of it,
28|you once searched for me when I was lost.
28|I remember those days.
28|Can I ask if you're going to help me?
28|Ha ha.
28|Unfortunately,
28|I'm not in a position to refuse any request you make.
28|The question of which of us is the master
28|is a complicated one,
28|but you're certainly the stronger.
28|I've told you a bunch of times that
28|the bonds of a vampire are bonds of the soul, right?
28|Thus,
28|for any order you give me,
28|no matter how much I may want to refuse, I cannot.
28|It isn't an order.
28|I'm not in a position to order you.
28|Then I won't do it, idiot.
28|What you just saw
28|was me saying I'd help you, but I'd rather not say so myself.
28|So please allow me to save face by calling it an order.
28|Why couldn't you tell?
28|My showing up right now, when I should clearly
28|be sleeping was obviously so that I could help you.
28|You're a tsundere, too.
28|Then it's an order.
28|Get off your ass, and find out where Karen-chan is, already!
28|Oh, no... Oh, no.
28|What cruel fate forces me to obey the orders
28|of a lesser being like this human?
28|But I cannot disobey an order...
28|You can't do anything without me around.
28|You're so cute.
28|Ha ha.
28|Your sister's blood is structurally similar to yours.
28|So I can tell where she is by the smell.
28|She doesn't seem to have gone very far...
29|Hey, kiss-freak...
29|We're going home.
29|Shut up.
29|Go home by yourself.
29|Don't try and stop me.
29|I told you...
29|How mad he made me.
29|And I told you to leave the rest to me.
29|I...
29|I never said I would.
29|Don't push yourself...
29|You should rest right now.
29|I'm not going to talk about this.
29|You won't listen to what I have to say anyway.
29|I'll listen later.
29|I'll sit beside you, peeling apples,
29|while you rest.
29|Come to think of it,
29|it's been a long time since I've had a real, serious
29|fight with you!
29|Episode 7: Karen Bee, Part 7
29|Don't be stupid.
29|I've never been serious against my little sister.
29|This isn't the dojo.
29|And you're not in great shape,
29|Stung by Supernatural Bee
29|right?
29|Great shape?
29|You've got that right.
29|My head's all stuffed up, and my whole body is hot.
29|It feels like my clothes are about to catch fire.
29|My muscles ache, and I can barely walk.
29|And maybe there isn't enough moisture
29|in my eyes, 'cause you look all blurry.
29|The next time I blink, I might never open my eyes again.
29|So I'm in the best shape of my life!
29|Pretty cool...
29|If you weren't my sister, I'd fall in love with you.
29|If you weren't my brother, I might be able to hold back!
29|Thanks, Nii-chan...
29|That woke me up!
29|There are twenty minutes till the next bus comes.
29|Nii-chan, should I call you an ambulance?
29|Hell, no.
29|The one who'll be taking the ambulance...
29|is you!
29|No way.
29|How can he stand?
29|That could've killed him.
29|I was told never to use it outside the dojo...
29|Then I think it's time they kicked you out!
29|Don't try and stop me!
29|By the way, Nii-chan...
29|When Your Body Feels Hot
29|When you say, "Your body feels hot,"
29|don't you think it seems kinda naughty?
29|I don't...
29|Because
29|"hot" is the first three letters of "hotel"!
29|Are you my junior?!
29|Naughtiness in the Athletic Storeroom A beast of lust arrives!
29|Talk to us about anything
29|Your junior? Who's that?
29|The biggest pervert I know!
29|Kanbaru Suruga
29|Recreation
29|Hey, master...
29|Recreation
29|Did I not tell you?
29|Just as your fears are transmitted to me directly,
29|I feel your pain, as well.
29|Put up with it for a little longer.
29|Recreation
29|If you order me to, I will act.
29|Here's your order: do nothing.
29|Recreation
29|You ask the hardest things...
29|I'll pat your head later.
29|Recreation
29|That isn't enough.
29|I request a ritual one level higher.
29|I didn't know there was one.
29|Recreation
29|Out of curiosity, what is it?
29|Don't pat my head...
29|Rub my breasts.
29|Recreation
29|Why didn't you say that to me
29|when you were still an adult?!
29|Punch
29|Give it up, already.
29|It hurts my fists when I punch you...
29|Forget that.
29|It hurts me when you punch me.
29|You can't beat me, Nii-chan.
29|You can't beat me, Karen-chan.
29|This is your chance to surrender, Nii-chan!
29|It's way too late for that line.
29|My fists hurt, so I'm going to stop punching you.
29|Not bad, Nii-chan!
29|Hey!
29|You get it now, right?
29|You can't beat me, Nii-chan!
29|You're the one who needs to get it...
29|You can't beat me, Karen-chan!
29|The good guy always wins, right?
29|Doesn't that mean that whoever wins is right, Nii-chan?
29|So if I beat you, I can go?
29|That way of thinking is dangerous.
29|It's about as far from justice as you can get.
29|What are you talking about?
29|You always say that, don't you?
29|Like a big arrogant jerk.
29|What do I say?
29|About Tsukihi-chan and me...
29|We're right, but we aren't strong.
29|And the good guys always win, so you can't lose.
29|Fakes
29|You always talk like you're so much better than we are!
29|So I tried to make it so I wouldn't lose...
29|Oh, that?
29|That's correct.
29|You're right.
29|But you aren't strong.
29|I am strong...
29|Stronger than you, if nothing else.
29|Physically strong means nothing.
29|To be the real thing,
29|you need a strong will.
29|When you say you can't forgive Kaiki, where is your will?
29|You two are always trying to help others.
29|You're always doing it for someone else.
29|There's no will of your own there.
29|No!
29|We're doing what we think is right.
29|Everyone else is just the reason.
29|Don't make me laugh!
29|How can someone who seeks
29|a reason from another person be right?
29|While you're forcing that reason
29|on someone else, how can you take responsibility?
29|You're not good, and you're not heroes.
29|You're just kids playing a game!
29|Fakes
29|Fakes.
29|You never go after evil people, just villains.
29|Am I wrong?
29|You are!
29|You don't know anything, so shut up.
29|Tsubasa-san would understand...
29|She knows everything!
29|She doesn't know everything.
29|All she knows
29|is what she knows.
29|If you can't give up the idea of self-sacrifice and be content with self-satisfaction,
29|you need to shut up.
29|It gives me a headache to hear you talk.
29|What's wrong with doing something for someone else?
29|What's wrong with self-sacrifice?
29|Even if... Even if we're fakes, what's wrong with that?
29|Has it ever caused any trouble for you?!
29|For a long time now.
29|But...
29|I never said it was wrong.
29|If you're prepared to live with a sense of inferiority for the rest of your life,
29|then even if you're a fake, isn't that the same as being real?
29|Just so we're clear, I hate you two.
29|But I'm always proud of you.
29|Nii-chan.
29|You said he made you mad, right?
29|I heard you...
29|However, I'm much madder...
29|He hurt something I'm proud of, and he'll pay.
29|Leave the rest to me!
29|I'm mad, but I also feel pathetic.
29|Making you clean up after my mess...
29|You can't even clean up your own sweat. Don't worry about it.
29|Cleaning up after their
29|little sister is an honor for a big brother.
29|This time, I'll show you being cool.
29|Make sure you don't fall in love.
29|It'd be incestuous...
29|I'm already in love, Nii-chan.
29|You take care of the rest.
29|Black Scene
29|7/30 Sunday
29|After that, I carried Karen home on my back. I don't think she'll be running off again, but just in case, I wrote "Any man will do" on her face with permanent marker, so she can't leave. (While I was at it, I wrote "Wearing a bra is a pain, so I'm not" on Tsukihi's. She shares responsibility, too.) Then I went to meet up with Senjougahara again. Then...
29|Aren't you the one I met in front of the Gaen child's house?
29|Fine-ground and Deep-roasted
29|You're here about your sister?
29|Naughty Ferris Wheel
29|A very manly child, then. Rare these days.
29|Your charm is gone, Senjougahara.
29|You've become a normal girl.
29|What?
29|I never wanted to see you again.
29|Actually, that's a lie.
29|I never wanted to see you in the first place.
29|But I can say this now...
29|I've been wanting to see you, Kaiki-san.
29|I didn't want to see you,
29|now that you're just a normal girl.
29|Naughty Ferris Wheel
29|The last time we met, you shone like darkness.
29|No, better to say you'd attained a level of enlightenment.
29|Someone well worth deceiving...
29|Stop. Let's talk.
29|I've come to talk.
29|So did you, right?
29|Am I wrong?
29|Very well. I get it...
29|I'll stop cheating the middle schoolers.
29|And I won't spread the charms anymore.
29|And that lively little girl,
29|your sister... Don't worry about her, Araragi.
29|It's called instant hypnosis.
29|She'll recover her health within the next three days.
29|And, Senjougahara...
29|I'll officially apologize for what happened with your mother.
29|And I'll do my best to return the money
29|taken from your father.
29|That's quite gracious of you...
29|Did you really think I'd believe it?
29|You don't seem repentant at all.
29|Not the slightest bit.
29|Don't I?
29|Come to think of it, I didn't actually apologize.
29|Or beg for my life.
29|Sorry, very sorry, guys.
29|I'm very repentant.
29|Very sorry.
29|I'm supposed to believe that half-hearted apology?
29|Every word you say is a lie.
29|Perhaps.
29|I'd prefer if you didn't upset me.
29|I'm doing everything I can to hold myself back right now.
29|Refraining from killing you is very difficult.
29|So it seems.
29|And it's in that respect that you've become normal.
29|The old you would never have held back.
29|I won't ask you to return the money.
29|That won't bring my family back.
29|You won't?
29|That's great.
29|I go through money fast.
29|I barely have any on me.

29|I'd have needed to think up a new con.

29|Broken
29|Leave this city.
29|Now.
29|Very well.
29|What's wrong, Araragi?
29|Why do you look at me with those eyes?
29|I hurt your sister.
29|Shouldn't I see more hatred in them?
29|She got what was coming to her.
29|It's her fault for getting involved with someone like you.
29|That's not true.
29|Her mistake was coming to see me alone.
29|If she wanted to get me, she should have
29|come with greater numbers, just as you have.
29|In most other respects, she was right.
29|Or, Araragi, did you decide on your own that she is a fool,
29|thereby denying her?
29|I think she's right. Just...
29|She isn't strong?
29|True, she isn't.
29|But denying her kindness is a mistake.
29|And...
29|And without girls like that around,
29|I'd be out of business as a con man.
29|So why is a con man like that
29|doing what I want?
29|It would be easy to talk me into doing whatever you wished.
29|Like before.
29|Senjougahara,
29|you have the wrong idea about me.
29|No, you have the right idea. You merely overestimate me.
29|The person you view as your enemy
29|is just a pathetic, middle-aged man.
29|Even as a con man, he's a minor and shabby one.
29|Or did I seem to you like some sort of monster?
29|Of course not.
29|You're just...
29|...a fake.
29|Yes, that's right.
29|I'm a fake.
29|I'm no one special.
29|Nor are you.
29|There's nothing dramatic about me
29|or about you.
29|Araragi, what about you?
29|I'd like to ask you a question.
29|Naughty Ferris Wheel
29|Is your life dramatic?
29|Tragic
29|Tragic?
29|Comedic
29|Musical?
29|Musical
29|I feel an unpleasant presence from your shadow.
29|And it appears
29|you've taken half of your sister's pain onto yourself.
29|Madness...
29|To do something so risky for no money.
29|Which are you?
29|Which am I?
29|Do you know about the supernatural?
29|That's a less interesting question than I expected...
29|You're ruining my fun, Araragi.
29|For example, do you believe in ghosts?
29|You understand the mind of someone
29|who doesn't believe in ghosts,
29|but is still scared of them, right?
29|I'm something similar.
29|So let me answer your question this way...
29|I know nothing about the supernatural.
29|But I know those who do know.
29|That is all.
29|More precisely, I simply know those who think they know.
29|The wreathe-fire bee.
29|Ever heard of the wreathe-fire bee?
29|A monster from around the 15th century or something, wasn't it?
29|When a strange plague was explained
29|as the work of a supernatural monster.
29|Correct.
29|However, wrong.
29|The wreathe-fire bee is a monster recorded in Chapter 15
29|Wreathe-Fire Bee
29|18th-Century Work
29|of the 18th-century work,
29|Illustrated Codex of Eastern Disturbances, Chapter 15
29|The Illustrated Codex of Eastern Disturbances.
29|However, the truth of the matter
29|is that there was no such plague during the Muromachi era.
29|Falsified History Bee
29|Falsified history.
29|Those who came after the author
29|foolishly believed the tale he'd written.
29|My sister...
29|My sister who was stung by the wreathe-fire bee...
29|Any Man Will Do.
29|Wearing a bra is a pain, so I'm not
29|Is it true that she'll recover, even if we do nothing?
29|Of course.
29|There are no monsters.
29|Victim
29|And thus, no victims.
29|Monster
29|You think that they exist,
29|so you feel like they're there.
29|Let me be clear...
29|Don't involve me in your delusions.
29|It's a nuisance.
29|He's a fake.
29|Just like Senjougahara said
29|and he said,
29|he's decided to live his entire life with a sense of inferiority.
29|A proud fake.
29|And you've taken half of it upon yourself.
29|It may not even take three days.
29|I don't know how you did it, but that's impressive.
29|But that means, Araragi,
29|Naughty Ferris Wheel
29|that you and I will never accept one another.
29|It's far worse than water and oil.
29|We're fire and oil.
29|Who's fire and who's oil?
29|I don't know.
29|Since neither of us really seems like fire,
29|why not rubidium and water instead?
29|And I'm the rubidium.
29|So I'm water?
29|Then the fire is Karen and Tsukihi.
29|Fire and fire...
29|Together, they become an inferno,
29|the Fire Sisters.
29|Your phone.
29|Give me your phone.
29|That was horrible of you.
29|Now I won't be able to help those poor middle schoolers...
29|I wouldn't know how to reach them.
29|I'm not asking you to help kids I don't even know.
29|Araragi-kun, I'm about to say the most horrible thing in the world.
29|It's their fault for being tricked.
29|I'm not a hero or a good guy.
29|I'm just an enemy of evil.
29|You can't do anything for the victims, anyway.
29|Even if you tried,
29|you'd only end up stealing more from them.
29|I'm sure I would.
29|I'm a con man.
29|The whole atonement thing was a lie, as well.
29|You probably don't want to understand this,
29|but for me, making money isn't a matter of profit and loss.
29|That's the part of you...
29|The "part of me" you what?
29|No answer?
29|You really have grown up to be boring...
29|Dramatic or not, you used to be wonderful.
29|And now you're just boring.
29|Heavier and fatter, though.
29|Shut up.
29|I don't care what you say about the old me.
29|But don't insult me as I am now.
29|Araragi-kun says he loves me.
29|He loves me as I am now.
29|Therefore, I like me as I am, too.
29|So I cannot ignore anything you say that would damage me.
29|What?
29|So you two are like that.
29|I see... I see.
29|So that's it...
29|Then I've nothing more to say.
29|I don't wish to interfere with a budding relationship.
29|If you're not going to ask for it, I won't attempt to atone.
29|I don't want to do anything that won't get me any money.
29|I'll leave town.
29|I'll be gone tomorrow.
29|That's good enough, isn't it, Senjougahara?
29|Oh, yes... Senjougahara.
29|Let me tell you something.
29|I don't want to hear it.
29|The man who once tried to rape you...
29|He was hit by a car and died.
29|In a place that had nothing to do with you,
29|in a way that had nothing to do with you.
29|And with no drama at all.
29|That's all there is to the past that
29|you spend so much time worrying about.
29|There's nothing even worth settling.
29|The lesson for you here is not to expect anything dramatic from life.
29|That's another lie, of course.
29|The man who'd forgotten about me until this morning
29|wouldn't know a thing about the man who tried to rape me.
29|Senjougahara, try to see past the surface of things.
29|It's possible that the fact that I'd forgotten
29|about you was a lie, right?
29|A lie...
29|That's a lie.
29|Black Scene
29|Does it matter if it's a lie?
29|There's no such thing as truth in this world.
29|Don't worry.
29|The fact that you were once in love with me
29|doesn't count as cheating.
29|It isn't fair to me if you hate me, in an attempt
29|at loyalty to your current lover.
29|I'll say it again.
29|The past is merely the past.
29|There's no value in overcoming it or catching up to it.
29|A woman like you shouldn't be bound by such stupid emotions.
29|Just be happy with the man you have.
29|Farewell.
29|You fell in love with him?
29|What was that?
29|Araragi-kun, did you just attempt
29|to confirm the virginity of the girl you're dating?
29|Of course not.
29|That would never happen.
29|He's simply mistaken.
29|What an insult.
29|Disgusting...
29|But at that time,
29|anyone who attempted to save me would have seemed a prince,
29|no matter what kind of person they were.
29|I won't deny that I did feel somewhat positively toward that con man.
29|He was still the first...
29|I've discussed this before, so I won't dwell on it.
29|If anyone other than you had saved me,
29|it's possible I would've fallen in love with them, too.
29|When I think about that, it infuriates me.
29|I'm so glad you were the one who did...
29|Oshino would say that you just got saved by yourself.
29|Possibly.
29|Let's go home.
29|It's getting late.
29|Oh, right, Senjougahara...
29|Before we leave, tell me that request you had.
29|What are you going to make me do?
29|Nothing special.
29|I didn't need that con man to tell me.
29|It's possible that my past isn't worth settling things with.
29|But I just did.
29|That's what I think.
29|Settled, huh?
29|Compliment me.
29|That's your request?
29|No.
29|A compliment from someone like you means
29|absolutely nothing to me.
29|But you seem to have forgotten to fulfill your obvious duty.
29|I simply reminded you.
29|Really, are you made of iron or something?
29|Iron?
29|Of course not.
29|I am a soft, cute girl.
29|After everything that scum said to me, I am terribly hurt.
29|I can barely stand...
29|Liar.
29|Are you a con artist, too?
29|It's true.
29|So...
29|Be gentle to me tonight.
29|Black Scene
29|The next day,
29|without even waiting for the three days Kaiki had stated,
29|Karen had recovered.
29|After that, I gave a general explanation to Karen and Tsukihi.
29|That Kaiki was gone from the city.
29|And thus, there would be no more victims.
29|Nii-chan, we'll be gone for a bit.
29|Onii-chan, we'll be gone for a while.
29|Where are you two yuri sisters going?
29|Even with the con man gone,
29|that doesn't mean the charms will just disappear.
29|And the damage they did
29|to people's relationships won't heal itself.
29|The fact that there are no more victims
29|doesn't help the victims already there.
29|So we want to start cleaning up the mess.
29|Don't let your game get out of hand.
29|It's not a game, Nii-chan!
29|We're not good guys.
29|We're goodness itself, Onii-chan.
29|Bye!
29|My prides.
29|My little sisters I'm so proud of.
29|Fakes...
29|But because of that, closer than anything to the real thing.
29|The Fire Sisters ran out of the house
29|like a lit firecracker.
30|Let's end our story by revealing
30|the true identity of Araragi Tsukihi.
30|You're always like that, Onii-chan.
30|You treat Karen-chan and me like kids.
30|The story of my bratty and annoying
30|littler little sister will bring these episodes
30|of my beloved companions and me to a close.
30|How come you don't know?
30|I'm platinum mad!
30|Araragi Tsukihi.
30|One of the Fire Sisters.
30|The younger little sister.
30|The littler little sister.
30|Second year, in middle school.
30|Born in April.
30|Age 14.
30|Blood type B.
30|A hysteric.
30|I don't want to hear that from you.
30|Sly.
30|You can be mad at Karen-chan,
30|but please don't get mad at me.
30|Prone to heights of emotion.
30|Huh?
30|Onii-chan, where's that girl?
30|And immortal, too.
30|This is the story of just another fake.
30|Episode 8: Tsukihi Phoenix, Part 1
30|August 14th Monday Morning
30|Sole
30|Nii-chan, is there anything you want me to do?
30|No.
30|There must be something, right?
30|Come on, Nii-chan...
30|I want to be useful to you.
30|I may not look it, but I'm a very helpful little sister...
30|A dedicated little sister...
30|A little sister ready to serve you!
30|Nothing...
30|There's nothing!
30|There's nothing I would want my sister to do this early in the morning!
30|There's nothing I want you to do for me,
30|and there's nothing you can do...
30|As you can see, I'm trying to concentrate on studying.
30|English Drills
30|I don't have time to play with a lower life form like you,
30|you single-celled organism!
30|If you're bored, go run through the fields.
30|You don't have to come back...
30|Um...
30|Araragi Karen, my sister, is wearing a skirt.
30|Who is this pretty girl?
30|Karen-chan!
30|If someone's bullying you, tell me!
30|Why didn't you talk to me
30|before this terrible thing happened?
30|No, nobody's bullying me.
30|If anyone is, it's you, Nii-chan.
30|I can laugh about this now.
30|But some of your thoughtless words
30|almost drove me to suicide when I was in elementary school.
30|That was the start of my attempts to be a hero.
30|The hatred for evil in my heart is something you created.
30|But... But, Karen-chan...
30|If no one's threatening you,
30|there's no way you would dress like this!
30|Don't worry, Karen-chan.
30|I'll do something.
30|Leave it all to your big brother.
30|Let's start by giving me
30|the addresses and cell phone numbers of whoever is bullying you.
30|And then the names of any teachers who let them get away with it!
30|I'll make them all pay!
30|Sometimes, Nii-chan, you're hotter than fire.
30|I'm in love.
30|Oh, I get it... It's cosplay.
30|Don't call a girl wearing a skirt "cosplay"!
30|Even I
30|get a little hurt.
30|That's the kind of stuff that
30|made me want to kill myself in middle school.
30|So, there was a time when even you were delicate, huh?
30|If it isn't cosplay, and you aren't being bullied, what is it?
30|Well, I was wondering if it was cute...
30|Then I don't know what to say...
30|It's cute, isn't it?
30|S-Sure is cute...
30|K-Karen-chan...
30|Thank you!
30|I'm so happy you complimented me, Nii-chan!
30|I'm so happy. So happy... Yay!
30|I just feel so relaxed when I'm hanging on to Nii-chan...
30|It just feels so good, giving you a big hug like this!
30|This must be how a Tempur-Pedic pillow feels!
30|Stop it! It feels creepy.
30|Creepy! Creepy! Creepy!
30|I'm sorry.
30|It really, really, really feels creepy.
30|Get away from me!
30|What is this?
30|What did I do to you?
30|Karen-chan, what is the meaning of all this?
30|I don't know how to answer that...
30|I know. From now on, I've decided
30|to be a good little sister, who loves her brother and would never disobey him.
30|I don't want that!
30|And I think that character would overlap with Kanbaru!
30|Kanbaru.
30|Um... Karen-chan.
30|Kanbaru is my junior by one year.
30|Yes...
30|Kanbaru Suruga.
30|Huh?
30|I didn't say her full name yet, did I?
30|Karen-chan.
30|Nii-chan, I have a request!
30|Would you please introduce
30|your little sister to Kanbaru-sensei?
30|Well, come to think of it,
30|martial arts is a type of sport, isn't it?
30|I guess it makes perfect sense that you'd know
30|a local star and national-level player like Kanbaru.
30|Please, Nii-chan...
30|Nay, Onii-sama.
30|Don't say "nay."
30|Aye, sir.
30|That's a good answer, but...
30|I'm so honored that you'd step on me...
30|And I'm seriously sick of seeing you bow.
30|Don't bow every time something happens.
30|Just so you know,
30|in modern society, bowing is a form of violence!
30|Got it! Then I'll lick your feet.
30|I'll start with the big toe, and work my way down!
30|That's why I'm telling you to stop!
30|Fine... Then I'll give you my virginity.
30|I'll give you my virginity, Nii-chan!
30|Black Scene
30|I don't want my little sister's virginity!
30|I guess I should ask about this.
30|Karen-chan, you don't act like this outside, do you?
30|With your friends, or classmates,
30|or teachers at school?
30|Of course not.
30|Everyone looks up to me.
30|Anyway, I'm amazed Tsukihi-chan loaned you those clothes.
30|You're gonna stretch the fabric if you wear them.
30|That's why I took them quietly...
30|She's gonna get mad at you later.
30|She's scarier than you are.
30|I hate to say this after you complimented me,
30|but skirts don't seem to match my skin.
30|But this miniskirt works great for kicking.
30|By the way, Karen-chan,
30|how did you learn I was friends with Kanbaru?
30|Oh, the unofficial Kanbaru-sensei fan club, Kanbaru Tool,
30|sent me a newsletter with lots of pictures of you in it.
30|Kanbaru Tool This is the unofficial fan club, made by your host, a huge Kanbaru Suruga fan. It is unofficial. There are no dues. It's a place for comrades who secretly love Kanbaru Suruga to gather. !!No trolling!!
30|She didn't know you guys took those pictures, did she?!
30|And then my own investigations revealed
30|that she looks up to you like a teacher.
30|Well, that's true, I guess.
30|I think this must be some kind of karma, Nii-chan.
30|Would you please introduce me to Kanbaru-sensei?
30|Karma, huh?
30|It may sound odd to say this,
30|but I think Kanbaru-sensei and I would get along!
30|But I have no intention of introducing my sister to Kanbaru.
30|There's a reason I can't.
30|It's because I know her sexual proclivities,
30|of which most people are unaware.
30|Karen-chan.
30|What is it, Nii-chan?
30|Give it up.
30|Now, let's talk, Nii-chan.
30|You're telling me you can't do a favor for your wonderful little sister?
30|Then I have my own idea.
30|I-If bowing doesn't get you what you want, you immediately resort to violence?
30|No way...
30|Seriously impossible!
30|Impossible?!
30|Then what am I supposed to do, Nii-chan?
30|Is there some way to get through to you, besides talking?
30|Then we need to have a game...
30|If we fight, we have a game.
30|That's our rule.
30|And just so we're clear, it won't be fair.
30|This is just your request. There's nothing in this for me.
30|Karen-chan, this game won't be fair.
30|I'll have a huge advantage.
30|Okay, that works.
30|I guess you understand.
30|Sure, you can choose whatever rules you like.
30|To meet Kanbaru-sensei,
30|I'll pass any test!
30|Wait a second.
30|I'll get the tools ready.
30|Nii-chan, that was fast.
30|Closed
30|Nii-chan?
30|That's my toothbrush you're holding, isn't it?
30|Y-You're not...
30|Nii-chan?
30|You're going to stick that toothbrush
30|up my butt?!
30|That's my brother...
30|Terrifying!
30|No, your brother isn't going to think up anything that terrifying.
30|Karen-chan,
30|a toothbrush is for brushing teeth.
30|Nii-chan,
30|you may be right, and a toothbrush may be for brushing teeth.
30|But what of it?
30|You aren't going to tell me to brush my teeth here, are you?
30|No.
30|No, I'm not.
30|I won't have you brush them.
30|I'm going to brush them.
30|And I'm not going to brush my teeth.
30|I'm going to brush your teeth.
30|Um, I don't understand.
30|You're going to brush my teeth?
30|How is that a game?
30|You and Tsukihi-chan get your hair cut at a beauty parlor, right?
30|But I don't really like those.
30|I get nervous when someone I don't know
30|touches my head.
30|Yeah, I only want the stylists I know cutting mine.
30|Psychologically, you have to be fairly close
30|to someone before you'd allow them to touch your hair.
30|I've heard that some girls are more against
30|having their hair touched than their bodies
30|What of it?
30|It's called "touching."
30|The most obvious example is hair-cutting.
30|Another example is tooth-brushing.
30|A moment ago, you didn't think it was a big deal.
30|But usually, having someone else brush your teeth is out of the question.
30|Normally, you can do it yourself, and normally, you do.
30|In other words, Karen-chan,
30|having someone else brush your teeth
30|generates major psychological resistance.
30|If you can withstand
30|that psychological resistance for five minutes, you win.
30|If you do, I'll introduce you to Kanbaru.
30|If you cry uncle before the five minutes are up, I win.
30|And I won't introduce you...
30|Is that all?
30|You made such a big deal out of it,
30|even I was starting to get a little scared.
30|I'm a bit disappointed.
30|Are you?
30|Sure! It sounds great to me.
30|I mean, I wouldn't want a total stranger doing it,
30|but you'll be doing it. Right, Nii-chan?
30|Then I'll be fine.
30|I'll clarify this.
30|No matter what you do to me, I won't be embarrassed.
30|If I give up before time expires, you win.
30|For an introduction to the great Kanbaru-sensei,
30|I think this is a bit too easy.
30|Actually, I'd hoped for something more challenging.
30|Okay, then we can start, right?
30|Sit down there.
30|Okay!
30|Ahhh.
30|Now, feel the terror
30|of the great Kanbaru-sensei for yourself.
30|Kanbaru-sensei's fetishistic ideas will lead to your defeat.
30|You must be overjoyed.
30|Did you just now understand?
30|But it isn't too late, Karen-chan.
30|I'm not messing with the exterior of your body.
30|I'm messing with the interior.
30|To simplify this,
30|it brings you pleasure.
30|Thin hairs are stimulating
30|the delicate parts of your body,
30|so it must feel good.
30|Not bad...
30|It makes me want to try harder.
30|If you give up now, Karen-chan, you'll feel good.
30|Or rather, you'll stop feeling good!
30|Oh, no...
30|Hearing her moan makes me feel really weird...
30|It makes my heart race!
30|3 minutes 24 seconds
30|Tsukihi Phoenix Chapter
30|She really is cute...
30|This is seriously bad.
30|Was Karen always this cute?
30|Huh? Huh? Huh?
30|This is just a possibility,
30|but could my sister be the cutest girl in the world?
30|I've always thought Hanekawa Tsubasa was the ideal woman,
30|but could I have been mistaken?
30|Even if she isn't better than Hanekawa,
30|she could still give her a good run for her money.
30|No, no, no... Wait!
30|What am I saying?
30|No human could match Hanekawa.
30|This is a hallucination!
30|This special situation is weakening me. That's all!
30|I know that! I know that!
30|B-But...
30|K-Karen-chan...
30|Karen-chan...
30|Nii-chan...
30|It's okay.
30|What are you doing?
30|Onii-chan, Karen-chan, please tell me what, exactly, is going on here?
30|W-Wait, Tsukihi-chan!
30|It's not what you think!
30|Why is my brother happily pushing Karen-chan
30|into the bed, while brushing her teeth?
30|Why is Karen-chan wearing my clothes and
30|happily smiling, while being pushed into the bed by my brother?
30|Why am I pushing my little sister into
30|the bed with a smile, while brushing her teeth?!
30|Why am I wearing my little sister's clothes,
30|smiling, as my big brother pushes me into the bed?!
30|What a surprise!
30|Y-You saved us, Tsukihi-chan!
30|Thank you!
30|Would the judge be merciful?
30|Would there be room for extenuating circumstances?
30|Let there at least be a stay of execution,
30|Karen-chan and I hoped.
30|Would you two stay like that, just for a moment?
30|I'm running to the convenience store to buy an awl.
30|There would not be.
30|We were given the death penalty.
30|Tsukihi-chan, I don't think they sell awls at the convenience store.
30|You'd have to go to a specialty goods store!
30|Nii-chan, you're heavy.
30|Oh, sorry.
30|Closed
30|So, Nii-chan, about our game...
30|It's way past five minutes.
30|Crap...
30|Fine... A promise is a promise.
30|Okay, Karen-chan.
30|I'll introduce you to Kanbaru.
30|You did well, Karen-chan.
30|You win.
30|I lose today.
30|I'll accept it.
30|N-Nii-chan?
30|What?
30|I-If you really insist, and only because you insist,
30|we can go best out of three.
30|You know, Tsukihi-chan interrupted midway.
30|That normally means it's a tie.
30|A-And there's still time before Tsukihi-chan gets back...
30|We can go into extra innings if you want.
30|Uh...
30|O-Okay, maybe I will...
30|Y-Yeah.
30|Now that you've said that, I can't turn you down.
30|I accept... I accept your challenge!
30|Th-This time, you want to do me?
30|Y-Yeah, th-that's fairer.
30|And so, starting that morning, Karen and I
30|began to get along a little better.
31|I decided it would be best
31|if I kept my promise as soon as I could.
31|And after barely escaping Tsukihi's awls,
31|I called Kanbaru's phone.
31|Kanbaru Suruga
31|Araragi-sempai, I'd really prefer that you not.
31|It's true that I said I wanted to meet your sister,
31|but that was a joke.
31|Temporary Shutdown
31|I wasn't serious.
31|No, well...
31|Araragi-sempai,
31|I mean, I'm really grateful for your kindness.
31|But I can't take your little sister's virginity!
31|charge forward
31|I'm not giving it to you!
31|I'd rather take it myself than give it to you!
31|The thought's enough for me.
31|Don't take the thought, either...
31|You can't have anything of my sister's!
31|And so, with some difficulty,
31|I promised to bring Karen to her this afternoon.
31|Okay, I'll get dressed and wait for you.
31|Why are you usually naked?
31|Episode 9: Tsukihi Phoenix, Part 2
31|Nii-chan, Nii-chan...
31|Do you know how to win every time at rock-paper-scissors?
31|Just knowing how will change
31|your rock-paper-scissors life forever.
31|Normally, I'd just keep it to myself...
31|But thanks to you, this is a great day.
31|So I'll tell you specially.
31|I haven't even told Tsukihi-chan!
31|Fine, fine.
31|I'll listen to it.
31|Your kind, wonderful Koyomi-oniichan will listen to you.
31|Okay!
31|If you're that insistent, I'll tell you.
31|Let's try it.
31|But you know,
31|just learning it normally won't motivate you...
31|We should bet something.
31|Don't bother.
31|It's a pain.
31|No, we have to...
31|Or there's a possibility that later, you'll say, "I deliberately lost!"
31|I think deliberately losing at rock-paper-scissors is just as hard as always winning.
31|Okay, let's do this, Niii-chan.
31|An athletic punishment game.
31|The loser has to carry the winner the rest of the way.
31|Carry?
31|On their back!
31|Carriers Get Priority
31|Carry them all the way there.
31|Whatever.
31|If I lose, I just have to go back on it.
31|Okay, I get it.
31|That's fine.
31|You agreed more easily than I expected.
31|I'm not planning anything.
31|Trust your brother.
31|He'd never break his word...
31|That's right...
31|You're my pride!
31|I've probably broken thousands of promises to her.
31|Why would she trust me this much?
31|Let's go... Rock, paper—
31|Wait, wait, wait!
31|That's not how you do it.
31|You have to say the words yourself.
31|That's the first stage of the trick.
31|The first stage?
31|That's a lot of work to go through for rock-paper-scissors.
31|How many stages are there?
31|Two!
31|Mind the Step
31|Simple!
31|So what, you gain an advantage by saying it yourself?
31|Sounds kind of spiritual...
31|Not that it matters.
31|Then you say it.
31|Okay!
31|Here I go...
31|Rock!
31|Paper!
31|Do you get it?
31|Do you get it, Nii-chan?
31|You say rock, then paper, and then you put out your hand.
31|Thus, you can make your opponent,
31|who was waiting for the "scissors," go late.
31|The ultimate technique,
31|using the game's very name to cause your opponent to go late.
31|In other words, whether you throw rock, paper, or scissors,
31|since you've put your fist out too late,
31|I automatically win.
31|Now, Nii-chan, you're going to carry me!
31|Black scene
31|That's cheating.
31|What kind of idiot would admit defeat over that?!
31|And I just thought of it, too.
31|You just thought of it?
31|Karen-chan, you lost because you cheated.
31|Carrying me on your back isn't good enough.
31|You have to carry me on your shoulders.
31|Oh, fine...
31|Okay, Nii-chan.
31|Get on my shoulders.
31|Um, well...
31|Let's not, Karen-chan.
31|I've been studying too much. I've gained weight.
31|How much do you weigh?
31|Um, 56 kilograms.
31|Then I'll be fine.
31|Anything less than 180 kilos is nothing to me.
31|30 kg on the Moon
31|Do you live on the moon?!
31|P-Putting that aside,
31|it's one thing if you're carrying me on your back.
31|But on your shoulders, your ponytail is in the way.
31|Oh, my ponytail...
31|That's right.
31|Right?
31|You're right!
31|That's my brother.
31|You're always right!
31|A key?
31|Why are you taking out a key now?
31|Don't you use the ridges of a key when you
31|cut vinyl tape or tags on your clothes?
31|It's a lot lighter!
31|Oh, perfect. There's a trash can.
31|Right! Now I can carry you on my shoulders.
31|You've had that ponytail since elementary school!
31|Don't you have any attachment to it?!
31|It's long, and hard to take care of,
31|and a pain when I'm trying to sleep.
31|And when I get up, it's a mess.
31|I've always hated it.
31|You kept it anyway?
31|Okay, Nii-chan, let me carry you.
31|Let me carry you... Let me carry you!
31|Why is she so excited?
31|Why is she so excited, when she's the one doing the carrying?
31|My sister is totally a masochist!
31|This is all just a punishment game for me.
31|Um...
31|I'm standing up now.
31|Scared! Scared! Scared! Scared!
31|It's too high and very scary!
31|Neo-Tokyo 3
31|Let me down. Let me down.
31|Let me down now!
31|I'm sorry! Please let me down, Karen-san!
31|No, Karen-sama!
31|Nii-chan, got a sec?
31|What?
31|Your crotch is pressing into the back of my head, and it doesn't feel good.
31|Well, Nii-chan?
31|Don't you think we should cut off your crotch,
31|like I cut off my ponytail, to be fair?
31|Koyomi
31|Too scary!
31|Your hair might grow back,
31|but if you cut me off down there, it's over
31|in a lot of ways for a lot of things!
31|I see.
31|Still, Nii-chan, the weight isn't a problem.
31|But if you move too much, it throws me off balance. Can you stay put?
31|Don't be crazy...
31|I'm not like you.
31|I can't keep my balance with my head as high as a giraffe's.
31|Oh, fine.
31|It might take a little effort, Nii-chan,
31|but put your weight forward.
31|Put your head out, in front of my shoulders.
31|Right / Wrong / Shut the hell up.
31|Then hook your legs under my arms.
31|I'll lock them like the bar at an amusement park.
31|Like this?
31|All right!
31|Okay, now we're fine.
31|No, I'm not very fine.
31|I can't move a finger.
31|And my legs are going numb...
31|Hey, Karen-sama,
31|you don't think you've cut off the circulation, do you?
31|But it's easier for me.
31|Your calves were pressing into my breasts, and it felt weird.
31|And your crotch was pressing into my head,
31|and I was stuck between your legs.
31|Nii-chan, is giving someone a ride on your shoulders always this erotic?
31|No, normally the guy carries the girl.
31|Then let's go, Nii-chan.
31|You... Devil boy...
31|I'd like to ask you something.
31|Is that all right?
31|Well... I'm looking for a place called Eikou Cram School.
31|Do you know where it is?
31|Well...
31|What is it, devil boy?
31|When you were little,
31|didn't they teach you to help others?
31|Um...
31|How would an objective third party view this situation?
31|Which of us is weirder? The one atop the mailbox,
31|or the one atop his little sister?
31|I think she has the upper hand.
31|I can understand why she's calling me a devil boy.
31|My name is Kagenui Yodzuru.
31|Do you know me?
31|Gaze
31|My name is Araragi Koyomi.
31|I'm Araragi Karen.
31|A devilish brother and a hornet sister.
31|Interesting.
31|Did she just say "hornet"?
31|Looks like that's over, so it doesn't matter.
31|So, well?
31|I'll repeat my question.
31|Do you know where Eikou Cram School is?
31|Let's see...
31|Hold on a second.
31|A friend of mine
31|has the rather terrifying talent of having memorized
31|locations for every cram school in Japan.
31|Okay, I'll do it...
31|I'll call Hanekawa-san!
31|Yay!
31|Hanekawa Tsubasa
31|Here I am.
31|This is Hanekawa.
31|Araragi-kun, are you studying?
31|Are you slacking off?
31|That's good to hear.
31|Me? Yeah, it's fine.
31|I was just doing some afternoon studying.
31|Red Scene
31|Eikou Cram School?
31|Yeah, I know it.
31|She really knew it.
31|You know everything.
31|I don't know everything.
31|I just know what I know.
31|Anyway, you should know Eikou Cram School yourself.
31|Because it's...
31|It's the abandoned building where Oshino-san and Shinobu-chan lived.
31|The cram school in that building was Eikou Cram School.
31|Eikou Cram School, huh?
31|I didn't know it had such a smart-sounding name.
31|It's nothing worth thanking me for...
31|Bye, Araragi-kun.
31|Say hi to Kanbaru-san for me.
31|Bye-bye!
31|I didn't say anything about going to see Kanbaru...
31|I was just asking her about a cram school.
31|How much of my private life does she know?
31|That's too steep a price!
31|You figure it out?
31|Devil boy.
31|Yes, well...
31|Explaining
31|I see.
31|So there's where it is.
31|But Kagenui-san, it's gone out of business.
31|Why are you going there?
31|Nothing special, I suppose...
31|First, to establish a base of operations.
31|Goodbye then, devil boy.
31|Oh, right...
31|You might get asked the same sort of thing
31|by a girl about this high.
31|Be as kind to her as you were to me.
31|What?
31|You've been really quiet, Karen-chan.
31|What's wrong?
31|Don't make me deal with a strange human like that alone!
31|Oh, sorry.
31|I was just thinking she was really strong.
31|So I was readying myself.
31|Strong?
31|Really?
31|She didn't look it.
31|Except for the way she acted and spoke,
31|she seemed like just an ordinary pretty woman.
31|Her center of gravity stayed constant,
31|the entire time she was chatting with you.
31|She had the balance of a figure skater.
31|But you also walk along the tops of walls, right?
31|And while handstanding.
31|Yeah, that's true...
31|But she's spent a lot of time training.
31|Her fists were perfectly shaped for punching people.
31|W-Were they?
31|Yeah. If she hit a car's bumper, she could set off the airbags.
31|Goodbye SRS
31|She's probably as good as my teacher...
31|I couldn't beat her myself.
31|My, Karen-san...
31|You're sounding pretty wimpy.
31|I can tell any difference in strength,
31|so long as my opponent isn't evil.
31|I see.
31|But I don't know for sure that she isn't.
31|After that, I took Karen to Kanbaru's front gate,
31|and introduced them to each other.
31|This is Kanbaru Suruga-san, a second-year at Naoetsu High.
31|She's a pervert, so be careful.
31|This is Araragi Karen-san, a third-year at Tsuganoki 2nd Middle School.
31|She's an idiot, so be careful.
31|Don't both blush at the same time...
31|Those weren't compliments!
31|Sister Brother
31|After seeing my sister to Kanbaru's,
31|I started home without any handstanding or riding on someone's shoulders,
31|Hachikuji Mayoi 5-3
31|when I found Hachikuji.
31|Jeez...
31|I'm certain you all expect me to leap on Hachikuji, in a burst of joy...
31|You all expect me to grab a girl,
31|innocent as a newborn fawn, from behind
31|and start rubbing my face against her.
31|No, I admit it.
31|There was a time when I would have.
31|There was.
31|But I'm an adult now.
31|I've no interest in the little girl called Hachikuji Mayoi.
31|But I suppose, given that I have no interest in her,
31|I've no particular reason to ignore her...
31|If I ignore her, she may get the impudent
31|and brazen idea that I'm deliberately ignoring her.
31|In light of this, and only in light of this, mind you,
31|it may mean that the smartest option would be to call out and greet her,
31|to prove how disinterested I am in Hachikuji.
31|Okay, then...
31|With that conclusion reached, it's time to get started.
31|I'm not hesitant in the least.
31|I have to go home and study, or Hanekawa will get mad at me.
31|But I'll spare a single minute for Hachikuji.
31|Now...
31|Now it's time to grab her as hard as I can...
31|To rub my cheek against her...
31|To touch and rub her...
31|To love her as much as I can...
31|Today, I shall embrace Hachikuji!
31|Hachikuji!
31|Araragi-san!
31|Shinobu, was that you?!
31|Damn! Damn you, damn you, damn you!
31|What were you doing? What?!
31|You screwed it up!
31|You screwed up the biggest event of my life!
31|No more blood for you, you golden-eyed blondie...
31|I should've abandoned you!
31|U-Um...
31|Um, Kikirara-san?
31|Hachikuji,
31|don't confuse my name with that of the little twin sisters of fancy goods.
31|My name is Araragi.
31|And when I flew past you,
31|you got it right.
31|Sorry. I bit my tongue.
31|No, you did it deliberately.
31|I smiled!
31|Too cute!
31|You're as bad at ad-libbing as ever...
31|No Cars
31|Off-Limits Detour
31|Anyway, Araragi-san, you must have lots of free time
31|on your hands to be wandering the city at this hour.
31|Have you given up on studying?
31|Wandering?
31|Have you given up on pretending to study to make Hanekawa-san like you?
31|That's really mean!
31|Failure as a Person
31|Well, she's not the type you could fool forever.
31|Let me guess.
31|She realized you were pretending to study so you could see her in her camisole.
31|Since half your motivation comes from her boobs.
31|What kind of person do you see me as?
31|The rest of it is from my hot, curvy body!
31|Where is your body hot and curvy?
31|Your body's more barrel-shaped...
31|You could make some delicious beef stew out of it.
31|Failure as a Person
31|I do like you, but I don't like flat lolis.
31|Danger
31|I only talk to you because you have big boobs, for an elementary schooler.
31|I'm taking a chance on the future of your
31|presently underwhelming bust.
31|Failure as a Person
31|No human being would ever say that.
31|But anyway, Hachikuji...
31|I'm dating Senjougahara, and I love Hanekawa.
31|But I plan to marry you.
31|Please don't be the first person to propose to me!
31|Danger Zone
31|Actually, don't propose to elementary schoolers.
31|Hmm... No luck, huh?
31|How can I get the overwhelming passion
31|in my chest to reach Hachikuji's heart?
31|Danger Zone
31|Touch it directly, maybe?
31|Will fondling them make her understand?
31|Black Scene
31|Oh, my.
31|Danger Zone
31|I sense the presence of something bad.
31|Be careful, Hachikuji.
31|I'm always after your breasts.
31|Given the slightest opportunity, I'd drop whatever I'm doing, to touch them.
31|Karabuki
31|By the way, Karabuki-san.
31|It's true that I plan to clean Kanbaru's room tomorrow,
31|but that doesn't make me a cleaning maniac who loves to clean.
31|Don't call me by a name that sounds like I clean with a dried karabuki cloth...
31|My name is Araragi!
31|Sorry. I bit my tongue.
31|No, you did it deliberately.
31|Failure as a Person
31|I bit you.
31|A love-bite?!
31|Yes!
31|This time, I ad-libbed a response...
31|I can do it!
31|Hey, devil boy.
31|No entry.
31|If you know, please tell me
31|which way I want to go...
31|I said, with a posed look.
31|No Entry
31|Danger Zone
31|I'm told there's a cram school
31|that went out of business called Eikou Cram School.
31|Do you know where it is, devil boy?
31|I said, with a posed look.
31|My name is Ononoki Yotsugi.
31|I said, with a posed look.
31|That's a stupid phrase.
31|And where the hell is your posed look?
31|Danger Zone
31|I see. I'm Araragi Koyomi.
31|Hello, devil boy.
31|I said, with a posed look.
31|Hi...
31|Um, Eikou Cram School is...
31|Construction Sorry for the Trouble
31|Turn Right
31|All right. Thank you.
31|You were a big help, devil boy.
31|And snail girl.
31|I said, with a posed look.
31|Danger Zone
31|Huh?
31|Danger Zone
31|Did she just call you "snail girl"?
31|Yeah, she did.
31|Huh?
31|Isn't that strange?
31|Come to think of it, Kagenui-san...
31|Kagenui Yodzuru...
31|She didn't just call me a devil boy.
31|She said something about Karen.
31|A devilish brother and a hornet sister.
31|Interesting.
31|Devil Devil Boy
31|Devil...
31|Devils who suck blood...
31|Vampires
31|Vampires.
31|Anyway, Araragi-san, from what I saw, she looked pretty capable.
31|You'd have to be as good as my master to be a match for her.
31|White Scene To be continued
31|You don't have a master.
32|Red Scene
32|Master,
32|I have something important to discuss with you.
32|Well?
32|Do you have a moment to talk?
32|It can't be later?
32|Can't it wait until I'm done studying?
32|It's actually a rather serious situation,
32|one requiring drastic action.
32|What is it?
32|Very well...
32|I'll listen.
32|Master,
32|according to secret information I've acquired,
32|Mister Donuts is having
32|100-Yen Donut Sale
32|a sale where any donut costs 100 yen!
32|If we don't leave immediately, they'll sell out...
32|Fine, fine.
32|I'll go to buy you some before dinner,
32|so I can get out of the house.
32|You like golden chocolate, right?
32|No.
32|Take me there.
32|I want to choose for myself!
32|It's really sunny out.
32|Will you be okay?
32|I'll just get a nasty sunburn.
32|I'm not really a normal vampire anymore.
32|I won't even need sunscreen,
32|just a hat should suffice.
32|No, I'll let you know when we're at the store.
32|Until then, stay in my shadow.
32|You'd prefer to minimize your time in the sun, right?
32|Yes. The sun is my enemy.
32|It'll only take thirty minutes or so.
32|Be sure you stay awake.
32|See you soon, then.
32|Bye.
32|Episode 10: Tsukihi Phoenix, Part 3
32|Onii-chan?
32|Heading out again?
32|Yeah... I am.
32|Onii-chan, will Karen-chan be home late again today?
32|I dunno.
32|I see.
32|Well, when she's really into something,
32|she stops paying attention to her surroundings.
32|Why? Did you have something to discuss with her?
32|Aren't you done with your Fire Sisters stuff?
32|Yeah, it's really nothing...
32|But you know, well,
32|I haven't been spending much time with her lately.
32|I'm sure you've already figured this out,
32|but I'm not as into justice as she is.
32|I like justice, and I love justice,
32|but I don't really have any clear image of it inside me.
32|You know how Karen-chan says,
32|"My blood of justice won't forgive you!" and stuff like that?
32|And "My blood of justice burns"? Like that?
32|She does.
32|But I've never felt that way before.
32|She has it within her, and I don't.
32|The justice I have faith in
32|is her brand and yours.
32|If she wasn't so sure about it,
32|I wouldn't believe in something as vague as justice.
32|In that sense, you're right.
32|My justice is fake.
32|The reason I talk about it is because
32|I'm too easily influenced by the people around me.
32|If Karen-chan does what she does for other people,
32|I do it because of them.
32|We two have always been different in that way.
32|So, Onii-chan...
32|Lately, I've begun thinking it's time to put the Fire Sisters to bed.
32|Sounds good to me.
32|Actually, I think you two have gotten along too well up to this point.
32|I know it isn't anything that can be helped...
32|Once she reaches high school,
32|will she bully me like you do?
32|Don't talk about me like that!
32|I consider myself a helpful, and reliable, older brother.
32|Helpful?
32|You mean like brushing our teeth, while touching our breasts?
32|Okay, I've decided.
32|Once Karen-chan returns,
32|we'll discuss the future of the Fire Sisters!
32|What? So you might split up?
32|It is possible...
32|We have creative differences!
32|If she wants to go at it alone, I won't stop her.
32|I shall swallow my tears, watching her go!
32|Come to our farewell party, okay?
32|I'll invite lots of middle-school girls and stuff.
32|Fine... I'll make the time to go.
32|So, my helpful brother,
32|weren't you going to leave?
32|Oh, that's right...
32|Watch the house, okay?
32|I'll be home soon.
32|Need me to pick up anything?
32|Nope. See you.
32|See me...
32|And get back to your room.
32|I can't open the door with you here, dressed like that
32|Stop wandering around partially clothed, is what I'm saying.
32|Don't dress like that.
32|Hey, Tsukihi-chan...
32|I'm gonna take that off.
32|Wh-What?
32|Stop it, Onii-chan...
32|What are you doing?
32|No!
32|Black Scene
32|I knew it.
32|What? What? What?
32|What's going on?
32|Why is my brother stripping off my clothes,
32|grabbing my hands, and pushing me down?
32|Um, Tsukihi-chan...
32|Didn't you have a scar here?
32|The scar that should have been there is gone.
32|The doctors were certain that
32|the scar would never, ever fade, but...
32|Wait. There aren't any scars on your body...
32|Scars heal. I'm a human being!
32|Yeah, I guess so.
32|And just get off me, Onii-chan.
32|If you wanted to see if the scar was there,
32|you didn't have to grab my hands and get on top of me.
32|That's... That's true.
32|Why did you grab my breast, before getting off me?
32|Just because.
32|It was right in front of me, so I wondered how it would feel.
32|That's the only reason?!
32|Yeah, see...
32|Squish squish squish squish.
32|Don't touch me with your feet!
32|It isn't making any fun sound effects like that!
32|Jeez, Onii-chan, you're touching your little sisters' body way too much!
32|Um, if someone only heard that line,
32|they'd get some really strange ideas about me.
32|Jeez...
32|Jeez, jeez, jeez!
32|Why is it that sisters have pure relationships with their boyfriends,
32|but are still required to have a physical relationship with their brother?
32|Oh...
32|What was his name?
32|Your boyfriend.
32|Rosokuzawa-kun?
32|You haven't split up yet?
32|Sorry, but I'm in love.
32|Karen-chan's boyfriend, Mizudori-kun,
32|hasn't been getting along with her as well lately.
32|But I think they're all right, too.
32|Okay, I'm leaving now.
32|Don't bother coming home!
32|There's no home for you!
32|No, I'm coming back...
32|Inside your heart!
32|Flocky chou?
32|What is this? Is such a thing possible?
32|To combine the pon de ring and the French cruller...
32|Incredible!
32|Old-fashioned!
32|Just looking at it reveals how delicious it must be.
32|I can tell! I don't even have to eat it.
32|I will, though!
32|And the mere name "tofu donut" entices me...
32|And look at these muffins, lined up like jewels...
32|Why was the existence of these muffins hidden from me?
32|Curse them! Unforgivable.
32|However, and there's no need to even say this,
32|the best part is having all the wonderful
32|donuts I've consumed so far,
32|including the golden chocolate, laid out before me, in such numbers!
32|Incredible!
32|Master, can I eat them all?
32|Black Scene
32|Of course not!
32|Then what?!
32|I will be forced to select a few for my meal,
32|from the dozens upon dozens set out here?
32|I'll bring you once a month or something.
32|So you can wait.
32|Hmm,
32|I suppose you can pick three to start.
32|Oh, my master...
32|Don't be so foolish.
32|If you're thinking about the future,
32|then why not consider this an investment
32|for getting on my good side?
32|What happens if I get on your good side?
32|Oh, fine... Yeah, yeah.
32|Let's do this...
32|Let's each choose five.
32|Ten total.
32|And we can share.
32|But no muffins and no pies.
32|They aren't part of the 100-yen sale.
32|Very well.
32|I accept.
32|So, Shinobu...
32|I wanted to ask you something.
32|On my way to Kanbaru's place, and when I was coming back,
32|those two girls who asked me for directions...
32|The older, with the Kyoto accent, and the younger of the "posed look."
32|What did you think of them?
32|I suppose I could tell you about the posed look one.
32|What do you mean?
32|She wasn't human.
32|She was a supernatural creature.
32|She took on human form,
32|but like me, she isn't the age she appears.
32|And Ononoki Yotsugi is, of course, an alias.
32|Ononoki Yotsugi
32|I was wondering about her first name, Yotsugi.
32|Kagenui Yodzuru
32|Her first name sounds just like that Kagenui girl.
32|She's probably using the name to bind her!
32|Just like I'm bound by that brat in the Hawaiian shirt.
32|Oshino Meme
32|Oshino Shinobu
32|Basically, Ononoki Yotsugi is Kagenui Yodzuru's familiar.
32|Familiar?
32|That's what you'd call it in your culture.
32|A shikigami, perhaps?
32|So, of the two,
32|Kagenui is one of those specialists...
32|I'm not going to share information about a respectable person.
32|I don't really want you to use me as a tool.
32|You won't be able to get me to talk
32|just by buying me donuts.
32|I'm not that cheap a woman.
32|I'm not your servant or your shikigami.
32|If you really insist on knowing,
32|why not ask the man sitting in the seat over there?
32|Kaiki-san,
32|after all that grandstanding when you left,
32|why are you here, eating donuts?
32|Some minor business.
32|Just unpleasant, minor business.
32|Araragi, it's nothing for you to concern yourself over.
32|I'll be gone shortly.
32|I'd prefer if you left now.
32|Don't be in such a hurry.
32|I didn't ever want to see you again, either.
32|Because of you, I lost a lot of money.
32|You do know Kagenui Yodzuru and Ononoki Yotsugi, right?
32|You want to know about them? I'll tell you.
32|Pay up.
32|Fine...
32|How much do I need to pay, for you to tell me?
32|Let me see.
32|That will do.
32|Araragi.
32|I'll allow you to pay with this meager change, as a gift
32|to honor your relationship with Senjougahara.
32|Tell me...
32|Kagenui Yodzuru and Ononoki Yotsugi!
32|They are specialists...
32|Ghost busters like me.
32|Of course, while I'm a fake, they're real.
32|I'm a con man, and they are onmyouji.
32|Onmyouji?
32|Naturally, I said "they."
32|But to be precise, Kagenui is the onmyouji,
32|and Ononoki is her shikigami.
32|You know them?
32|Why would you think so?
32|Well, the way you talked.
32|Just the way you spoke implied it.
32|I merely know their names.
32|Kagenui is rather famous in the business.
32|Kagenui Yodzuru and Ononoki Yotsugi,
32|modern-day onmyouji.
32|Hey, Araragi,
32|they're specialists, but they specialize in a very limited field.
32|That two-person cell specializes
32|in immortal creatures.
32|An onmyouji specializing in immortal monsters?
32|Jeez...
32|Then they're probably after you and me.
32|You think we're their targets?
32|But perhaps we are not, my master.
32|I've eaten many immortal creatures.
32|I kill the immortal, too.
32|Timed Light 1
32|Timed Light
32|And the supernatural isn't immortal.
32|Timed Light 3
32|It isn't even alive.
32|Yeah...
32|Well, I guess if you're not living, you can't die.
32|So I guess anything supernatural is immortal.
32|But strict definitions aside,
32|when you say that they might not be after us, Shinobu,
32|does that mean there are vampires in this city besides us?
32|It doesn't have to be vampires.
32|It wouldn't be strange.
32|No.
32|I suppose it would.
32|Come to think of it,
32|even just among those I know,
32|many people have supernatural creatures inside them.
32|Like Kanbaru Suruga, with a monkey in her left hand.
32|Or Hanekawa Tsubasa, with a cat inside her mind.
32|So it wouldn't be particularly odd if there were others
32|housing creatures that I don't know about.
32|Kagenui-san and Ononoki-chan.
32|If they're setting up base in the same abandoned building as Oshino,
32|Homeless
32|they're likely in the same business. I should deal with them quickly.
32|Black Scene
32|You...
32|Hi.
32|First, I should thank you.
32|I followed the directions you gave me,
32|and it led me to the Eikou Cram School.
32|And you told Yotsugi, as well.
32|Um, I'm sorry...
32|I'd like to make something clear.
32|You came to this city to exterminate us, right?
32|You've come to kill her, an immortal creature not of this world,
32|along with me, her servant, yes?
32|Both of you asking me for directions was no coincidence.
32|You were investigating me.
32|Devil boy,
32|you seem to be under a misapprehension.
32|Matters pertaining to the iron-blooded, cold-blooded, hot-blooded
32|killer of monsters and lord of the night,
32|Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade,
32|have already been resolved.
32|And our industry hardly has the free time
32|to squander resources on a normal human
32|with a few lingering aftereffects.
32|Of course, that's thanks to Oshino-kun's habitual interference and meddling.
32|Oshino-kun?
32|Did she just say Oshino-kun?
32|Yellow Scene
32|Hey, master. Focus.
32|You have other things to think about now.
32|That's right. That's right...
32|If they aren't here for Oshino Shinobu and Araragi Koyomi,
32|then why have Kagenui-san and Ononoki-chan come?
32|Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up!
32|How long will you stand there, pressing the doorbell?
32|Can't you tell I'm pretending not to be here?!
32|Unlimited Rulebook.
32|I said, with a posed look.
32|Black Scene
32|Calm down, devil boy.
32|Don't get so worked up.
32|Oshino-kun would probably say something like,
32|"You're looking lively. Did something good happen?"
32|Shut up!
32|You...
32|You bastards...
32|You killed my sister...
32|My sister Tsukihi-chan...
32|I'll make you pay!
32|What, that was your sister?
32|I see.
32|Right, your name is Araragi, too.
32|I thought it was just a coincidence.
32|I understand.
32|Our information had some gaps.
32|Then that must have been a shock for you.
32|Sorry, sorry.
32|You think an apology will help?
32|Observe.
32|Devil boy,
32|you appear to have a thing for immortal creatures.
32|Your sister is possessed by an immortal bird.
32|That was never truly your sister.
32|It is human, yet not human.
32|What you see there is the rare firebird,
32|the evil phoenix.
32|I said, with a posed look.
32|Enough.
32|I will not allow any more of this.
32|You can't wish
32|to attract more attention than you already have, correct?
32|We don't care.
32|We're not clever enough to be concerned with time or place...
32|And how will you stop us?
32|What can you do?
32|Vampire...
32|Former vampire.
32|Without your skills, you're no threat to me.
32|Possibly!
32|But whether that's true for you, is it true for the girl?
32|I doubt she's strong enough
32|to withstand my energy drain.
32|And if I drain her dry,
32|I think I could handle you...
32|A bluff!
32|I'm not going to interfere with you.
32|But I shall request that you withdraw for now.
32|You could do that for me, couldn't you?
32|Time isn't an important factor for you.
32|Fine, then.
32|As you say, we'll leave now.
32|Let's go.
32|Despite what I said,
32|we have no interest in killing
32|a sister in front of her brother.
32|Naturally.
32|She isn't your real sister.
32|Not my real sister...
32|A fake sister?
32|I'm sure the devil boy
32|needs time to get this straight in his head.
32|We'll give you time, out of respect for the legendary vampire.
32|We'll pretend to fall for your bluff,
32|so prepare yourself in any way you like.
32|We'll return tomorrow.
32|Be sure everything has been handled by then.
32|Running won't help.
32|To be clear, neither of us is as easy to deal with as Oshino-kun.
32|We won't let any prey escape.
32|And if you try to stop us,
32|we'll ignore the ruling that decided you were harmless,
32|and we'll eliminate you, too.
32|Goodbye.
32|Why...
32|Why are you after Tsukihi-chan?
32|There's no reason for you to...
32|There is.
32|She's a supernatural creature...
32|A monstrous fake that snuck into a human family,
32|pretended to be human,
32|and deceived humans!
32|We call that evil.
32|We're the good guys...
32|So we cannot ignore a con like that.
32|We can't allow it.
33|The Dying Bird...
33|A type of supernatural cuckoo.
33|The cuckoo from the poem:
33|"I see green leaves and hear the mountain cuckoo's cry,
33|as I eat the first tuna of the year."
33|They lied when they said it was a phoenix.
33|This bird habitually plants its eggs in other birds' nests.
33|It waits for the mother bird of another species to leave,
33|and then pushes those eggs out of the nest, onto the ground.
33|Then it lays its own eggs,
33|for the mother bird to warm and hatch.
33|The supernatural cuckoo,
33|the Dying Bird, exhibits the same behavior.
33|It does the same thing.
33|It plants its egg in a human nest.
33|Inside the womb of a pregnant mother,
33|it reincarnates itself like a phoenix, the immortal bird.
33|The common legend of the phoenix
33|describes the bird, at its life's end,
33|throwing itself into the flames,
33|so it can be reborn.
33|In this case, the flame is a human mother.
33|To be precise, the Dying Bird's victim
33|is not your sister,
33|but is, instead, your mother.
33|Over ten years ago,
33|your mother carried a monster in her womb.
33|Body
33|Womb
33|And a year later, Araragi Tsukihi was born.
33|The Dying Bird was reborn.
33|In the larger scheme, it's a harmless creature.
33|It never hurts anyone.
33|But it is a fake.
33|And it is immortal.
33|Any wound heals instantly.
33|Any illness vanishes.
33|It lives out its lifespan.
33|And then it dies, and is reborn.
33|It has repeated this cycle up to the modern era.
33|Just like a cuckoo...
33|Episode 11: Tsukihi Phoenix, Part 4
33|Nii-chan, what is this?!
33|What happened?
33|An artillery strike?
33|Have syndicate pursuit teams fired a cannon at us?
33|Honestly, well...
33|I don't know.
33|I went to Mister Donuts, to take a study break,
33|and when I returned, it was like this.
33|Maybe a dump truck hit the house, before driving off.
33|So you've been standing guard...
33|Thanks!
33|But you haven't gotten to study at all today, have you?
33|I guess not.
33|Okay, Nii-chan, I'll take over!
33|Now it's my turn.
33|Until Mom and Dad get home,
33|I shall be Cerberus, Guardian of Hell.
33|So get back to your room and study.
33|By the way, where's Tsukihi-chan?
33|I think she was on the second floor when it happened.
33|She watched the front until I returned.
33|But since she was here when it happened,
33|it was a big shock.
33|She's out cold on the second floor.
33|Yeah...
33|She actually gets rattled pretty easily...
33|I'm sure you have things you'd like to ask her,
33|but she really is fast asleep.
33|Let her rest for a while.
33|Aye aye!
33|Karen-chan?
33|What is it, Nii-chan?
33|Would you be able to die for me?
33|Sure.
33|Why?
33|Then, could you die for Tsukihi-chan?
33|I could.
33|With a smile on my face.
33|She's my little sister.
33|Of course I could.
33|Yeah, of course.
33|And I'd die for you, too.
33|Again and again,
33|like some immortal Dracula.
33|Red Scene
33|I'd die every day until I was dead.
33|Immortal, huh?
33|Not a vampire,
33|but a phoenix, huh?
33|It's all so sudden...
33|I can't keep up with everything.
33|Hey.
33|Hey
33|Black Scene
33|What are you doing?!
33|I can't believe it...
33|This can't be happening!
33|My first kiss...
33|I was going to give it to Rosokuzawa!
33|What's so funny?!
33|Nothing...
33|I was just thinking that I felt nothing when I kissed you.
33|It wasn't exciting, and I didn't enjoy it.
33|You really are my sister.
33|Tsukihi-chan, did you know
33|that there was a time when I wasn't your brother?
33|What are you talking about?
33|There was a time when I wasn't Karen-chan's brother, either.
33|For the first three years of my life, I was an only child.
33|And the year after that, I only had one sister.
33|It was four years before I finally became your brother.
33|Well, yeah...
33|But, Tsukihi-chan...
33|Araragi Tsukihi has always been my little sister.
33|My little sister, as well as Karen-chan's little sister.
33|That has never been untrue.
33|Don't count my kiss...
33|That's how family works.
33|For example, when we were little,
33|how many times did we say we were gonna get married?
33|I couldn't tell you.
33|Of course, I would've married you both.
33|Stupid.
33|You think you can fool me by bringing up the past?
33|White Scene
33|I'm platinum mad...
33|Hey, Karen-chan.
33|I'm going out for a bit.
33|Okay, bye.
33|While I'm gone, keep an eye out.
33|No one gets in.
33|Leave it to me.
33|Karen-chan does whatever her brother says.
33|You're going, my master?
33|Yes, I am.
33|Where? To do what?
33|To them. To fight.
33|Why?
33|For my sister.
33|What will that gain you?
33|Nothing at all.
33|I'll only waste some time.
33|I see...
33|Tsukihi, was it?
33|Your miniscule sister.
33|Yeah...
33|What? You learned her name?
33|It's rare for you to learn a human's name.
33|After hearing you scream it so many times...
33|And it's a good name.
33|A good name?
33|Is it?
33|I like the "tsuki," from "moon," part.
33|The sun is my enemy,
33|but the moon has been quite good to me.
33|And so,
33|perhaps I shall repay it.
33|Okay.
33|Thanks.
33|No need for thanks...
33|Emergency Exit
33|Uninvited company...
33|Oshino-kun would say "Oh, you're late.
33|I've been waiting for you."
33|But I'm not that friendly.
33|Oshino...
33|Oshino was never so violent.
33|I'm sure that's true!
33|That's how he was...
33|That's how it is with him.
33|So what do we do?
33|An outright brawl is fine with us.
33|It's simple.
33|We're all about violence.
33|And thankfully, both of our teams include a human and a monster.
33|You and me.
33|And the former Heart-under-blade-chan; Yotsugi-chan.
33|How does that sound?
33|Not happy?
33|Then, I can take the former Heart-under-blade,
33|and you can have Yotsugi.
33|She's the one who attacked your sister, fake or not.
33|No,
33|the first pairing is better.
33|Excellent.
33|Then, girl,
33|come downstairs.
33|There's a perfect room on the second floor for us to fight in.
33|We can enjoy ourselves there.
33|I'll show you the difference that years of experience make.
33|Sure, that's fine.
33|Even after powering up, you're still weaker than I am.
33|Respect for the Elderly Day is still a month from now.
33|But if you're willing to force
33|that tired old body to show me the difference of years of experience,
33|I'll go with you,
33|Grannie.
33|I said, with a posed look.
33|You're a minor Far Eastern youkai,
33|lacking even existent texts about her.
33|I'll see to it that you can't ever have a posed look again.
33|Black Scene
33|Well, I'm off to take care of the elderly, Onee-chan.
33|I said, with a posed look.
33|Black Scene
33|Kagenui-san, what's your relationship to Oshino?
33|You know the idiot in the Hawaiian shirt, Oshino Meme?
33|What? Oshino-kun's still wearing those shirts?
33|I thought it was just some kind of trademark,
33|but if he's still doing it, perhaps there's a deeper reason...
33|Well, it's nothing really.
33|Just an old friend.
33|Oshino-kun, Kaiki-kun, and I
33|were all university classmates.
33|Oshino, okay...
33|But Kaiki?
33|Kaiki?
33|Did she say Kaiki?
33|Kaiki...
33|You mean Kaiki Deishuu?
33|Shinto Studies
33|Student Building
33|Gallery
33|Social Work Department
33|Cafeteria
33|That's right. Kaiki-kun...
33|We shared a major, and he was in my club.
33|Campus Map
33|We used to play four-person shogi with another upperclassman.
33|Was it the shogi research club?
33|No, the occult research club.
33|Actually, it was Kaiki-kun who was kind enough to tell us
33|about your sister.
33|Kaiki!
33|So this was all your fault?
33|It was all your doing?!
33|Kagenui-san.
33|I'm on my sister's side in this.
33|Your sister is a fake.
33|She isn't your real sister.
33|Even if you recognize that the sister you believed to be real is a fake,
33|can you truly love her, as you always have?
33|I can.
33|No, I'll love her even more.
33|Isn't it hot,
33|Black Scene
33|having a sister who isn't your real sister?!
33|Red Scene
33|I understand your feelings.
33|And I suppose I must respect them.
33|But from the perspective of a good guy like me...
33|Yellow Scene
33|Nothing I say will change your mind.
33|I've given up trying to convince you.
33|I'm different from Oshino-kun and Kaiki-kun, after all.
33|I can only speak with my fists.
33|But... But...
33|I wonder.
33|Even if you're all right with it...
33|Red Scene
33|Yellow Scene
33|Red Scene
33|Even if you're all right with it,
33|how about the rest of your family?!
33|You were once immortal.
33|So perhaps you'd be fine
33|with a fake sister who's an immortal creature.
33|But how about the rest of your family?
33|Those who have nothing to do with the supernatural?
33|For example, Karen-chan, was it?
33|If your other sister knew her little sister
33|is a supernatural creature,
33|could she answer the same way?
33|Or your mother?
33|If she knew that she birthed a monster,
33|could she say the same thing as you?
33|What about your father?!
33|And what about her?
33|If the fake knew everything,
33|could she continue living
33|like she always has?
33|Everything's all right now, because she doesn't know.
33|But when she finds out,
33|won't she be hurt?
33|An immortal monster cannot adapt to its surroundings...
33|You should know that better than anyone.
33|Or will she try to be a hero, with her inhuman body?
33|The Fire Sisters, wasn't it?
33|But how proud, how cruel
33|could an immortal monster be toward humans?
33|You know that better than anyone, as well!
33|Black Scene
33|Red Scene
33|Our job is to stop it before that happens.
33|Whatever you value...
33|What you consider right is up to you.
33|But don't force it onto other people!
33|Red Scene
33|I'm not finished yet.
33|I'm starting to worry about Yotsugi, also.
33|Let's go take a look!
33|What are you doing,
33|my master?
33|What?
33|For all her big talk, this is as far as she got?
33|Looks like you're having a tough time, Yotsugi.
33|I was preparing to stage an elaborate comeback.
33|Don't worry about me when you don't have to, Onee-chan.
33|I said, with a posed look.
33|Right, right.
33|But allow your sister to have this pleasure.
33|Former Heart-under-blade,
33|want to have a final round with me?
33|No, I won't fight.
33|And a final round?
33|Don't be stupid, human.
33|My master hasn't lost to you yet.
33|Correct, my master?
33|That's right.
33|I haven't lost yet...
33|I haven't conceded to you yet.
33|Not to your fists or to your words.
33|I haven't accepted either!
33|Didn't you listen to me?
33|Whatever you value...
33|What you consider right is up to you.
33|But don't force those ideals onto other people.
33|It isn't "other people."
33|Not "other people."
33|It's my family.
33|I'll force my ideals on my family.
33|And since they're family, I'll lie to them.
33|I'll deceive them. I'll cause trouble for them.
33|I'll make them worry.
33|I'll owe them things...
33|Things I'll never be able to repay.
33|However, I think that's okay.
33|Kagenui-san...
33|Miss Good Guy.
33|If you say that being a fake is evil,
33|then I will shoulder the burden of that evil.
33|If lying is evil,
33|then I'm fine with being evil.
33|I don't need them to like me.
33|I'm fine with being the worst kind of person.
33|Onii-chan!
33|As long as she calls me that,
33|it's enough for me...
33|The theory of fundamental evil?
33|As a high school student, you've learned the theory of fundamental good, right?
33|It was a concept developed by Chinese philosopher Mencius.
33|He said that humans are born fundamentally good.
33|That's the one.
33|Um...
33|If the theory of fundamental good is an ideal,
33|the theory of fundamental evil is simple realism.
33|Desire lies at the core of human nature.
33|And humans are ruled by these desires.
33|That was the less tactful theory of Xun Zi.
33|He claimed that humans are born evil.
33|Born
33|evil?
33|Yes.
33|Thus, if a person does good,
33|that is not their true self, but a lie.
33|That was his theory.
33|It would be a lie, a fake,
33|and due only to hypocrisy...
33|Hypocrisy.
33|Artificial. And thus, by definition, deliberate.
33|He said all good is thereby hypocrisy, and therefore,
33|it constitutes a deliberate attempt to be good.
33|It was a game that Kaiki-kun often used to discuss...
33|Given the real thing, and an indistinguishable fake,
33|which is worth more?
33|The real thing and a fake...
33|Naturally, my response was that
33|the real thing was worth more.
33|Oshino-kun asserted that they had equal value, though.
33|But here is Kaiki-kun's argument:
33|The fake is of far greater value.
33|In its deliberate attempt to be real,
33|it's more real than the real thing.
33|Kaiki-kun's such a petty villain,
33|but he does say some neat things.
33|I suppose you could say
33|that's the lesson for us here.
33|It took us ten years to learn, though.
33|We're leaving.
33|We lose.
33|U-Um, Kagenui-san?
33|Bored.
33|We're leaving.
33|I can't fight when I'm feeling strange like this.
33|Unlimited Rulebook.
33|You can shoot a bird, but not one that's nesting.
33|Unlimited Rulebook A rulebook mostly filled with exceptions.
33|We'll just call your little sister an exception.
33|In a way, you're her mentor, so keep a close watch over her.
33|Anyway, you weren't ever
33|really serious about fighting us, were you?
33|We weren't serious?
33|I never sensed a desire to kill.
33|I don't think you were holding back.
33|But to be honest, it wasn't much fun for me.
33|If you didn't think I wanted to kill you,
33|that's because you treated me like a human being, Kagenui-san.
33|You said we both had a human and a monster, right?
33|Since I became this way, only Oshino referred to me as a human being.
33|So I'm the one who wasn't really into it.
33|I felt weird, and I didn't want to fight.
33|It's like when I was facing that old guy in the Hawaiian shirt.
33|I suppose I've ended up acting like Oshino-kun here.
33|I kind of regret it...
33|Pathetic.
33|So I guess I'll end this
33|with something Oshino-kun would never say.
33|Goodbye.
33|Black Scene
33|I was worried you were going to kiss me again,
33|but I guess you weren't.
33|Good morning. Welcome home.
33|Where were you?
33|Actually, I just went out and fought a human like a monster,
33|and a monster like a human, all for you.
33|That was kind of you. Thanks.
33|Don't overdo it.
33|Just let me. I do it because I want to.
33|I know, I know.
33|You love us.
33|Don't take it like that.
33|I hate you both.
33|Once summer break ends,
33|I'll introduce you to my girlfriend.
33|What, Onii-chan?
33|You have a girlfriend?
33|Yeah, ever since May.
33|I'm platinum mad!
33|Don't tell her anything she doesn't need to know.
33|Black Scene
33|I got way more involved than usual,
33|but there was no point in staying there forever.
33|For now, I'll go back to my room and change.
33|It's gotten quite late while I was doing all this.
33|It's time for this monster to bow out.
33|To Be Continued
34|Not ignoring her was the right decision... I think.
34|No, maybe I'm wrong.
34|Why, you ask?
34|Her body is extremely...
34|Absurdly light...
34|Correct, you could say that Senjougahara has no such thing as mass.
34|The cultural festival is coming up, but we're already seniors.
34|There's not much we can do.
34|And studying for entrance exams is more important.
34|Let's just make a list of what we can do,
34|and let everyone vote for it, okay?
34|Sure, seems pretty democratic.
34|You always have this mean tone to your voice.
34|Kinda rebellious...
34|Hanekawa Tsubasa. She's our class representative.
34|She's well disciplined and courteous.
34|She's so serious that it's scary, and all the teachers love her.
34|You could call her the representative of class representatives.
34|For reference, what did you do for the past two years' cultural festivals?
34|A haunted house and a café.
34|And as the vice class representative,
34|I'm currently discussing what we should do for the cultural festival with Hanekawa.
34|Hey, there's someone called Senjougahara in our class, right?
34|Senjougahara-san?
34|What about her?
34|Well, I was just wondering.
34|She's usually absent because she's sick, right?
34|So I was wondering if she'd come to the cultural festival.
34|Oh, and also...
34|Don't you think "Senjougahara Hitagi" is a weird and interesting name?
34|Senjougahara is a place name.
34|No, that's not what I meant...
34|I'm talking about her first name.
34|Senjougahara-san's first name is Hitagi...
34|What's so weird about that?
34|If I recall correctly, "Hitagi" is some civil engineering term.
34|You really do know everything.
34|I don't know everything, I just happen to know this.
34|How unusual...
34|Huh?
34|You actually showed interest in someone else.
34|No, it's not what you think.
34|I guess guys like frail girls.
34|My, my...
34|How sickening.
34|Frail, huh?
34|Wait, does that count as a sickness?
34|Anyway, what kind of person is Senjougahara?
34|You should know her better than I do.
34|I mean, you've been in the same class as her for three years in a row.
34|Now that you mention it...
34|Well, she's a perfect honor student.
34|She has good grades.
34|I guess.
34|But I've only been in the same class as her for a month.
34|I don't really know her that well.
34|Not to mention Golden Week was during that month.
34|Golden Week, huh?
34|What about Golden Week?
34|Nothing.
34|Just continue.
34|Let me think...
34|She doesn't talk much and it doesn't seem like she has any friends.
34|Perhaps it's because she's always sick?
34|During middle school, she was a lot livelier.
34|During middle school? You went to the same middle school as her?
34|Yeah.
34|Senjougahara-san was extremely beautiful and great at sports.
34|She was the star of the track team.
34|That's why I heard a lot of things about her.
34|What things?
34|Like I heard she's a nice person who's very sociable.
34|And her father is a big shot in a foreign corporation,
34|and she lives in a mansion.
34|Despite that, she doesn't show off.
34|Superwoman much?
34|Maybe I shouldn't say this, but....
34|Senjougahara-san...
34|What?
34|She's much prettier now than she was before.
34|Her existence is so delicate.
34|Her existence is so delicate...
34|Oh yeah, I forgot!
34|Oshino asked me to go to his place.
34|Oshino-san? Why?
34|Well, I'm kinda helping him with his work.
34|Hanekawa, can I leave the rest to you?
34|If you promise you'll make up for it, then sure.
34|I mean, it'd be bad to keep Oshino-san waiting.
34|Sorry.
34|Say hi to him for me.
34|What did you and Hanekawa-san talk about?
34|Don't move.
34|Oh, my bad.
34|I mean, you can move if you want, but it'd be very dangerous.
34|Curiosity is like a cockroach.
34|It likes to stumble upon secrets that're supposed to stay hidden.
34|It's pretty damn annoying.
34|Hey...
34|What's up?
34|Is your right cheek feeling lonely?
34|If so, just tell me.
34|I was careless.
34|I never expected...
34|...a banana peel to be there.
34|You noticed, didn't you?
34|Correct.
34|I am... weightless.
34|Well, I say that, but I'm not actually weightless.
34|According to my height and build, I should be around 45 kg.
34|But my actual weight is...
34|5 kg.
34|This happened before I entered this high school.
34|I met a crab and it took away my weight.
34|It's all right if you don't understand.
34|I'm just telling you because it'll be troublesome if you keep on sniffing around like that,
34|Araragi-kun.
34|Araragi-kun...
34|Hey, Araragi Koyomi-kun.
34|Now, what should I do in order to keep you quiet?
34|What should I do for myself?
34|What should I do in order to make you swear you won't leak a word even if your mouth gets ripped open?
34|Anyway, all I want is your silence and apathy.
34|If you'd like to promise me that,
34|then nod twice, Araragi-kun.
34|All other actions including not responding will be taken as a no,
34|and I will immediately go on the offensive.
34|I see. Thank you.
34|Oh, you didn't scream.
34|Amazing.
34|I'll spare you this time.
34|You...
34|Now then, Araragi-kun.
34|Ignore me from tomorrow on, okay?
34|Please.
34|She's the devil.
34|Oww...
34|But I'm okay.
34|This is nothing, so I'm okay.
34|Huh? Araragi-kun?
34|Hanekawa?
34|You're still here?
34|Shouldn't you be at Oshino-san's place?
34|Hanekawa, do you like bananas?
34|Huh? Well, it's not that I dislike them...
34|I mean, they're very nutritious. But if I were to choose between liking and disliking them...
34|I think I'd lean more towards liking them.
34|No matter how much you like them, don't eat them at school.
34|Huh?
34|Well, okay, you can eat them. But if you throw the peel on the stairs...
34|I'll never forgive you!
34|What are you talking about, Araragi-kun?
34|Hey, Araragi-kun!
34|Don't run in the corridors!
34|I'll tell on you!
34|I'm amazed.
34|Actually, I should really say I'm surprised.
34|I never thought you'd show resistance so fast.
34|Senjougahara.
34|All right, I got it.
34|I understand, Araragi-kun.
34|Let's go to war.
34|No, no!
34|Let's not go to war!
34|Let's not?
34|What?
34|Then what is it?
34|I was just thinking...
34|That I might be able to help you.
34|Help me?
34|Dream on. What can you do?
34|Just keeping your mouth shut and ignoring me is good enough.
34|Kindness can sometimes translate to hostility.
34|There's no...
34|...wound.
34|How did you...
34|Oshino... Oshino-san?
34|Yeah, Oshino Meme.
34|Thanks to him, I transformed back into a human from a vampire.
34|But it seems like there are a few side effects from immortality.
34|Oshino Meme?
34|His name sounds pretty moe.
34|Getting your hopes up is pointless.
34|He's some thirty year old guy.
34|I see.
34|But he was a moe character when he was small, right?
34|Don't look at someone 3D like that.
34|Wait, do you even understand what "moe" and "character" mean?
34|Those terms are basic knowledge.
34|I guess my character is what people call "tsundere", right?
34|Your character is what people call "tsundra".
34|My ass hurts. It's all numb.
34|And my skirt is wrinkled.
34|That's not my fault.
34|Don't make excuses or I'll cut it off.
34|Cut what off?
34|By the way, where's your backpack?
34|You're not holding anything.
34|All my textbooks are in my locker.
34|And there's no point in having a backpack when I keep all of my school supplies on me.
34|Oh, I see.
34|If I don't keep both of my hands free,
34|I won't be able to fight freely if something happens.
34|Let me hang on to your school supplies.
34|I'll look after it, so hand it over.
34|Oshino might be a weird guy, but I consider him to be my savior.
34|I can't let some dangerous person meet with my savior,
34|so let me look after your school supplies.
34|You waited until we got here to say that...
34|You set me up, right?
34|All right then. Please look after it.
34|You're kidding...
34|Don't get the wrong idea.
34|It's not like I'm letting my guard down for you.
34|What do you mean?
34|Listen up.
34|I have 5000 grunts. If I were to go for a minute without contacting them, they would go and attack your family.
34|Everything will be fine, don't worry.
34|You mean a minute's enough?!
34|Do you think I'm some boxer?!
34|Your two younger sisters are still in middle school, aren't they?
34|This way.
34|What? Don't think I'll thank you.
34|I get that.
34|You should be the one thanking me.
34|I don't get that.
34|I didn't want to make the injury too obvious,
34|so I purposely stapled the inside instead of the outside of your mouth.
34|That's like saying, "The wound would stand out on his face, so I'll hit his stomach."
34|It's just convenient for the assailant.
34|Well, whatever, it seems like I was just wasting effort.
34|I guess...
34|Does it hurt if I say being immortal is convenient?
34|Not anymore.
34|Oh, really?
34|Because I'm not immortal anymore.
34|It's just that my wounds heal faster.
34|Apart from that, I'm perfectly normal.
34|Araragi-kun, I'm warning you one last time.
34|What is it?
34|You might not be able to tell with my clothes on,
34|but surprisingly enough, my body isn't worth the jail time.
34|You're either too insecure,
34|or your persecution complex has gotten way out of hand.
34|My gosh.
34|Even so, there are things you should say and there are things you shouldn't.
34|She's aware?!
34|Back on topic, I can't believe that this Oshino guy lives in a building that looks like it's about to collapse.
34|Yeah, he's a pretty weird guy.
34|But he's an expert in cases like yours and mine.
34|Oh, Araragi-kun.
34|You're finally here.
34|What's up, Araragi-kun?
34|You brought a different girl again along with you today.
34|Cut it. Don't write me off as some low class character.
34|Nice to meet you, young lady.
34|I'm Oshino.
34|Nice to meet you too, I'm Senjougahara Hitagi.
34|I'm a classmate of Araragi-kun's and he told me about you.
34|Oh, I see.
34|Oshino, two years ago, this chick-
34|Don't call me "this chick".
34|Then what should I call you?
34|Senjougahara-sama.
34|Se-n-jo-u-ga-ha-ra-sa-ma.
34|I don't like the way you pronounced it.
34|Say it properly.
34|Senjougahara-chan-
34|Ouch!
34|Are you trying to blind me?!
34|No one told you to be rude.
34|What sort of equivalent exchange is this?!
34|My harsh remarks are made by transmutating 40g of copper, 25g of zinc,
34|15g of nickel, 5g of hiding my embarrassment along with 97kg of spite.
34|Isn't that nearly all spite?!
34|By the way, I was lying about "hiding my embarrassment".
34|You took out the most important ingredient!
34|Enough of that. What is that girl?
34|Oh, don't worry about her.
34|She has neither shadow nor form.
34|She has neither name nor existence. That's what she is.
34|You're wrong, Araragi-kun.
34|I gave her a name yesterday.
34|Since she helped me a lot during Golden Week.
34|Oh? She has a name now?
34|What is it?
34|Her name is Oshino Shinobu.
34|A heart under the blade.
34|The name suits her, doesn't it?
34|I let her use my surname.
34|That's great.
34|I believe I asked what exactly she is.
34|Like I said, she's nothing.
34|A ruined vampire.
34|Leftovers of a beautiful demon.
34|I say that, but it doesn't mean anything.
34|I see, so she's nothing.
34|All right then.
34|So I heard you could save me?
34|Save you?
34|I can't do that.
34|You're the only one who can save yourself, young lady.
34|There were five people who spat the exact same lines at me.
34|They were all scammers.
34|Are you the same as them, Oshino-san?
34|Well aren't you lively.
34|Did something nice happen?
34|Well, anyway, we can't get further if you don't tell me your story.
34|I'll keep it a secret, so don't worry.
34|Well, let me explain it briefly-
34|Don't worry about it, Araragi-kun.
34|I'll tell him by myself.
34|Senjougahara...
34|I can do it by myself.
34|Heavy crab.
34|Heavy crab?
34|Yeah, it's folklore from the mountains of Kyushu.
34|Depending on the location, its name varies from weighty crab to heavy stone crab.
34|Or even heavy stone god. That means crabs and gods are connected.
34|But why Kyushu?
34|The place itself doesn't matter.
34|As long as certain conditions are met, it'll appear.
34|That's all.
34|In this case, it doesn't have to be a crab.
34|There are rumors of it being a rabbit.
34|There are also rumors of it being a beautiful woman. It's not Shinobu-chan though.
34|Sounds like the patterns on the moon.
34|Well, if this young lady met a crab,
34|then it's a crab.
34|What's with that?
34|The name isn't important.
34|It is important.
34|I said it before, it might be a God rather than a crab.
34|The heavy crab was derived from the heavy stone God.
34|Well, you're a lucky one out of the unlucky bunch.
34|Why so?
34|Gods are everywhere.
34|They're everywhere, yet nowhere.
34|You can say it was both around you and not around you before you became like this.
34|This is just like Zen dialog.
34|It's Shinto. Or perhaps it's Shugendou?
34|Don't get the wrong idea, young lady.
34|You didn't become like this because of whatever.
34|It's just that your point of view changed.
34|My point of view? What are you trying to say?
34|I'm saying I can't stand you acting all victimized, young lady.
34|I'm surprised.
34|I thought you were a selfish person, but...
34|Why would you think that?
34|Humans who meet heavy crabs are usually like that.
34|You can't see it just because you want to,
34|and it's not a harmful God.
34|Not harmful?
34|It's just there and it won't appear if you don't wish for anything.
34|Well, I don't wanna delve so deep into your situation.
34|Anyway, I get it.
34|If you want to regain your weight,
34|I can help you.
34|You were referred here by Araragi-kun, after all.
34|Can you save me?
34|I'm Karen.
34|I'm Tsukihi.
34|It's time for the preview quiz!
34|Quiz!
34|"Hit and beat" refers to me, right?
34|Does it refer to Karen-chan?
34|What does this "&" stand for?
34|The question isn't hard, but it's hard to understand it.
34|Next episode, Hitagi Crab, Part 2.

35|Even though Hanekawa said Senjougahara lives in a mansion...
35|My mother was deceived by some weird cult.
35|She paid her entire fortune as tribute
35|and she racked up a large debt.
35|As a result, my parents divorced at the end of last year,
35|and I went with my dad.
35|Now I live here with him.
35|Can you save me?
35|I can't save you, but I can help you.
35|Well, please go home first.
35|Clean your body with cold water and change into some clean clothes.
35|We'll meet here again at midnight. Is that okay with you?
35|Okay.
35|But what do you want?
35|Huh?
35|Please don't play dumb with me.
35|It's not like you're volunteering to help me.
35|Well, if that makes you feel better, I'll charge a little.
35|How does 100,000 yen sound?
35|100,000 yen...
35|That's awfully different from what I got charged.
35|Really? I remember charging Class Rep-chan 100,000 yen too-
35|You asked me for five fricken' million!
35|You became a vampire, I didn't have a choice.
35|Don't blame it on vampires!
35|Can you afford it?
35|Of course.
35|I'll pay it...
35|...no matter what.
35|100,000 yen, huh?
35|I finished showering.
35|Please move or I won't be able to get my clothes.
35|Put on your damn clothes!
35|Like I said, I'm going to put them on now.
35|You should've put them on before you came out!
35|I forgot to take them in with me.
35|You should at least use a towel to cover your body!
35|No, that's what poor people do.
35|This is the first time I've seen a girl's naked body...
35|Clean clothes...
35|Do you think white would be better?
35|I don't know.
35|I only have...
35|...patterned underwear and bras.
35|I said I don't know!
35|Araragi-kun.
35|Don't tell me you had dirty thoughts after seeing me nude?
35|Even if I did, it's not my fault!
35|All right, you can turn around now.
35|Really? Seriously...
35|What do you want?!
35|What? This is just some special service to thank you for today.
35|Appreciate it.
35|I told you to appreciate it.
35|Now she's mad at me instead!
35|Telling me what you think would be the polite thing to do, wouldn't it?
35|W-What I think...
35|S-Something like "You have a great body"?
35|You're disgusting.
35|This is why you're going to be a virgin for the rest of your life.
35|For the rest of my life? What are you, a time traveler?
35|Could you not spit while you talk? Virginity is contagious.
35|How can male virginity be transmitted to a female?!
35|Wait a second.
35|This topic is based on the assumption that I'm a virgin.
35|It's true I'm being biased.
35|Good to know.
35|Could you not spit while you talk?
35|STDs from hookers are contagious.
35|Fine I admit it, I'm a virgin!
35|Don't worry, I'll keep it a secret from Hanekawa-san.
35|Why Hanekawa?
35|Isn't she the person who you have a crush on?
35|I see you two talk a lot together.
35|You're wrong, that's just because Hanekawa is very helpful.
35|"The most useless person is the most pitiful, they always have unreasonable losses."
35|That's the type of pleasant misunderstanding she has.
35|The most useless person is the most foolish. That's truly a pleasant misunderstanding.
35|No, I never said that.
35|It's written on your face.
35|It's not.
35|I thought you'd say that, so I wrote it on your face.
35|Yeah, like you could really set that up!
35|Hanekawa-san received help from Oshino-san before, right?
35|Yeah, I guess.
35|That's why I'm saying he's trustworthy.
35|It's not only me who can prove that, but Hanekawa can too.
35|I see.
35|But you see, Araragi-kun.
35|If I trust a person so easily,
35|I don't know how many times I would've been tricked.
35|That's why I can't think so optimistically no matter what.
35|You just put it on. Why are you taking it off?
35|I forgot to dry my hair.
35|Are you an idiot or what?
35|Please don't say such rude things.
35|The consequences will be severe if you hurt me.
35|You mentioned "optimistic" just then, right?
35|Did I not?
35|Perhaps.
35|But isn't being more optimistic better?
35|It's not like you're doing something bad or tricking yourself.
35|Not doing something bad, huh?
35|Don't you think so?
35|Perhaps.
35|But...
35|Perhaps I am tricking myself.
35|What?
35|Never mind.
35|Hey, Araragi-kun.
35|Can I ask you a question?
35|What does "having a pattern the same as the moon" mean?
35|Huh? What are you talking about?
35|Didn't you say that to Oshino-san?
35|Well, you see.
35|From Japan, the pattern on the moon looks like a rabbit making rice cake.
35|But in foreign countries, it looks like a crab or the side of a beauty's face.
35|Oh, really?
35|I'm surprised you know such worthless things.
35|This is first time since I was born that I've been impressed with you.
35|It's nothing, I'm just good at astronomy and space science.
35|There's no point in acting cool in front of me.
35|You probably don't know anything else apart from that.
35|Do you know about "verbal abuse"?
35|Then call the verbal abuse police.
35|You just want to show off the body that you're proud of, don't you?
35|The body that I'm proud of? I'm not that conceited.
35|I'm just not good at wearing clothes.
35|They're too heavy.
35|However, you surprisingly know quite a lot, Araragi-kun.
35|I was surprised.
35|Perhaps there might even be a brain inside your head.
35|Of course there is.
35|Of course?
35|You could say it's a miracle that a creature like yourself has a brain under that skull.
35|You must think that I'm extremely dumb, don't you?
35|How did you know?
35|You look genuinely surprised!
35|It's all because of me that Araragi-kun discovered how poorly made his brain is.
35|I can feel the responsibility.
35|Hey, wait!
35|Am I really that hopeless?
35|Academic performance rating check.
35|Mine is 74.
35|Mine is 46...
35|That would be zero if you round that.
35|Huh?!
35|You're kidding! The unit value is 6, so-
35|Wait, you rounded using the tens!
35|What did you do to my academic performance rating?!
35|I won't feel a sense of victory if we aren't 100 apart.
35|You rounded yours using the tens too...
35|I've made a decision.
35|If everything goes well,
35|I'll go to Hokkaido to eat crab.
35|Sure, good for you.
35|You're coming too.
35|Why?
35|Oh, you don't know?
35|Crabs taste very good.
35|Oshino-san, are you a priest?
35|Nope, I'm not.
35|That's what I picked for my major in university,
35|but I don't work at a shrine.
35|Because there was a lot to think about.
35|Young lady, your clothes give off a sense of honesty.
35|Splendid.
35|Just making sure. You didn't put on make-up, did you?
35|I thought it'd be better not to, so I didn't.
35|Yeah, your decision was correct.
35|Araragi-kun, you took a shower too, right?
35|Yeah, I took one at her house.
35|There shouldn't be a problem.
35|You're still as stubborn as ever.
35|Cut the pointless talk.
35|By the way, Oshino.
35|Is it really so simple to exterminate that crab thing?
35|You think too reckless, Araragi-kun.
35|Did something nice happen?
35|Shinobu-chan and the Perverted Cat attacked you and Class Rep-chan with malicious intentions,
35|but this crab is different.
35|Different?
35|Didn't I tell you? It's a God.
35|That's why we're going to pray to it instead of exterminating it.
35|Modestly pray.
35|If we pray to it, will it give back Senjougahara's... weight? Her mass?
35|Probably.
35|They're not stubborn enough to refuse the sincere requests of humans.
35|Those Gods are just a sketchy bunch.
35|Sketchy?
35|They don't really care about humans.
35|To those Gods, our age, gender, and weight are no different.
35|Hey.
35|Is that crab beside me right now?
35|Yeah, it's by your side, it's everywhere.
35|However, in order to make it descend here, there are procedures we must follow.
35|Both of you, bow down your head and look at the floor.
35|We're before an altar.
35|What is this?
35|It seems like drinking alcohol can shorten your distance with God.
35|I'm still a minor.
35|Just a little, it's not enough to get you drunk.
35|Now, let's start by relaxing.
35|This is your own spot.
35|The spot where it's only natural for you to be.
35|Okay.
35|Keep the position with your head down and close your eyes.
35|Start counting.
35|1, 2, 3,
35|4, 5, 6,
35|7, 8, 9...
35|Have you calmed down?
35|Yes.
35|Great, now answer my questions.
35|Young lady, what's your name?
35|Senjougahara Hitagi.
35|What's the school you go to?
35|Naoetsu Private High School.
35|When's your birthday?
35|July 7th.
35|Who's your favorite author?
35|Yumeno Kyuusaku.
35|Can you tell me stories about how you screwed up as a kid?
35|No, I don't want to.
35|What classical music do you like?
35|I'm not that interested in music.
35|How did you feel when you graduated elementary school?
35|I just wanted to get into middle school.
35|After all, it was just transferring from one public school to another.
35|What kind of guy did you have your first crush on?
35|I don't want to say.
35|What was the most painful memory in your life up until now?
35|What's wrong?
35|I'm asking about the most painful memory in your life.
35|My... My mother being...
35|Mother?
35|...deceived by an evil cult.
35|Is that all?
35|What do you mean?
35|Continue.
35|What happened?
35|S-Some higher up from that cult came to our house...
35|My mother brought him there...
35|What happened next?
35|It was some ritual...
35|He...
35|H-He tried to assault...
35|He tried to rape me.
35|I see.
35|But by "tried", you mean it was just an attempt, right?
35|I hit him with a spiked shoe that was next to me.
35|But my mother didn't save me...
35|And then?
35|Since the higher up was injured, my mother was...
35|Your mother was punished, right?
35|Yes.
35|But I thought about it...
35|If I didn't resist back then, at least my family wouldn't have become like this.
35|It wouldn't have become so broken.
35|Note: 思い (feelings) and 重い (weight) are both pronounced omoi.
35|Then those are your feelings.
35|No matter how heavy it is, it's something you need to shoulder.
35|You can't transfer it to someone else.
35|But I didn't-
35|Don't turn away, open your eyes and look.
35|Can you see something?
35|I-I can see it.
35|It's the same as that time.
35|It's the same as that time...
35|A huge crab.
35|I can see the crab.
35|Really? I can't see it at all.
35|What about you, Araragi-kun?
35|I can't see anything.
35|B-But I can see it clearly.
35|I can see it...
35|Really? So...
35|So isn't there something you need to say?
35|Something I need to say...
35|S-Senjougahara!
35|It's hopeless.
35|My my, what an impatient God.
35|He's just so friendly.
35|Did something nice happen?
35|H-Hey, Oshino!
35|Yeah, I know, change of plan.
35|There's no other choice.
35|Take this!
35|In the end, it's just about your mental state.
35|If you can't make a request and if words don't work,
35|there can only be war.
35|But...
35|Well, you can say the problem is solved now that I've crushed it.
35|I figured I could let it pass for now.
35|P-Pass?
35|I hate crabs with a passion.
35|They're hard to eat.
35|Wait...
35|Please wait, Oshino-san.
35|Wait?
35|Wait for what, young lady?
35|Just now, I was just surprised.
35|I'll really do it now.
35|I can do it by myself.
35|Go ahead then.
35|Give it a shot.
35|I'm sorry.
35|And also, thank you very much.
35|But this is enough.
35|Those are my feelings, my thoughts, and my memories.
35|I'll shoulder them by myself.
35|They're something that I can't lose.
35|Please...
35|Please give me back my weight.
35|Please give me back my mother...
35|Senjougahara's mother began participating in the cult when she was in fifth grade.
35|Back then, Senjougahara had a serious disease.
35|Due to her daughter's illness, her mother needed a place for her heart to be at ease.
35|And then...
35|Senjougahara barely made it out of the operation alive.
35|But because of that, her mother fell deeper into the cult.
35|Senjougahara's relationship with her mother plunged.
35|It seems like she stopped talking to her mother at the beginning of middle school.
35|And then...
35|When she was about to graduate from middle school, that happened.
35|The result was...
35|...a broken family.
35|It became a catastrophe.
35|And then, Senjougahara met it.
35|She met a crab.
35|Araragi-kun, you know, heavy crabs...
35|In other words, heavy stone gods.
35|Their name can also be read as "feelings and ties".
35|Ties of obligation, that is.
35|In other words, when Senjougahara met the crab, she cut the ties between herself and her mother.
35|It erased her thoughts about her mother as worries.
35|It stopped her from feeling.
35|And her weight was taken away from her.
35|Willingly. She tricked herself.
35|This isn't all that bad, but...
35|In this case, even though you got your feelings back,
35|your mother isn't going to come back, and your broken family can't be repaired.
35|Even she knew that. Even so.
35|Because of this, Senjougahara Hitagi wanted them back.
35|She really wanted them back.
35|Those helpless feelings about her mother.
35|Those memories and troubles.
35|Although it could just turn out like Oshino said, and nothing will change...
35|There's nothing that won't change.
35|And plus, this wasn't a waste of effort.
35|At the very least, I made a precious friend.
35|Who are you talking about?
35|You.
35|Thank you, Araragi-kun.
35|I offer you all my gratitude.
35|I apologize for what I've done to you up until now.
35|This might be shameless for me to say...
35|But I'll be very happy if we can continue getting along well together.
35|Bro, it's morning! Hey!
35|You have to wake up or else!
35|I just fell asleep...
35|Huh? So you stayed up all night.
35|Gosh!
35|You're the only one who hasn't eaten breakfast!
35|Yeah, yeah!
35|My body is heavy... It seems like I've got a fever.
35|By the way, I weigh 55 kg.
35|But...
35|Come on...
35|I see.
35|Gods really are just a sketchy bunch.
35|I'm Karen!
35|Tsukihi here!
35|It's time for the preview quiz!
35|Quiz!
35|You're a bus driver.
35|Driver.
35|So what's the name of the bus driver?
35|That's too brief!

36|Today is a national holiday, Mother's Day.
36|Whether you love or hate your mom, whether you get along with her or not,
36|you were given Mother's Day to enjoy as a Japanese person.
36|I didn't come to this park for any particular reason.
36|I arrived here by just riding my mountain bike randomly,
36|going wherever my feet carried me.
36|But, as the only one in a park on a Sunday,
36|it felt like I was the only one in the world.
36|Perhaps it's an exaggeration,
36|but it felt as if perhaps the park belonged to me.
36|As if it would be perfectly all right to never go back home.
36|I felt like that.
36|Since it's only me.
36|Since I'm alone.
36|Alone again?
36|I thought so.
36|If you're gonna be like that-!
36|If you're gonna be like that, bro!
36|Oh, my. Well, well.
36|I thought someone left a dead dog here.
36|But it turns out it's just you, Araragi-kun.
36|What? I was just saying hello.
36|It was a joke.
36|No, uh.
36|What, then?
36|Araragi-kun, you little boy.
36|Were you just fascinated by my charming street clothes?
36|A moment of bliss?
36|That may have just been a bad pun,
36|but I really was fascinated.
36|Anyway, the second kanji in "fascinating" is an amazing kanji, isn't it?
36|Don't you know?
36|The second kanji is written with the grass radical over a bath.
36|To me, its sensitivity is a step beyond the bright and happy "moe" that uses the grass radical.
36|I'm waiting for it to be introduced and used in the next generation.
36|Then we can have "maid fascination" or "cat ears fascination".
36|Things like that.
36|I was just surprised because those clothes give a completely different impression than what I saw you in before.
36|That's it.
36|I guess.
36|I guess it's because I was wearing mellower clothes then.
36|Really?
36|Speaking of which, I bought this whole outfit yesterday.
36|But I'm happy.
36|I wanted you to see these clothes first if possible, Araragi-kun.
36|Hey, if you wanted to show them to me first...
36|Well, uh...
36|That makes it sound like a stroke of luck or an honor.
36|I didn't want to show you them, Araragi-kun.
36|I wanted you to see them.
36|The nuance is completely different.
36|By the way, Araragi-kun.
36|Just what are you doing here?
36|Just a little touring.
36|I felt like going out on my bike.
36|Then I found this park, so I figured I'd take a rest.
36|How about you, Senjougahara?
36|Do you come here often?
36|This used to be my place.
36|"Your place"?
36|That's right, you said you used to live around here.
36|Well, yes.
36|But then it all changed.
36|It's not like I'm too sentimental about it, but...
36|For some reason, seeing how where I used to live has changed makes my motivation slip away.
36|Isn't it unavoidable?
36|That's right. It's unavoidable.
36|Hey, Araragi-kun.
36|You don't care if I sit next to you, do you?
36|Next to me?
36|There's something I want to discuss with you.
36|Fine.
36|Having a whole bench to myself made me feel a little uneasy.
36|Yeah.
36|Then I'll go right ahead.
36|I thought I'd try thanking you again for these recent events.
36|I don't really care about that.
36|Go thank Oshino instead.
36|That'll be more than enough.
36|I have to pay Oshino the fee.
36|I want to thank you in a different way than Oshino.
36|Well, uh. Stop thinking that you owe me something.
36|It's going to make it tough to get along with you.
36|To get along, huh?
36|Araragi-kun.
36|Can I think of you as someone dear?
36|Of course.
36|But you're not the type of person who makes friends easily, are you?
36|I was like that until last year,
36|but I had a paradigm shift over spring break.
36|How about you, Senjougahara?
36|I was like that until just recently.
36|More specifically, until I met you.
36|What's she saying?!
36|What's this situation?
36|This situation... It's like she's about to tell me she loves me.
36|What I mean to say, Araragi-kun.
36|Is that no matter what you say, I have to pay you back.
36|Once that's over,
36|we'll be able to become friends on an even footing.
36|Friends...
36|Friends!
36|So, Araragi-kun, perhaps there's something you want me to do?
36|Just this once, I'll do anything.
36|Anything?
36|Anything at all. Just this once, I'll fulfill whatever your wish is.
36|Whether it's world conquest, or eternal life, or to defeat the Saiyans that are coming to earth.
36|Are you saying you're more powerful than Shen Long?!
36|Of course.
36|She went along with it.
36|But to be honest, it's easier for me to help with something more personal.
36|After all, it's simpler.
36|Sure is.
36|I told you, anything's okay.
36|Like saying you want me to end all my sentences with "nyu" for a week.
36|Or that you want me not to wear underwear to school for a week.
36|Or that you want me to wake you up every morning for a week, wearing nothing but an apron.
36|Or that you want me to help out with colon cleansing for a week.
36|You have to have plenty of kinks.
36|You think I'm that kind of a pervert!?
36|Isn't that really rude?!
36|Well, uh, sorry,
36|but I'm not sure if I can go along with them for a lifetime.
36|No! Wrong, wrong, wrong!
36|I'm not pissed off because you think I'm less of a perv!
36|Really?
36|If I may suggest, I recommend my waking you up every morning wearing nothing but an apron.
36|Then I can cook you breakfast.
36|Isn't it a man's fantasy to watch that from behind?
36|Come on, Senjougahara.
36|If we make that deal,
36|I don't think we'll be able to think of each other as just friends after.
36|Oh my. Now that you mention it, it does seem like that.
36|That's right. Then nothing sexual.
36|But I guess I figured you wouldn't want anything sexual.
36|Oh, so you do have faith in me.
36|After all, you're a virgin.
36|She's said that before.
36|Virgins aren't picky, so it's easy on the other person.
36|Hey, Senjougahara.
36|It's not like you've done that much either.
36|What are you saying? I'm plenty experienced.
36|Really?
36|I do it all the time.
36|Um, if that were really true, Senjougahara,
36|what would you gain by telling me?
36|Understood. I'll correct myself.
36|I have no experience. I'm a virgin.
36|I mean, the only kind of girl who would talk to an unappealing virgin like you
36|are late-bloomer crazy virgins like me!
36|We've kind of gotten onto a tangent,
36|but is there anything you want to talk about?
36|To put it more simply, maybe something you're troubled by?
36|Something that I'm troubled by...
36|I don't really have a way with words, so I can't say it,
36|but I really do want to help you.
36|I guess, if I have to say it...
36|What is it?
36|Talk to me about it. If you just talk about it, it'll be easier. I guess.
36|Umm...
36|I had a fight with my little sister.
36|I can't really help you with that.
36|But I'll listen to the whole thing just in case.
36|"Just in case"...
36|So which sister did you fight with?
36|I mean, you do have two of them.
36|You know?
36|The older of the two.
36|But really, it's a problem with both of them.
36|No matter when, where, or what they're doing, they're always asking the five Ws and one H.
36|Because they hang out together so much.
36|Well, they are the Tsuganoki Second Junior High Fire Sisters.
36|You even know their nickname?
36|Hey, today's Mother's Day, right?
36|That's right, it is.
36|They're both attached to Mom.
36|And Mom fusses over them like a mother cat over kittens.
36|So...
36|I see.
36|For a bad son, it's like your own house isn't your home today on Mother's Day.
36|Pretty much.
36|I got up early in the morning so I could sneak out of the house.
36|My sister caught me getting on my bike.
36|And we argued.
36|Argued?
36|She said that, as my sister, she wanted me to stay and celebrate Mother's Day together.
36|But, hey, I can't do that.
36|If you're gonna be like that, bro-!
36|If you're like that, no matter how much time passes-
36|So, basically.
36|I can't even celebrate on Mother's Day,
36|and get pissed off at what my four years younger sister says.
36|That's what I call smallness as a human being,
36|No matter how much I'm irritated by it, I can't do anything about it.
36|That's a complex issue.
36|It's not complex, just stunted.
36|Because as a human being I'm small, or something.
36|But even still, when I think that I'm gonna have to apologize to my sister,
36|I definitely don't wanna go home.
36|You don't want to go home?
36|I'm sorry, but there's nothing I'm capable of doing about your smallness as a human being.
36|Come on, at least put some effort in.
36|Of course, but there's nothing I'm capable of doing about your smallness as a human being.
36|I'm pretty boring, huh.
36|My worries are this tiny.
36|I hate it.
36|Tiny.
36|You can call it dull if you want.
36|Like the dullness of only ever pulling "a little luck" at omikuji.
36|You shouldn't deny your charm, Araragi-kun.
36|Charm? My charm is like only ever pulling "a little luck"?!
36|I was joking.
36|And Araragi-kun, your dullness isn't like pulling "a little luck".
36|Do you want to say it's like pulling "bad luck"?
36|Oh my. Isn't that amazing?
36|Or shall I say, something great?
36|Araragi-kun, your dullness...
36|It's like pulling "great luck", but when you read the contents, it's not all that good.
36|It's that kind of dullness.
36|Ouch.
36|But little sisters are there to be loved.
36|We do nothing but fight.
36|They must be eyesores, rather than cute.
36|It's not like they're eyesores either!
36|Or maybe you're someone who shows your love in reverse.
36|I didn't expect you to be into incest.
36|That's not it.
36|Liking little sisters is a fantasy of guys who don't have any.
36|So you're not into incest.
36|You're not interested in your real little sisters.
36|Like I ever would be!
36|That's right. Araragi-kun, you look like you'd be into soro.
36|Into soro?
36|An abbreviation of "sororate marriage".
36|It's like levirate marriage, but for sisters.
36|It's where, when your wife dies, you marry her sister.
36|Why do you think I'd do that sororate thing?
36|For you, Araragi-kun, it'd be her little sister rather than her big sister.
36|First your wife's sister would call you "big bro", and then you'd marry her.
36|Even after marrying, she'd still call you "big bro".
36|Thus, by the proper meaning, you'd become a real-
36|Doesn't that mean I'd have killed my first wife?!
36|So, you're into soro.
36|Please, just say I'm into incest!
36|But you said you wouldn't want your real sister.
36|I wouldn't want my sister-in-law either!
36|Then what if you came to like someone you took as a lover out of a sense of duty?
36|That's-!
36|You can get a lover out of duty?
36|You really are small to be shocked by mild jokes like this.
36|Your words aren't mild!
36|I was testing you.
36|Why am I being tested?
36|Hey, wait, you weren't being serious?!
36|When I get serious, I transform.
36|Transform?!
36|Awesome, I wanna see!
36|That's a big reaction for a small human being.
36|But no matter how small of a human being you are, I'm never gonna desert you.
36|I'll follow along with your smallness as a human being.
36|That's a pretty strange way of putting it.
36|So is there anything troubling you besides your smallness as a human?
36|What kind of abuse am I in for now?
36|You have a wonderfully large tolerance.
36|Don't overdo it with the flattery!
36|Isn't there anything?
36|Maybe helping you study.
36|I've given up on that.
36|As long as I graduate, I'm fine.
36|So, helping you graduate.
36|I can do that fine myself!
36|So you want to do it yourself?
36|Are you trying to pick a fight?
36|Well, I guess.
36|Or maybe you want a girlfriend.
36|If I say I do...
36|What would you do?
36|You can have a girlfriend.
36|That's all.
36|No, not really.
36|Right.
36|Get me a can of juice or something next time.
36|Do that and we're even.
36|Okay.
36|You're unselfish, aren't you.
36|You really do have large tolerance.
36|I saw that girl before.
36|Hey, Senjougahara.
36|How do you pronounce what's written on that grade-schooler's backpack?
36|I can't see.
36|You can't normally read at this range?
36|Uh, there's single digit kanji numbers, eight and nine, and a temple.
36|So "Hachi-kyu-dera" all in a row.
36|That's Hachikuji, isn't it?
36|Hachikuji?
36|So it's Hachikuji Mayoi?
36|No matter how I look at it, she isn't the type that likes kids.
36|Hey, mind waiting here for a minute?
36|Okay, but where are you going?
36|I'm gonna go talk to that grade-schooler.
36|Give it a rest.
36|You're just gonna get shot down.
36|Damn, she really has no problem being a bitch.
36|Hey, what's up?
36|You lost?
36|Don't talk to me.
36|I hate you.
36|What's up?
36|Did something happen?
36|I got shot down. In flames.
36|I'm gonna try again!
36|But what are you doing, and where are you going?
36|Watch and you'll see!
36|Hey, you.
36|Are you lost?
36|Where do you want to go?
36|Why don't you let me see that note?
36|Okay?
36|Hey...
36|What, did something happen?
36|She ignored me...
36|I got shunned by a grade-school girl.
36|This time I'm really going for it!
36|I don't understand what you're doing or what you want to do.
36|Leave me alone!
36|What are you doing?!
36|So I've finally got your attention.
36|You can get anyone's attention by smacking them from behind!
36|Well, you look troubled, so I thought I could help you out.
36|There's nothing that someone who'd smack a grade schooler in the head could ever help with!
36|Nothing at all!
36|Well, I'm sorry.
36|Umm... My name is Araragi Koyomi.
36|Koyomi?
36|That sounds like a girl's name.
36|Eww, it's girly!
36|Stay away from me!
36|So, what's your name?
36|I'm Hachikuji Mayoi.
36|My name is Hachikuji Mayoi!
36|It's the precious name that Mom and Dad gave me!
36|Anyway, stop talking to me!
36|I hate you!
36|Why? I'm not going to hurt you anymore.
36|I'm the most harmless man in town! I wouldn't hurt man or beast!
36|Understood. I'll let down my guard.
36|Thanks.
36|So, Mr. Man-Beast.
36|Mr. Man-Beast?!
36|Who the hell are you talking about?!
36|You yelled at me! You're scary!
36|I'm sorry for yelling.
36|But "Mr. Man-Beast" is mean!
36|Anyone would yell!
36|Then what should I call you?
36|Why not just my name?
36|Okay, Araragi-san.
36|By name is great! The best!
36|I hate you, Araragi-san.
36|Hurry up and go somewhere else!
36|Come on, aren't you lost?
36|I'm perfectly fine in this situation!
36|Stop being so stubborn!
36|I'm not stubborn at all!
36|You are!
36|Eat this!
36|I got caught!
36|What an idiot.
36|A grade-schooler picking a fight with a high-schooler!
36|There stood a high school boy who had seriously taken on a grade-school girl, seriously fought her,
36|seriously won with a judo throw, and seriously felt proud of himself.
36|Wait, that's me.
36|Araragi-kun.
36|Let me explain myself.
36|Go right ahead.
36|Well, we should let bygones be bygones.
36|She looks like she's lost.
36|I was thinking we could help.
36|Really?
36|Oh, I see.
36|I understand the situation.
36|Oh, that's right, Senjougahara.
36|If I asked about an address around here, you'd kinda know it, right?
36|Well.
36|I guess as much as anyone.
36|Hey, Hachikuji.
36|Why don't you show this girl the note you were carrying before?
36|I had a dream that I was abused by a heinous high school boy.
36|Must've been a false dream.
36|I see. A false dream.
36|What's wrong? Go ahead and take it.
36|For some reason, I don't even want to touch you.
36|It's just to take a note!
36|I don't want to touch anything you've touched.
36|Fine, I get it.
36|How about I read it to you?
36|Umm...
36|You know where it is?
36|Yeah, I know that address.
36|That's great.
36|I can't pinpoint it, but if we head over there, I'll be able to get it by feeling.
36|So, shall we go?
36|Let's go, Hachikuji!
36|Where to?
36|Like I said, the address on this note.
36|That girl should know where it is. We'll guide you there.
36|Isn't that great?
36|You'll guide me there?
36|Aren't you lost?
36|Yeah, I'm lost.
36|I'm a lost snail.
36|Snail?
36|No, I...
36|It's nothing!
36|I'm Karen!
36|I'm Tsukihi!
36|Time for the preview quiz!

36|If you're talking about twin stars in the Zodiac-
36|You must be talking about Gemini!
36|No, Pisces is twins.
36|Pisces!
36|Next episode, Mayoi Snail, part 2.
36|Well, maybe they aren't twins.

36|A dark mood, like the
36|waves, washes over me.
36|As I look at the sky,
36|my pettiness still
36|disgusts me after so long
36|even though I've calmed down quite a bit.
36|Is this feeling what
36|they call self-loathing?
36|I am not the type to usually concern myself with such things. In fact, the word "worry" doesn't apply to me.
36|But occasionally, yes. On days like
36|5/10 which are dedicated to events,
36|I will typically get in that kind of "condition" for some reason.
36|A special situation.
36|A peculiar setup.
36|I am particularly vulnerable to such things.
36|I fail to
36|calm down.
36|Instead, I flee.
36|Yes, day-to-day
36|life is the best.
36|Be tomorrow already.
36|Follow
36|Due to that strange condition- The episode about the snail followed. Turned the other way, perhaps the episode would not have occurred were I not in that condition.

37|Lost cow.
37|It's gotta be "lost cow".
37|The kanji for "cow" is part of how you write "snail", right?
37|Take the "whirl" out of "whirlpool", replace the radical for "water" with the one for "bug", then follow it with "cow".
37|And you get "snail".
37|There's a large numbers of oddities that lead humans astray.
37|But if it's that type and she calls it a snail, it has to be a lost cow.
37|It was right here.
37|The house I lived in was right here.
37|"House"... That's a street.
37|Urban renewal, huh.
37|And to think that it's been less than a year.
37|We sold it, so I didn't really expect it to still be here
37|But it still leaves me feeling pretty blue.
37|Yeah, I guess.
37|I'm wasting your time crying over spilt milk.
37|Let's go, Araragi-kun.
37|You okay?
37|I'm fine.
37|Oh, okay.
37|Let's go, Hachikuji.
37|Come on, Hachikuji, back off a little. You're making it hard to walk.
37|Come on, say something. Don't just stand there.
37|It's not like I'm firmly attached to your leg!
37|You're horrible! I'm telling the PTA on you!
37|The PTA?
37|The PTA is an amazing organization!
37|Araragi-san, you're just an underage civilian with no authority!
37|They'll lay you flat with a fingertip!
37|With just a fingertip? Sounds scary.
37|By the way, Hachikuji, what does PTA stand for?
37|Well, umm...
37|PTA is an abbreviation for "Parent-Teacher Association".
37|It means a group formed between parents and teachers.
37|It's also an abbreviation for the medical term "percutaneous transluminal angioplasty".
37|I don't think that's what you need, so it must be Parent-Teacher Association.
37|You know everything, don't you, Senjougahara?
37|It seems that way because you're unlearned and incapable.
37|I don't mind being called unlearned, it has a nice ring to it.
37|But isn't it uncalled for to say I'm incapable over that?
37|Is it? Then I'll call you miserable instead.
37|By the way, Hachikuji.
37|What, Araragi-san?
37|Just what's at this address?
37|I'm not talking! I plead the Fifth!
37|If you don't tell me, I ain't gonna take you there.
37|It's not like I asked you to! I can go alone!
37|But you're lost, aren't you?
37|So what?!
37|Well... Uh, Hachikuji?
37|For future reference, it's best to ask someone for help when that happens.
37|Maybe I'd do that if I was like you and didn't believe in myself.
37|You can ask people for things until you feel satisfied.
37|But I feel no need to do that.
37|For me, this is just like using an everyday vending machine!
37|Sale at a fixed price, huh.
37|Understood, young lady..
37|Please, inform me if there is anything I should know about this address.
37|You don't sound very sincere.
37|That would've been good enough to coax the truth out of either of my sisters.
37|I can't treat Hachikuji like she's just a stupid kid.
37|Man, what do I do.
37|Young lady, I'll give you an allowance.
37|I'll tell you anything!
37|She's just a stupid kid.
37|Someone named Tsunade-san lives there.
37|How do you know them?
37|She's a relative.
37|Shouldn't you be at home showing some respect for your family on Mother's Day?
37|If you're gonna be like that, bro-!
37|If you're gonna be like that, no matter how much time passes-
37|I don't wanna hear that from you.
37|Just what do you know about me?!
37|It's just a feeling.
37|You've been wasting time on a park bench all Sunday.
37|That's nothing a decent person would do.
37|I was just-
37|I was touring.
37|Touring? Awesome!
37|Well, it was just on a bike.
37|Really? Touring has to be on a motorcycle.
37|What a pity.
37|School rules say that I can't get a license.
37|Anyway, motorcycles are pretty dangerous.
37|I'd rather have a car.
37|Really?
37|But if you do it that way, you're fouring.
37|She's making a pretty funny mistake about what "touring" means.
37|But the roads here are really complex.
37|I can't believe you wanted to come here by yourself.
37|It's not my first time or anything.
37|Really? Then why are you lost?
37|It's just been a while.
37|Speaking of which, Arararagi-san-
37|That's one too many!
37|Sorry, I stuttered.
37|Stop stuttering and making things sound bad.
37|I can't help it!
37|Everyone stutters.
37|Or have you never stuttered in your life?
37|I can't say I haven't.
37|But I almost never do it with people's names.
37|Then.
37|Say "bus gas explosion" three times.
37|That's not someone's name.
37|No, it is! I have like three friends named that!
37|So if anything, it's a common name!
37|Bus gas explosion bus gas explosion bus gas explosion!
37|What animal eats dreams?
37|The tapir?
37|Bzzzt, wrong answer.
37|The animal that eats dreams is...
37|Mankind.
37|That's not very clever!
37|Hey, Araragi-kun.
37|Can you give me the address again?
37|Fine, uhh.
37|Seems like we went a little too far.
37|Really?
37|If you want to blame me, go ahead and do it.
37|No, there's nothing to blame you for.
37|I see.
37|Why are you so scared of Senjougahara?
37|I feel like she hates me.
37|It feels like she thinks I'm in the way and she wants me to disappear.
37|I don't really think it's that extreme.
37|Hey, Senjougahara.
37|What?
37|Do you hate kids?
37|I hate them. I loathe them.
37|I'd like it if they all died.
37|I don't understand how to connect with them.
37|It must have been back in middle school.
37|I went shopping at a department store, and ran into a kid who must have been around seven.
37|And the kid started crying?
37|No, that's not it.
37|Then I said to the seven-year-old:
37|"Are you okay? Are you hurt at all? I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."
37|Not knowing what to do with a kid, I lost my head.
37|But because of that, because I handled it so poorly...
37|It left me shocked.
37|From then on, whether they're human or not, I've hated kids.
37|Anyway, Araragi-kun.
37|What?
37|I think we've gone too far again.
37|The address?
37|Come on, this has happened twice now.
37|If you want to blame me, you can keep on blaming me.
37|There's still nothing to blame you for.
37|Wait, huh.
37|Senjougahara, isn't that line a little different from before?
37|Huh, I guess.
37|What's up with that?
37|Oh, that's right. You mentioned urban renewal. Maybe it's because of that?
37|No, that's not it.
37|It's not like the old roads are completely gone.
37|I'm not actually lost.
37|What are you doing?
37|I think I'm gonna try using my GPS.
37|What is it?
37|It suddenly went out of range.
37|This is...
37|I guess it's impossible.
37|Because we can't get there no matter how many times we try.
37|Hachikuji?
37|I'll never find my way there.
37|I'll never make it to where mommy is.
37|Because I'm a lost snail.
37|Unable to reach our destination no matter what,
37|we consulted Oshino.
37|Do you know where it is? Maybe I should go.
37|It doesn't make me happy that you're worried
37|about my memory being as poor as yours.
37|If anything, it's enough to make me sad.
37|I see.
37|And I mean...
37|Don't leave me alone with some kid.
37|Based on my conversation with Senjougahara, it seems like she has her guard up again.
37|You mentioned your mom earlier, right?
37|Didn't you say Tsunade was a relative?
37|Hachikuji-chan, I'll buy you ice cream later, so won't you come a little closer?
37|Okay!
37|So, about before. About your mom.
37|Well, mommy is a relative, right?
37|Well, I guess.
37|And even if I call her mommy, it's sad because she's not mommy anymore.
37|Tsunade was my last name until third grade.
37|When daddy took me, I changed it to Hachikuji.
37|Oh man, and to think I told you to go visit your mom...
37|Naw, I'm not going just because it's Mother's Day.
37|I can go to mommy's whenever I want.
37|I see.
37|But no matter how much I search, I never make it there.
37|And then you met the snail?
37|I don't know if we met, but...
37|You must have had a lot of trouble.
37|Owww! What the hell are you doing, you brat!
37|Ow! Ow! Ow, oww!
37|No, it's nothing to laugh about.
37|From the second time on, victory is just hollow.
37|There stood a nihilistic high school boy who,
37|for the second time, smacked around a grade school girl until she blacked out.
37|By which I mean me.
37|You look scary, Araragi-kun.
37|Hanekawa?
37|Now you look surprised.
37|Well, I guess that's an improvement.
37|What's up? Why are you here?
37|I'm just killing a little time.
37|Oh really?
37|I'm killing time too.
37|I don't like staying at home, so I go out for walks on Sunday.
37|I think you're being too anxious.
37|Oh, by the way, Araragi. Is that girl your little sister?
37|Um, she's a kid who got lost.
37|Her name is Hachikuji Mayoi.
37|Hachikuji? That's pretty common in Kansai.
37|Now that I think of it, wasn't the temple in "Shinonome Monogatari"...
37|No, wait, that was written differently.
37|You know everything, don't you.
37|I don't know everything, I just happen to know this.
37|Hi there, Mayoi-chan.
37|I'm this guy's friend, Hanekawa Tsubasa.
37|Don't talk to me!
37|I hate you!
37|Oh my, I did something she hates.
37|There, there.
37|You're so cute, Mayoi-chan! I just want to eat you up!
37|But you shouldn't suddenly bite his hand, okay?
37|Come on, say sorry.
37|I-I'm sorry, Araragi-san.
37|And Araragi-kun, you shouldn't do that.
37|By "that", you mean... get violent, huh.
37|Of course, you shouldn't be violent.
37|And if you're going to spank a child, you need to tell them why so they understand.
37|Talking to you is really like studying.
37|So she's lost? Around here? If you'd like, I can show you around.
37|Nah, I sent Senjougahara to find someone.
37|Oh, you were with her?
37|You were asking me a lot about her before, weren't you.
37|Oh, that's it! That's how it is!
37|Man, you can fantasize about those things even better than yaoi fangirls.
37|Yaoi? What's that?
37|It stands for "no climax, no conclusion, deep meaning".
37|That sounds like a lie. I'll check it out later.
37|You're so serious.
37|Anyway, I'll just be in the way, so I'll get going now.
37|Sorry to bother you. Say hi to Senjougahara-san for me.
37|Look, that's a misunderstanding!
37|Oh, that's right, Hanekawa. Can I ask you something?
37|Do you know where someone named Tsunade-san lives around here?
37|Tsunade-san?
37|Umm...
37|I don't.
37|There's something even you don't know?
37|Didn't I tell you? I only know what I know.
37|Anything else, not at all.
37|Oh, right.
37|Sorry I couldn't live up to your expectations.
37|No problem.
37|Okay, bye-bye for real.
37|Sunday, May 14th, at 14:15:30.
37|The moment I got Senjougahara's phone number.
37|Oh man, she's screwing up my Sunday morning slacking.
37|Tsundere-chan's such a mean girl.
37|Tsundere-chan?
37|Oh, you mean Senjougahara.
37|You sure have been running into a lot of oddities, Araragi-kun.
37|I'm not the one who met it.
37|Really?
37|The one who met it is a girl named Hachikuji Mayoi.
37|Oh, Hachikuji Mayoi?
37|Oh, that's how it is? I see, I see.
37|If you say Hachikuji, you have to think of the fifth paragraph of "Shinonome Monogatari".
37|Hanekawa said the same thing.
37|Huh? What?
37|What is it, Oshino?
37|You're so unresourceful.
37|What're you talking about now?
37|Making Tsundere-chan take responsibility for this.
37|Well, I'm sorry for dragging Senjougahara into this.
37|Man, I didn't mean it like that.
37|Aren't you being a bit optimistic thinking you can keep solving these oddities between you, her, and Class Rep-chan?
37|That's not what I'm trying to do.
37|And I can't normally be by your side when you encounter oddities.
37|And it's inconceivable that you could solve an incident over the phone.
37|Well, I thought it'd be nothing.
37|And I don't admire you sending a girl your age alone to the place where a weird guy lives.
37|But you're not gonna do anything, are you?
37|I'm happy you trust me that much, but she doesn't.
37|I won't do anything! I won't do anything at all! Put down the stapler, Tsundere-chan!
37|Stapler?
37|That scared me.
37|Tsundere-chan is pretty scary.
37|Well, uh.
37|I suck at the phone. It's hard to talk about.
37|Hard to talk about... You mean...
37|All right, we'll do this.
37|I'll tell Tsundere-chan how to handle the lost cow.
37|You hang out there for a little bit, Araragi-kun.
37|Handle?
37|Is it okay to send the message through a person?
37|Uh... There won't be a ritual required like there was for Senjougahara?
37|Nope. Snails aren't as troublesome as crabs.
37|After all, it's not a god, more like a spirit or ghost.
37|Spirit?
37|Well, Araragi-kun, you know.
37|The Shikoku Pilgrimage, and the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage.
37|Yeah, of course I know those.
37|Hachikuji is one of those too.
37|But, you see, you can read "Hachiku" as "Yaku".
37|So it can become misfortune.
37|Hachikuji was abandoned as that interpretation spread.
37|So, now that you've been given the details and understand the history,
37|what do you think when you look at the name Hachikuji Mayoi?
37|Normally you'd think it's an inconvenient name to have because of how much meaning it seems to carry.
37|How much meaning it seems to have?
37|It would've been better if you had felt that at the beginning.
37|What would have been better about that?
37|All right, I'm gonna tell Tsundere-chan the details.
37|I don't know if she'll tell you exactly what I said, but...
37|What does he mean?
37|Anyway, Hachikuji, looks like something or other is going to happen.
37|That conversation didn't give me the impression that anything was going to happen at all.
37|Anyway, Araragi-san.
37|What?
37|I'm hungry.
37|I'm Karen!
37|I'm Tsukihi!
37|All right, time for the preview quiz!
37|Quiz!
37|If you mention catering-
37|Delivery!
37|It's like a cell phone!
37|You're not supposed to get catering on the train!
37|You're not supposed to!
37|Next time! Mayoi Snail, part 3!
37|You can watch while catering, can't you?
37|1seg, I guess.
37|Here right, next left, I can't go anywhere from here
37|Right and left, rift and leght
37|Ah, don't put your hands or feet out the window!

37|Sometimes there's something like rain

37|Let's go back together, hand in hand
37|Let's go back home together

37|Even if it's roundabout, it's not a detour
37|Ending
37|Deneb, Altair, and Vega
37|That's the Summer Triangle you pointed at
37|I remember that when I look up at the sky
37|I finally found Vega
37|But where are you, Altair?
37|You'll be alone like this
37|I looked up from the pitch dark world
37|It's like the night sky is filled with raining stars
37|I wonder when I started to chase after you
37|Please, no matter what
37|Don't be surprised
37|Listen to these feelings

37|Here, gradually, is the story of spring break.
37|It was
37|spring break.
37|I was assaulted by a vampire.
37|By a
37|beautiful beast.
37|I was assaulted--By a beast beautiful enough to chill one's blood. All the blood in my body--was wrung out.
37|As a result,
37|I became a vampire.
37|The one who rescued me from that hell was an older guy who was passing by, Oshino Meme.
37|And I became
37|human again.
37|Well, it's not that big of a deal.
37|And it's nothing
37|all that wonderful.
37|It's over and done with.
37|The only remaining problem is that, if I continue to have my blood drunk monthly,
37|I have superhuman vision.
37|Since that's more like a trait,
37|I don't mind facing it for the rest of my life.
37|And--
37|I'm still lucky. After all, it all happened during spring break.
37|For example,
37|Senjougahara was different.
37|For two years, she held something inconvenient within her. An inconvenience that obstructed most of her free will.
37|Two years of that hell--I wonder how it felt.
37|Perhaps that's why Senjougahara uncharacteristically felt such a debt to me, or perhaps she had to--
37|Leaving the inconvenience in her body aside... The fact that she was able to get rid of the inconvenience in her heart was, perhaps, a very difficult result to obtain.

38|Anyway, Araragi-san.
38|What?
38|I'm hungry.
38|Then why don't we get something to eat somewhere when Senjougahara gets back?
38|Do you have a favorite food?
38|As long as it's food, I like it.
38|Araragi-san, your hand was pretty tasty.
38|My hand isn't food.
38|Stop being so humble. It really was tasty.
38|You did get a little taste of my flesh, so I'm not sure you're kidding.
38|Hachikuji, I don't really get it, but you wanna go see your mom, right?
38|Isn't it normal for a child to want to go see their mommy?
38|Am I wrong?
38|Well, I guess you're right.
38|Araragi-san, you live with your parents, right?
38|That's why you don't get it.
38|If you didn't live with them, you'd really want to go see them.
38|I guess it's like that.
38|From how you've been talking, I get the impression that you don't like your parents.
38|It's not really like that, I just-
38|I was a good boy up until middle school.
38|I didn't get all rebellious for no reason.
38|I was thankful to them for raising me.
38|Impressive.
38|But in high school, I couldn't keep up with studying.
38|And therefore, the good-boy image I had up until then backfired.
38|There was a kind of awkwardness I couldn't really put into words.
38|Bro, if you're gonna be like that-!
38|"If I'm gonna be like that, no matter how much time passes, I'll never grow up."
38|Like I'll never grow up, so I'll always be a kid.
38|A kid? Then you're just like me.
38|I don't think I'm like you.
38|I think she meant that no matter how much my body grows, what's inside wouldn't keep up.
38|Araragi-san, I'm one of the better-developed in my class.
38|Well, your chest was pretty respectable.
38|You touched me there?! When did you touch it?!
38|Um, when we fought.
38|You stole my first touch!
38|First touch?
38|I had my first touch before my first kiss!
38|I'm such a dirty girl!
38|Oh, that's right, Hachikuji-chan. I forgot all about this.
38|Just like I promised, here's your allowance.
38|Now's a horrible time for that!
38|Here!
38|Good girl!
38|Araragi-san, you don't look like you're properly reflecting on your actions!
38|After touching a girl's delicate chest, you should say something!
38|Thanks?
38|Wrong! I'm telling you to apologize!
38|Anyway, isn't it okay?
38|It's not like you lost anything.
38|If anything, rubbing them makes them grow.
38|What, you've been hiding behind that superstition in order to rub other womens' chests?
38|You're horrible.
38|Unfortunately, I haven't had that opportunity.
38|You're a virgin, aren't you?
38|That's really, really dangerous!
38|A virgin touched me! He dirtied me!
38|It doesn't matter who touches you!
38|The guilt that had just started to sprout is fading away!
38|Are you rabid or something?!
38|If you're gonna be like this, I'm gonna grope you until you don't care about "firsts" or "kisses"!
38|There stood a high school boy who, forgetting himself,
38|forcefully sexually harassed an elementary school girl with all his might.
38|But I at least want to believe that wasn't me.
38|I'm sorry.
38|Don't worry about it.
38|I should be the one apologizing.
38|Hey, Hachikuji. You're a pretty experienced fighter.
38|I do it plenty at school.
38|You too, Araragi-san!
38|I fight like that with my sisters all the time.
38|Well, fights like that end when one side apologizes.
38|Is something wrong, Ararararagi-san?
38|This time you had two too many "ra"s.
38|Sorry, I stuttered.
38|No, you did it on purpose.
38|I stuttered.
38|Wasn't it on purpose?!
38|I couldn't help it. Everyone stutters from time to time.
38|Or have you never stuttered in your whole life, Araragi-san?
38|I can't say that I haven't, but I don't often do it with people's names.
38|Very well.
38|Say "namamumi namamome namamamamo" three times.
38|Not like you can say it.
38|Saying namamome is icky!
38|You're the one who thought of it.
38|Saying namamamo is icky too!
38|I don't get what's so icky about them.
38|Well, isn't namamamamo harder to say intentionally?
38|Namamamama!
38|So, what's wrong, Araragi-san?
38|Nothing.
38|I just got a bit melancholic contemplating how to apologize to my sister.
38|Apologize for what, rubbing her chest?
38|Like I'd rub my sister's chest.
38|I argued with her while leaving home today.
38|My mommy and daddy fought a lot too.
38|Not physically or anything, just argued.
38|As their only daughter, I'm not sure I should say this...
38|They seemed like they were a loving couple.
38|But I never saw them get along.
38|They didn't do anything but fight.
38|You love your mom, don't you?
38|Yeah, I love her.
38|I love daddy too, of course.
38|Mommy and daddy fought. And because of that, they broke up.
38|But I really love both of them.
38|I see.
38|That... That's why I'm so uneasy.
38|It seems like daddy really started to hate mommy,
38|so he wouldn't let me see her.
38|Like I'd eventually forget all about her.
38|Like if I couldn't go see her, I'd stop loving her.
38|It made me really uneasy.
38|You smell like another woman.
38|Hey, Senjougahara.
38|The smell of this shampoo...
38|Hanekawa-san, isn't it.
38|You can tell?!
38|To a degree.
38|Think of it like how you can tell women apart by the shape of their hips.
38|I don't recall saying that I have that special power!
38|Oh, you can't?
38|Don't react like you're surprised!
38|"You've got nice solid childbearing hips,
38|so I think you're sure to have healthy babies.
38|Ehehehehe."
38|Didn't you tell me that just recently?
38|That just makes me sound like a perv!
38|So Hanekawa-san did come here.
38|Well, she came, but she already left.
38|She just wandered by.
38|So, Oshino told you something, right, Senjougahara?
38|Araragi-kun, I have to apologize to you.
38|Oshino-san told me so.
38|You have to apologize for something?
38|Different conclusions are reached when one fact is looked at from two separate points of view.
38|When that happens, there's essentially no way to judge which point of view is correct.
38|There's no way to prove that one's own conclusion is correct.
38|But for that exact reason, it's also wrong to decide that you're wrong.
38|He really says things that see right through you.
38|I hate it.
38|What are you saying?
38|Or is it Oshino rather than you?
38|It doesn't seem like that has much to do with this situation.
38|The method for release from a snail - from a lost cow - is very simple, Araragi-kun.
38|You strayed because you're with a snail.
38|Separate you from the snail, and you won't get lost... Is what he said.
38|They follow them astray?
38|In the case of snails, it's like the targeted person is being drawn to the oddity.
38|So if you get away from the snail, that should be enough.
38|No, it's not me, it's Hachikuji.
38|Isn't that strange?!
38|Hachikuji isn't being led away by a snail-
38|There's no way she wants that!
38|That's why I have to apologize to you, Araragi-kun.
38|But let me explain myself.
38|I meant no harm, and I didn't do it on purpose.
38|I'm sure I was wrong.
38|Senjougahara...
38|But it seemed like that.
38|For over two years, I wasn't normal.
38|So whenever something happened, I had to think that it was because I was wrong.
38|Hey, Senjougahara.
38|Hachikuji-chan, huh.
38|To summarize, Araragi-kun.
38|The reason why you feel awkward on Mother's Day, why you fought with your sister, and why you don't want to go home...
38|...is her.
38|I can't see her.
38|It happened about ten years ago.
38|In a certain place, a certain husband and wife decided to end their relationship.
38|The couple's only daughter was taken by the father.
38|All memories fade.
38|All memories decay.
38|As time passed, that only daughter was shocked.
38|She could no longer remember her mother's face.
38|When she looked at a photograph of her mother, she could no longer tell if it was really her mother's face.
38|So, that year, the only daughter decided to go visit her mother on Mother's Day.
38|But... she didn't arrive.
38|She didn't arrive at her mother's house.
38|Why? Why?
38|Really, why?
38|Even though the crossing light really said walk...
38|That only daughter... was me.
38|And since then, you've been wandering?
38|"Those who do not reach their destinations will interfere with the return of others."
38|A wandering pilgrimage...
38|Thus, Hachikuji.
38|But-!
38|You really can't see Hachikuji?!
38|I can't see her, or hear her speak.
38|But you normally-!
38|I can't see that kind of thing.
38|All I saw was you arguing with yourself in front of that sign. Then at the end, you mimed a fight.
38|I didn't understand what you were doing at all.
38|Then why didn't you tell me?
38|Because I couldn't say it.
38|I just couldn't say it.
38|If something like that happens, and you can see something I can't,
38|I'm the one who's strange for not being able to see it.
38|Is what I would normally think.
38|I see.
38|Senjougahara didn't want to think she'd become strange again.
38|Didn't want to think she'd become strange.
38|Didn't want to make me think she'd become strange again.
38|So she pretended to be able to see Hachikuji even though she couldn't.
38|I see.
38|I'm the one who met a snail.
38|Oshino-san said this, Araragi-kun.
38|"The condition for meeting a lost cow is a desire not to return home."
38|But everyone thinks that sometimes.
38|Everyone's situation at home is like that sometimes.
38|She was like that too. Caught up in the strain and discord of her household.
38|But that's exactly why the countermeasures for a lost cow are so simple.
38|Like I said in the beginning, just don't follow it, separate from it.
38|That's all it takes.
38|It's not that malignant or that powerful of an oddity.
38|There's no great harm.
38|That's what he said. So...
38|"So..." So what, Senjougahara?
38|What I wanted to hear was just how to get her - Hachikuji - to her mother's.
38|Don't you understand, Araragi?
38|She isn't there.
38|She's not there, she's not anywhere.
38|Hachikuji... Hachikuji Mayoi-chan.
38|She's...
38|Already dead.
38|So it's not like she was possessed by an oddity.
38|She is the oddity.
38|So what?
38|It hurts, Araragi-san.
38|It's just like she - Senjougahara-san - says, Araragi-san.
38|I... I'm...
38|Shut up!
38|You couldn't hear her, could you, Senjougahara?
38|Right off the bat, she was saying horrible things to Hanekawa and I.
38|Don't talk to me. I hate you.
38|Don't you understand, Senjougahara?
38|Don't you understand how she felt?
38|Having to say those kinds of things to everyone she met to keep them from following her?
38|I don't understand it at all.
38|But even if I don't understand, when I've lost my way, when I'm alone-!
38|We feel like we have to say that!
38|You and I both! We've felt it different ways, but haven't we still felt it?!
38|You can't see her, can't hear her, may not even be able to smell her, but even so...
38|No, because of that, it's my duty to get her safely to her mother's!
38|I thought you'd say that.
38|I've finally realized something about you, Araragi-kun.
38|Hey, Araragi-kun.
38|You came calling for me the same day you found out about my problem.
38|Why?
38|Perhaps you saved me because it was me?
38|But it wasn't like that. It didn't seem like that.
38|Instead, you'd simply save anyone.
38|Saving you wasn't that outrageous.
38|Don't exaggerate it.
38|But I had been possessed for over two years.
38|There were plenty of people who figured out my problem,
38|but you were the only one who reacted like you did.
38|Well, I'm the only me.
38|Right. That's right.
38|I have one last message from Oshino-san, Araragi-kun.
38|It's to teach you a cheat code you can only use this time.
38|Cheat code?
38|Okay, let's go.
38|Go? Go where?
38|To Tsunade-san's house, of course.
38|And... Araragi-kun...
38|What?
38|I love you.
38|Congratulations.
38|If a lost cow is a ghost-type oddity,
38|then it doesn't assimilate new information.
38|Information - that is, knowledge.
38|We're here.
38|It's a given for someone like me who doesn't know the area,
38|But even Senjougahara, who can't see the snail, can get lost.
38|But it doesn't know what it doesn't know.
38|No, even if it knows, it can't deal with it.
38|But... This is...
38|In example, urban renewal.
38|If you use a route based on the new roads,
38|a lost cow can't handle it.
38|After taking an hour to get somewhere that should have been no more than ten minutes on foot,
38|we arrived at the objective.
38|But...
38|Senjougahara.
38|Are you sure this is the place?
38|Yes, I'm sure.
38|Should it be like this?
38|I'm home! I made it back!
38|Good work, Araragi-kun.
38|You were pretty impressive.
38|But you're the one who did the work this time.
38|I guess, maybe.
38|But it's not like that, is it.
38|By the way, Araragi-kun.
38|You haven't answered me yet.
38|What will you do?
38|I think you got the wrong impression.
38|Come on, didn't I say you didn't have to do anything big to pay me back?
38|That was just an excuse.
38|I thought I'd get you to confess to me.
38|But don't worry. I don't really feel that indebted to you.
38|After all, Araragi-kun, you'd rescue anyone.
38|But even if you hadn't saved me, and I observed you save Hanekawa-san or someone instead,
38|I think I'd still have felt you were something special.
38|Oh well. I may be overexaggerating it,
38|but to put it bluntly, I just enjoy talking to you.
38|But we haven't even talked that much, have we?
38|I guess.
38|So I want to talk with you more.
38|How do I say it... I don't know if it's like I'm just trying to make myself like you.
38|I see.
38|I don't mind if you think about it like this.
38|Unluckily, you were fallen for by a crazy virgin so starved for love
38|that she'd fall for anyone who showed a little kindness.
38|I see.
38|Luck wasn't on your side. Curse your usual behavior.
38|If you tell me you want to think about it like a coward,
38|I'm gonna despise you, Araragi-kun.
38|You shouldn't make women feel embarrassed.
38|I get it, I just don't really quite accept it at the moment.
38|But, Senjougahara, can I set a condition too?
38|A condition, or, well, something like a promise.
38|A promise? What?
38|Don't ever pretend you can see something you can't, or that you can't see something you can.
38|If our viewpoints are inconsistent, let's talk it over.
38|Promise me.
38|Certainly.
38|All right, let's get going.
38|It's getting pretty dark.
38|Can we put it into words?
38|Into words?
38|I don't like that kind of unclear relationship.
38|Oh, you mean that.
38|It'd be great if it came into fashion.
38|Huh?
38|Senjougahara fascination.
38|Bro, it's morning! Get up!
38|Come on, you've got to get up!
38|I promised not to leave home next Mother's Day,
38|but I don't know if it was a good idea.
38|Mom said she's gonna wash the sheets today!
38|Bro, you've gotta get up so she can start the laundry!
38|That morning, I safely defused my sisters' rage.
38|Hey, you-!
38|Aragi-san!
38|That's not enough "ra"s.
38|Sorry, I stuttered.
38|What are you doing?
38|Well, how do I put it.
38|Well, um.
38|I graduated from being a haunting spirit to a wandering spirit!
38|Think of it like a special two-rank promotion.
38|Um, Araragi-san? I think I'm going to loiter around here for a while.
38|If you see me, why don't you stop and chat?
38|I'm Karen!
38|I'm Tsukihi!
38|You're a pitcher!
38|The pitcher winds up, and here's the pitch!
38|But it's four balls in a row!
38|No control!
38|What kind of pitch was your fourth pitch?
38|I don't know!
38|Next time! Suruga Monkey part 1!
38|It couldn't have been a straight.

38|Ghostory
38|"By the way, Hachikuji. Have you really been to your mom's house like you say you have?"
38|"I really have.
38|I'm not lying."
38|"I see......"
38|But it's been a while,
38|so I got lost.
38|No, that's not it. Since she met a snail, if it isn't the first place--
38|No, wait.
38|Why would Hachikuji meet a snail?
38|Reason.
38|There was a reason I was assaulted by a vampire. And there was one for Hanekawa, and for Senjougahara.
38|Thus--There must be a
38|reason for Hachikuji too.
38|"Hey, this is a simple way of putting it, but your goal is to meet your mom, not reach your objective, right?" "That's a horrible way to say it, but yeah, I guess"
38|"So why not have her come visit you? Even if you can't reach
38|Tsunade-san's house, it's not like your mom is stuck in there and can't come out."
38|"It's impossible. I can't meet her."
38|Hachikuji
38|answered swiftly.
38|If she could do that, she would.
38|But she can't. I can't even call her on the phone.
38|Hmph.
38|"I can't do anything but try to visit mommy like this. Even though I know I can absolutely never get there."

39|Aryaryagi-san!
39|It's "Araragi".
39|Sorry, I stuttered.
39|Don't say people's names like Airhead Hachibei does.
39|I think it's cute.
39|And isn't it strangely appropriate?
39|By the way, Araragi-san, where are you going?
39|Back home for a minute.
39|Are you going out again after that?
39|Yeah, to Senjougahara's.
39|Our midterms are coming up.
39|I got her to help me study.
39|Hey, you remember Senjougahara, don't you?
39|That tsundere, right?
39|But the two of you are doing that man-woman thing, right?
39|I guess.
39|So you say you're gonna study, but you're just gonna flirt instead, right?
39|Going to see your lover right before the exams that can hold you back a year?
39|That's just suicidal, Araragi-san.
39|You're asking me whether I can graduate or not?
39|And don't say it's suicidal!
39|Well, I think it's just plain suicide.
39|Looks like I have to go wherever I have to in order to settle things with you!
39|Go wherever you have to?
39|Like my breasts, or my butt?
39|Araragi-san, just what are you looking for in a grade-schooler's body?
39|Don't trail one's coat tails!
39|Hey, Hachikuji.
39|You're-
39|Hey, Araragi-senpai!
39|What a coincidence.
39|Do you really think a staged coincidence like this is believable?!
39|Hachikuji ran away?
39|What's been up with you lately?
39|"Do you really think a staged coincidence like this is believable", huh?
39|I didn't think you'd think that.
39|It was the perfect line for this situation. I guess this is what they mean by "witty"!
39|Yeah, that's it.
39|To be honest, I came after you.
39|Yeah. I know.
39|Really, you knew?!
39|I knew you would.
39|You see right through everything novices like me do.
39|It makes me feel awkward and embarrassed.
39|But honestly, I admire you.
39|Don't you have a club to be at?
39|Should you be here?
39|My hand's messed up right now.
39|So, Kanbaru.
39|What did you want today?
39|Oh, right.
39|Did you read the world news section of the paper this morning?
39|I want to hear your perspective on the political situation in Russia.
39|Is this a current affairs gag?!
39|Ah, you're more interested in India's IT industry?
39|I didn't read the paper this morning.
39|Oh.
39|Oh, by the way, Araragi-senpai. You didn't notice anything strange today, did you?
39|Not really.
39|It was just normal.
39|I'm a bit stressed because exams are coming up.
39|I'm headed to a study group today too.
39|Study group?
39|Well, I call it that, but it's one-on-one and one-sided, so it's more like tutoring.
39|There's someone in my class with great grades,
39|so I got her to help me.
39|Is it Senjougahara-senpai?
39|How did you know?
39|If you're talking about someone in your class with good grades, it has to be Senjougahara-senpai.
39|I've heard the rumors for a while.
39|Well, I guess.
39|All right, then I'll stay out of your way.
39|Gonna ask you to let me go for today.
39|I see.
39|Good luck, Araragi-senpai.
39|Rararagi-san!
39|Hachikuji.
39|Don't sing my name like something from a musical.
39|My name's Araragi.
39|Sorry. I stuttered.
39|No, it was intentional.
39|I stuttuted!
39|It wasn't intentional?!
39|By the way, who was that?
39|An underclassman. She's the ace of the basketball club.
39|I don't really know why, but to be completely blunt, she's been tailing me for the past few days.
39|Honestly, it seems like she's up to something.
39|Perhaps she's fallen for you.
39|Huh? No way.
39|I'm not the main character in some galge.
39|There's no way I'd just wake up one day and be popular with the girls.
39|The woman in me tells me I'm right.
39|She might confess to you soon!
39|What will you do? What will you do?!
39|Come on. I don't like this trend of explaining anything and everything about my love life.
39|It's impossible.
39|And I've already captured the toughest character.
39|I feel like I've been described unpleasantly.
39|Nevertheless...
39|Teaching is such a hard thing to do.
39|Why do you think I'm studying?
39|Because you're dumb, right?
39|I've never had a hard time studying in my whole life,
39|so I don't understand what it is you don't understand.
39|Really?
39|If I work with you on getting ready for the upcoming exams,
39|I think you'll be able to pass.
39|But just what are you thinking about doing from here on?
39|From here on?
39|Your ambitions.
39|My ambitions?
39|That came out of the blue.
39|You're already in your second month of your senior year.
39|You said before you're fine as long as you graduate,
39|but does that mean you're getting a job as soon as you graduate?
39|Well...
39|Or will you be a freeter for a while?
39|Or perhaps a NEET?
39|Or perhaps you'll choose to enroll in a trade school?
39|Who are you, my mom?
39|Mom? What do you mean?
39|I'm your lover, right?
39|Ambitions, huh.
39|That's right, I've gotta decide soon.
39|Senjougahara, what are you gonna do?
39|Go to college. If I can get a recommendation, at least.
39|Oh...
39|But if I can, I'd like to walk the same path as you.
39|Well, my grades are a bit too-
39|Then what shall we do?
39|Shall we live together after graduation?
39|If we did that, even though our paths split, we'd have more time together than we do now.
39|Well, it wouldn't be that bad.
39|It wouldn't be that bad?
39|What do you mean by that?
39|I want to. Please let me.
39|Oh.
39|What kind of relationship is this?
39|You sigh a lot, Araragi-kun.
39|Did you know that every time you sigh, a little bit of happiness escapes?
39|I've already done it a thousand times or so and let my happiness escape.
39|I don't care how much happiness you let escape,
39|but I'd prefer if you didn't sigh in front of me.
39|It's troublesome.
39|You say some really mean things.
39|I'm just saying you're troublesome due to lovesickness.
39|I don't even know how to reply to that.
39|By the way, Araragi-kun, did you know?
39|I've never broken up with a man.
39|So I don't plan on breaking up with you.
39|So neither of us know how to attract others?
39|Hey, Senjougahara.
39|What?
39|Do you still have a stapler on you?
39|Now that you mention it, I haven't been carrying any lately.
39|I'm such a silly-dilly.
39|Silly, huh.
39|Come to think of it, you were the ace of the track team in middle school, right?
39|Correct.
39|But you don't do track anymore?
39|Correct.
39|I don't have any reason to.
39|I don't want to relive the past.
39|Oh, right. Hey, Senjougahara.
39|What?
39|Did you know Kanbaru Suruga?
39|Oh, Kanbaru Suruga, huh?
39|That's a nostalgic name to hear.
39|I see.
39|I knew it. An old acquaintance.
39|When I said I was going to a study group,
39|Kanbaru thought of Senjougahara rather than Hanekawa first when I mentioned the best in the class.
39|Is this why?
39|She was my junior in middle school.
39|Isn't Kanbaru still your junior?
39|After all, you go to the same school.
39|"Kanbaru"?
39|You refer to her like you know her well.
39|Just what did she do, Araragi-kun?
39|Araragi-kun, your wounds heal very quickly, don't they?
39|So I bet it'd be okay if I just took out an eyeball.
39|Stop it, stop it! Not my eyeball!
39|There's nothing guilty about it!
39|I didn't mean it like I knew her well!
39|I'm devoted to you, Senjougahara!
39|Oh, you're saying things to make me feel good.
39|I may have gotten a little too enthusiastic.
39|Did I shock you?
39|You look ready to kill someone when you do that.
39|When I kill someone, it'll be you.
39|I'll make you my first victim.
39|I won't pick anyone but you. I promise.
39|I don't want that kind of twisted love!
39|Isn't it nice? Try to be understanding.
39|If I kill you, that means I'll be the one closest to you when you're on your deathbed.
39|Isn't it romantic?
39|No way.
39|If someone's going to kill me, I want it to be anyone but you.
39|I'd rather be killed any way than how you'd kill me.
39|What, you hate me that much?
39|If anyone else kills you, I'll kill that person.
39|I have to keep my promise.
39|Anyway, we were talking about Kanbaru.
39|I was the track ace and she was the basketball ace.
39|So even though we were in different grades, we were drawn together.
39|And...
39|And...?
39|Even outside of team activities, in private, we looked after each other.
39|By the way, Araragi-kun.
39|Why don't you tell me why you even mentioned her name?
39|If there's anything to feel guilty about, I'm sure you'll be able to explain.
39|I see.
39|Hey, Araragi-kun.
39|What?
39|What's flooded above and on fire below?
39|A bath heater, right?
39|Bzzzt. The answer is...
39|Kanbaru Suruga's household.
39|What are you planning on doing to the school star's house?!
39|Well, enough joking around.
39|Araragi-kun, Kanbaru realized my secret a year before you did.
39|Really?
39|It was right when I became a junior.
39|Meaning it was right when Kanbaru came to Naoetsu High.
39|Given her personality, she must have tried to help you.
39|Correct.
39|Even though I turned her down.
39|I dealt with it like I did when you offered.
39|In spite of that, you tried to get involved.
39|Kanbaru didn't come back after that.
39|That's as far as that got.
39|But weren't you friends?
39|In middle school, yes. Not now.
39|She's a total stranger.
39|Well, I understand your relationship with Kanbaru,
39|but why's she following me around?
39|She probably found out that you were my lover.
39|What?
39|So she's interested in what kind of guy could win over Senjougahara Hitagi
39|and decided to check me out?
39|I think that's it.
39|She must be annoying you, Araragi-kun.
39|Oh well, I can't offer an explanation.
39|Even though it's my fault for not being able to settle my accounts with people.
39|But didn't you fiercely turn her down a year ago?
39|And it's been like that since then?
39|But now she's interested just because you got a boyfriend?
39|This is just me talking,
39|but for Kanbaru, Senjougahara Hitagi was her upperclassman crush.
39|Thus, when I refused her help,
39|even though she was going to listen to me and not cause any more trouble...
39|She still hasn't been able to forget about me.
39|You don't have to call it annoying.
39|It's not like she means any harm by it.
39|It's annoying, whether she means harm or not.
39|Hanekawa speaking. Sorry to keep you waiting.
39|What's wrong?
39|You don't call me that often, Araragi-kun.
39|No, it's fine.
39|I was just doing some light studying.
39|That's right.
39|Of course I know about that.
39|Really?
39|The "Baruhara Combo".
39|They were called the "Baruhara Combo".
39|Senjougahara-san from the track team, and Kanbaru-san from the basketball team. The "Baruhara Combo".
39|"Baruhara Combo"?
39|What do you mean, "Baruhara"?
39|The baru from Kanbaru and the hara from Senjougahara make Baruhara.
39|And "Valhalla" is the heavenly palace of the chief god in Norse mythology, Odin.
39|So it means the holy place of the god of battle, whence to the spirits of heroes who fell in battle were invited.
39|That works with the "god" in Kanbaru's name and the "battlefield" in Senjougahara's name, huh.
39|Thus, "Baruhara Combo".
39|That's a pretty clever way of putting it.
39|Well, they called them a combo, so at least it wasn't like they didn't get along or were on bad terms.
39|I see.
39|And Senjougahara-san stayed on the team right up until graduation,
39|so they must have at least known each other as athletes.
39|You know everything.
39|I don't know everything, just what I know.
39|Oh, yeah. She was popular among both boys and girls.
39|She had a good reputation among upperclassmen and people of her grade,
39|but I guess she was most popular among younger girls.
39|That's what you asked me about, and that's how it was.
39|But you're not interested in how Senjougahara-san used to be,
39|you're interested in her now, right?
39|It's great that you like each other, but try to keep proper male-female relations in mind, Araragi-kun.
39|Senjougahara-san seems serious,
39|so I don't think you can let this become a relationship where you're always irritated at each other.
39|Senjougahara-san is difficult.
39|So because of that, well... I don't want to talk like I really know all that well,
39|but Senjougahara has built an impregnable self field around herself.
39|Just like the one you have.
39|Everyone has a self field they call "privacy" or whatever,
39|but for you and her, it goes beyond that and turns into a siege mentality.
39|And for people like you, just interacting with other people is often unpleasant.
39|Am I right?
39|About both of you?
39|But think of it this way, Araragi-kun.
39|Even if you're not social, that's different from being misanthropic.
39|Receiving guests is the most difficult thing for me, but not if you're the guest.
39|You get what it means, right?
39|And you understand what I want to say?
39|No, I get it.
39|Wanting to know about your dear girlfriend is normal.
39|But it's best not to peer too deep into a lover's past.
39|It won't be all fun and games,
39|so try not to dig too deep too quick.
39|All right, bye-bye.
39|If I could, I'd like to give Senjougahara back what she lost and what she threw away.
39|It might be none of my business, and an unwanted gift.
39|But I can't help thinking about it.
39|After all, there's no way I could do it.
39|Could you give this to Oshino-san?
39|What's this-?
39|Payment for Oshino?
39|You got it ready quicker than I thought.
39|Did you work part-time?
39|I helped my dad out with his work for a little bit.
39|Well, I guess it's more like, "I overdid helping him", but that's the money I earned doing it.
39|I was gonna hand it over, but I forgot it at her place.
39|Araragi-kun.
39|Hey, long time no see.
39|I came to bring the thing you forgot.
39|I'm not Karen!
39|And I'm not Tsukihi!
39|We're not!

39|It's better to back off now while there's still time
39|Before we misunderstand each other even more
39|Before I knew it,
39|The staple you used to bind your words pierced my heart
39|It's your fault
39|Don't come to me the way I am now
39|Don't look at me wherever I go
39|Don't let go of me with that smile
39|No matter who you are
39|I prayed for an endless eternity
39|In the sky that stretches on forever
39|Like the sea with its harsh love,
39|You dove into my heart to take it

39|Kanbaru Suruga stands out so much that there's no one on campus who hasn't heard of her, so of course I've heard her name many times.
39|No, for Kanbaru Suruga...
39|No, perhaps describing her as "a star" captures the nuance better than "famous".
39|Kanbaru Suruga is the ace of the basketball team.
39|As a freshman, she made varsity right away after enrolling. Maybe it's because the girls' basketball team, which was shameful and always lost in the first
39|round of tournaments, suddenly started making the nationals. Perhaps it's because she built up a legend of being a monster on the court that she became such a star.
39|It's not that she's
39|particularly tall.
39|She has the build of a normal high school girl.
39|If anything, she's a bit small and slim.
39|The image that comes to mind when you think "willowy".
39|But Kanbaru Suruga--leaps.
39|Last year, just once, I went with an acquaintance to a game that Suruga Kanbaru played in. It was just an exhibition match, but--She fabulously avoided, no, slipped through the other team's defense.
39|And she finished with a dunk like in that boys' comic that swept Japan.
39|Easily, calmly,
39|with the easily satisfied grin of a sporty girl, she seemed so happy.
39|No matter how many times, no matter how many tens of times.
39|Of course, she doesn't know me. There's no reason for her to.
39|Bandage
39|Is what I thought.
39|That's the assumption I made.

39|Suruga Monkey Part 2
39|Sorry
40|Forgetting what someone just gave you is an act worthy of death, Araragi-kun.
40|Oh, sorry.
40|Even if you apologize, I won't forgive you. So I came to give you a good ass kicking...
40|But it looks like you got hit by a car.
40|Something that looks like your beloved bike is wrecked over there.
40|It's stuck in a telephone pole.
40|You'd have to be hit by a tractor-trailer or something for that to happen.
40|No, I just stumbled. Alone.
40|I was trying to talk on the phone and pedal at the same time,
40|and I slammed right into the telephone post.
40|I see.
40|But you slammed into it hard enough to smash that block wall
40|and got away with so few injuries...
40|I'm impressed.
40|Hm, you don't need an ambulance, do you?
40|Naw. If I rest for a little bit, I should be able to move.
40|I see. Then I'll do something for you.
40|Lie there and be happy until you can move.
40|Here you go, Araragi-senpai.
40|Sorry about the clutter.
40|Make yourself at home.
40|Honestly, you have an impressive level of sensitivity if you're hesitant to enter the room of a girl you don't know.
40|But that's not the case right now, is it?
40|Yeah.
40|Kanbaru.
40|What?
40|Can I have an hour-no, just thirty minutes-to clean this room?
40|So, where shall we begin, Araragi-senpai?
40|Actually, let's start with last night.
40|I thought I'd apologize.
40|So it was you?
40|Saying "it was you" makes you sound irritated, Araragi-senpai.
40|You saw through it?
40|If you didn't, you wouldn't have visited me.
40|Not really.
40|It was just guesswork.
40|I judged by your build, outline, and silhouette.
40|And by people who knew I'd gone to Senjougahara's place to study.
40|By breaking it down to those points, and thinking about it that way...
40|I see. That was a great idea.
40|Does this have anything to do with the rumor that some guys can identify girls by their hips?
40|Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.
40|Uh, apologies aside, what I'd really like to know is the reason.
40|Anyway, about the reason, I'd like to ask about that power. That supernatural power.
40|Just what are you-
40|I guess that's the best place to begin.
40|That's right.
40|But...
40|First I want to ask if you're the kind of person who can believe in extraordinary things.
40|Extraordinary things?
40|You don't get it, huh.
40|What I meant was, can you believe what you see with your own eyes?
40|I don't believe anything I don't see.
40|So I believe everything I see.
40|Of course, it was the same with Senjougahara.
40|You even knew about that?
40|You on the basketball team and Senjougahara on track made the Valhalla Combo, right?
40|That's right! You really do know a lot!
40|Sorry I overlooked that.
40|I heard the reason too. It's a well thought out nickname.
40|Isn't it? I'm the one who came up with it.
40|She came up with it herself?
40|It's been a while since I've felt so hopelessly sad for someone.
40|Well, that's about it. The Valhalla Combo was us in middle school-
40|No.
40|Before we talk about that, there's something I want to show you.
40|To be honest, it's not really something I want people to see.
40|I know I may not act like it, but I'm still a girl.
40|Well, it's like this.
40|It's like a monkey's paw...
40|Araragi-senpai, you have such unfathomably quick insight.
40|I'm impressed! I didn't think you'd be able to identify it with just a glance!
40|Don't come to that conclusion ahead of time!
40|I'm just saying what I see. I didn't detect anything.
40|Really? "The Monkey's Paw" was the title of a short story by William Wymark Jacobs.
40|It's an item said to fulfill its owner's wishes in twisted ways.
40|I didn't know about it at all.
40|You stated the truth without knowing anything!
40|Araragi-senpai, you must have been selected by someone up above.
40|C-Can I touch it?
40|Sure, it should be fine now.
40|I-I see.
40|It's living... I knew it, this is a living-type oddity...
40|Don't make weird sounds!
40|It's because you touched me in a weird way!
40|I didn't touch you in a weird way or anything!
40|I'm ticklish.
40|So there's no reason to make a noise that breaks down how your character's been established up until now!
40|Oh well.
40|Just like this, I can move it at will.
40|But there's times when I can't. No, times when it moves against my will.
40|Against your will?
40|No, by will I mean-
40|It's hard to explain, but... I'm the one who assaulted you last night.
40|But I don't really have any memory of it.
40|It was as if I was hallucinating, or dreaming.
40|It's not like I don't remember at all, but...
40|A trance. That's a trance.
40|The kind of oddity that possesses humans violates both the body and mind.
40|You know a lot.
40|I see. These kinds of things are called oddities.
40|Well, I don't particularly know that much.
40|I've just had a lot of experience with them recently for some reason.
40|And there's someone I know who does know.
40|I see. I'm glad you're such a great person.
40|If you had run away when I showed you this arm, we wouldn't have been able to talk.
40|And I think I would've been pretty hurt.
40|Putting it that way, I was a little bit surprised.
40|But since you showed me that first, I'm confident I won't be shocked no matter what follows.
40|I see! Yeah, that's why I showed you this arm first.
40|Have to get the tough things out of the way first.
40|Now let's get to the point.
40|I'm a lesbian.
40|You're a guy, so that may have been a bit blunt.
40|Um, lemme rephrase that.
40|I'm into yuri.
40|That's the same damn thing!
40|What? Why?
40|You and Senjougahara were called the "Valhalla Combo" in middle school, right? Just as fellow students?
40|Or were you "that girl" for her?
40|When she said yesterday that she'd never broken up with a guy,
40|could she possibly have meant that?
40|Wrong.
40|Senjougahara-senpai was my unrequited love.
40|To me, Senjougahara-senpai was my pure and perfect ideal upperclassman.
40|I was happy just being by her side.
40|She was popular with everyone,
40|but you can draw a line between that and my feelings for her.
40|I have pride in that.
40|I would have been willing to die for her back then.
40|But she changed.
40|She changed completely.
40|I'd heard she contracted a severe illness when she entered high school.
40|And due to its length, she quit track.
40|But I didn't think she had changed that much.
40|I thought it was just a bad rumor.
40|But I was wrong.
40|It wasn't just a rumor.
40|Something even worse happened inside Senjougahara-senpai's body.
40|When I realized that, I thought I had to do something.
40|I thought I had to save her.
40|Didn't I?
40|In middle school, even though we were in different grades and on different teams,
40|she was so kind to me.
40|So this time, I thought I'd save her.
40|I thought I could do something about what Senjougahara-senpai had.
40|Even if I couldn't do that, I thought I could heal her heart just by being with her.
40|I really thought so.
40|But I was rejected with no consideration.
40|"I don't think of you as a friend or even as an underclassman. Not now, not then."
40|She said that straight-up.
40|So since then, I haven't gotten close to her.
40|After all, that's the only thing she wanted from me.
40|Of course, there was no way that I could forget about her.
40|But...
40|That's...
40|If forgetting her could help her even a little bit,
40|I'd accept it.
40|You...
40|But then a year passed.
40|I learned about you.
40|I saw you two billing and cooing in a classroom one morning.
40|She had a happy smile she'd never shown me even once in middle school.
40|Don't you understand?
40|You did what I wanted to for so long,
40|but never could and gave up on,
40|as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
40|Kanbaru... No, that's-!
40|At first, I was jealous.
40|I tried to reconsider. But in the end, I was still jealous.
40|Why not me?
40|I figured that if I was a man, it'd have worked. That it only didn't because I'm a woman.
40|Even if I couldn't be a friend or an underclassman, that didn't rule out being a lover.
40|So... So wouldn't it be okay if it was me?
40|I became jealous of you and disappointed in her.
40|And I was dumbfounded.
40|So what about healing Senjougahara-senpai?
40|So what about backing off?
40|Do you really think she'll praise you if you do that?
40|You're such an idiot. A hypocrite!
40|But...
40|Even still...
40|I just wanted her to be kind to me like the old days.
40|It doesn't matter if it's ego or whatever, I just want to be by her side...
40|So...
40|So that's why I wished on this paw.
40|To be by Senjougahara-senpai's side...
40|Is this a transformation? Are you an alien?
40|That's a secret.
40|So he's named Oshino Meme?
40|Meme in katakana?
40|Yeah, but he's not as cute as his name implies.
40|If we don't hurry up, the sun's gonna set.
40|Your left arm gets bad at night, right?
40|Look at it the other way. As long as the sun's up there's no problem.
40|We'll definitely be fine for at least a few more hours.
40|Araragi-senpai, there's something I want to ask you.
40|What?
40|What about Senjougahara-senpai caught your eye?
40|You spent two years as just classmates, not even really speaking.
40|Why are you asking that?
40|Well. If you just want her for her body, maybe I can take her place.
40|I think I'm pretty cute.
40|I can grow my hair longer and look a bit more girlish, and improve my complexion.
40|And I've played sports since way back, so I've got a nice slim waist.
40|I'm seriously up for it.
40|If you want it, I'll be the uke to your seme anywhere, anytime.
40|Seme? Uke?
40|Why do I have to want that?!
40|Oh, I see.
40|Araragi-senpai, you're not into BL? That's surprising.
40|I don't wanna talk BL with a girl from a younger class!
40|BL is an abbreviation for "boys' love".
40|I know! That wasn't the misunderstanding!
40|I just realized that when I cleaned Kanbaru's room-
40|You really didn't misunderstand?
40|Then just what are you so angry about?
40|Don't tell me you're an uke?
40|Shut up! This conversation is over!
40|I'm afraid I'm going to say something intrusive, Araragi-senpai.
40|If you can't even enjoy talking dirty with a younger girl,
40|how are you going to survive once you get out into society?
40|That's exactly the kind of thing I don't want a younger girl trying to convince me of.
40|Say what you want.
40|If you cling onto that cheap fantasy of womanhood,
40|you'll be so insistent on purity that you can't even say hello.
40|There's no way around it. Even girls like to talk dirty.
40|So let's get back to talking about whether you prefer boxers or briefs.
40|We never talked about that to begin with.
40|Oh? Then were we talking about whether I wear panties under my bike shorts?
40|You're not wearing any panties, Kanbaru-san?!
40|S-So underneath those bike shorts you've got peeking out from under your skirt is-
40|Even if I wasn't, would it really be that surprising?
40|Bike shorts have always been a type of underwear.
40|That makes it even worse!
40|Showing off your panties all the time is no way to go through life!
40|When you put it that way, you're right,
40|but for now, it's just a stylish gift from a sporty girl.
40|Wrong! It's perverted exhibitionism!
40|Oh, that's right, now I remember.
40|We weren't talking about that.
40|We were talking about whether I could be a replacement for Senjougahara.
40|Hold it, don't change the topic back to avoid getting to the truth of matters!
40|Give a definite answer as to whether you're wearing any or not!
40|Why don't we leave out that little vulgar bit of information?
40|It's trivial.
40|It's not trivial! It's the divide between my underclassman being a sporty girl and an exhibitionist!
40|I suppose so...
40|Then why don't you think of it like this?
40|I'm a sporty girl, and an exhibitionist.
40|A sporty girl to those who think of me as one,
40|and an exhibitionist to those who think of me as one.
40|Stop with the wordplay!
40|Saying "I'm xx to those who think of me as xx, and ** to those who think of me as **"
40|is only impressive through middle school!
40|What are you, my little sister?!
40|But seriously, Kanbaru.
40|No matter how hard you try, you can't take Senjougahara's place.
40|After all, you're not Senjougahara.
40|No one can become anyone else's replacement.
40|No one can become anyone else.
40|No matter how much you like her or look up to her.
40|That's right. It's just as you say.
40|Yeah. Anyway, let's stop wasting time chatting and get going.
40|H-Hey, Araragi-senpai. Wasn't that kid so damn cute?
40|Why are you saying that with the biggest grin you've had today on your face?
40|I want to embrace her. No, I want to be embraced by her!
40|But it's best not to get drawn in by her.
40|You're late, Araragi-kun. I was about to fall asleep waiting for you.
40|What's up? You brought a different girl today too.
40|Every time we meet, it's a different one.
40|I offer my sincere congratulations.
40|Shut up. Don't just keep using that line.
40|Oh, that's right, I saw Shinobu on the stairs.
40|What's she doing there?
40|She's been sulking ever since I brought a box back from Mister Donut and ate one more donut than her.
40|She's been like that since yesterday.
40|What the hell kind of vampire is she?
40|Oshino, this is Kanbaru Suruga, from one grade below me.
40|Kanbaru's written with the "kami" from "god" and the "hara" from "fields".
40|Even though it's normally "hara", it's "baru" here.
40|Suruga, umm...
40|It's the "suruga" from "bondage torture".
40|Oh, bondage torture. I get it.
40|I'm Araragi-senpai's underclassman. Pleased to meet you.
40|Pleased to meet you, young lady. I'm Oshino Meme.
40|If you're his underclassman, you're also Tsundere-chan's, right?
40|Anyway, Oshino. First off, take this.
40|It's from "Tsundere-chan"-Senjougahara.
40|Oh, money, money!
40|That's great! I was about to have to cut down my standard of living.
40|And what's up with the young lady?
40|That bandage, huh?
40|Oshino-san, I'm-
40|Wait your turn. It doesn't seem that interesting.
40|Stories about how one's arm got bandaged are never interesting.
40|Especially to me.
40|Even worse, it's your left arm.
40|Take off the bandage and let me take a look, young lady.
40|Is this enough?
40|Yeah, that's enough.
40|I see. I figured.
40|Araragi-kun. Young lady.
40|Let me set your initial mistaken impression straight.
40|The young lady's left arm isn't a monkey's paw.
40|I've never heard of a monkey's paw binding onto its owner.
40|Young lady, that hand once belonged to a mummy.
40|It binded onto you, sucked your life force, and now it's a rainy devil.
40|Rainy?
40|Yeah, a lesser devil.
40|Among them, the amount of devils with a monkey's paw and a raincoat are certainly limited.
40|If it binds with its owner, it has to be a rainy devil.
40|It's not a monkey's paw, it's a devil's arm.
40|It can make anything come true.
40|But it takes your soul in exchange.
40|Her soul?
40|In exchange for your soul, it grants three wishes.
40|Isn't that obvious? Since it's a devil.
40|I'm Karen!
40|I'm Tsukihi!

40|I prayed for an endless eternity
40|In the sky that stretches on forever

40|But where are you, Altair?
40|You'll be alone like this
40|I looked up from the pitch dark world

40|Please, no matter what
40|Don't be surprised
40|Listen to
40|These feelings
40|Of mine
40|As a ghost story, or a horror, it was well done.
40|A textbook
40|tale of terror.
40|A truly historic, seemingly antique legend--
40|I guess
40|it's a classic.
40|If I asked Kanbaru for her opinion, she'd say that it's not on the level of a vampire, and that
40|a monkey's paw is something pretty major that's been remixed in various ways by various media.
40|The biggest thing that makes the
40|monkey's paw the monkey's paw is--
40|It is said that the monkey's paw fulfills its owner's wishes. However, it is said to do so in a way that does not suit the owner.
40|It seems to have those two points.
40|It's that kind of item with an interesting history.
40|It seems
40|that
40|the monkey's paw was produced in India by a miracle-working sage in order to teach men
40|that they must live within the constricts of fate, and that to contradict it invites disaster.
40|When I think about things that grant three wishes,
40|my first thought is the magic lamp from Arabian Nights, but that had many different conclusions in many different stories.
40|Beyond that,
40|around the world,
40|stories like those are well-known.
40|Perhaps the type of story where something that can grant any wish appears before
40|someone is an archetypal story for those who possess unfulfillable huge desires.

40|Next Time
40|Suruga Monkey Part 3
40|It didn't turn out very good
41|In that paulownia wood case was a mummified left hand.
41|It was given to Kanbaru by her late mother. The first time she used it was in the fourth grade.
41|I want to run fast.
41|Kanbaru, who recently transferred following her parents' deaths, wasn't fitting in with her new class.
41|And she was teased a lot for running slowly.
41|Then she thought that maybe, if she came first at a race in a nearby athletics competition,
41|everyone would look at her differently.
41|It seems like she made her wish with that in mind.
41|A monster assaulted four other students who were in the race with Kanbaru.
41|The next day, all four of them were absent from school.
41|Kanbaru soon stumbled upon Jacobs' 'The Monkey's Paw',
41|and its contents made her tremble.
41|Thinking of it normally, in order to cancel the first wish, she'd have to wish on the mummified paw.
41|But she became scared while researching mummies,
41|because she didn't know how the second wish would be fulfilled.
41|At the practice for the next day's race, Kanbaru ran with five others, all different from the previous four.
41|So I ran. I put effort into getting faster.
41|It was as plain as day that if I didn't do anything, something else would happen.
41|Kanbaru didn't join the track team.
41|Not knowing how long her wish on the Monkey's Paw would remain in effect,
41|she couldn't place herself in situations where there were people faster than her.
41|One day, after hearing of my reputation, Senjougahara-sempai came to a game.
41|She was the track team's ace, so she came to see me since I had a reputation for being fast.
41|And she challenged me to a hundred-meter race, saying it was fine since it wasn't official.
41|It was really hard, but I couldn't help but turn her down.
41|She was such a wonderful upperclassman.
41|It wasn't love at first sight, but after being on speaking terms for three days, I began to like her.
41|Senjougahara-sempai healed me.
41|From then on, Kanbaru put the mummified paw out of her mind.
41|But there were still moments when she felt an urge to use it.
41|When she played against a strong rival in basketball.
41|When she had fierce arguments with friends.
41|And...
41|When I was rejected by Senjougahara-sempai.
41|In the end, I didn't use it.
41|At that point, I understood that my mother gave me the mummified paw
41|because she wanted me to become a person who could overcome any trial with my own strength.
41|That's why Kanbaru remained silent and hid herself from Senjougahara.
41|She may have been able to solve Senjougahara's problem by wishing on the paw, but she didn't.
41|But a year later,
41|Kanbaru learned of me.
41|She saw me by Senjougahara's side.
41|Kanbaru no longer knew when she took the paw out of that paulownia wood box.
41|She didn't even think about why the paw, which extended no further than the wrist, grew all the way to her elbow.
41|And when she realized--
41|Araragi-kun. Young lady.
41|Now that you understand what's going on, what do you plan to do?
41|Meaning?
41|C'mon, Araragi-kun, I'm a competent enough specialist.
41|As a half-baked, comedic kind of authority, I don't mind lending a hand in this kind of situation.
41|W-Will you save me?
41|I won't save you. I'll simply lend a hand.
41|You're the only one who'll be saving yourself, young lady.
41|By the way, Araragi-kun. What am I supposed to do?
41|Oshino...
41|I mean, what am I supposed to help out with this time?
41|First of all, there are two ways to handle this phenomenon.
41|One way is to let the Rainy Devil kill you, Araragi-kun.
41|The other way is...
41|The second is to lop off that beastly left arm.
41|L-Lop it off? Can you only remove the devil part?
41|After that, will her normal arm grow back?
41|It's not like a lizard's tail or something. There's no way it'd be that convenient.
41|Paying just an arm to settle this is a very cheap price.
41|Say what you like, but that'd be pretty inconvenient for me.
41|You tried to kill someone. Isn't that a fair price?
41|I understand what you're trying to say, but hold it, Oshino.
41|Killing someone isn't what Kanbaru wants.
41|She just wants to be with Senjougahara.
41|'She just wants to be with her?' Don't make me laugh.
41|You're really too kind.
41|So kind it makes me sick.
41|Seriously. Can you really believe those sugar-coated words about 'just wanting to be with her'?
41|Am I wrong?
41|Don't you think it's strange, Araragi-kun?
41|Rather than make her faster, why do you think that left hand beat up those around her when she was in elementary school?
41|Well, doesn't the Monkey's Paw fulfill wishes in a way its owner doesn't intend?
41|But it's not the Monkey's Paw.
41|A Rainy Devil is a lesser devil, but a contract is still a contract.
41|If she wished to be faster, it'd normally just make her faster.
41|Does beating down her classmates make her faster?
41|Don't you think that's kind of funny?
41|Then why?
41|Why did a monster in a raincoat come after her classmates?
41|Because the young lady wanted them beaten up.
41|She was having a hard time just after her parents died,
41|and she was being persecuted by her classmates, so it's not at all strange for her to have thoughts of revenge.
41|I...
41|Of course, you think you were unconscious when you wished for that.
41|In your own consciousness, you're sure you wished to run faster.
41|But that's just on the surface. What lies beneath is different.
41|Underneath that wish lurked a dark desire to beat up your classmates.
41|Though it was unconscious, you know what really happened, young lady.
41|But you didn't want to admit it to yourself, so you went looking for a different explanation for that phenomenon,
41|the Monkey's Paw.
41|It's your own rationalization, saying the assault on your classmates was the result
41|of the Monkey's Paw twisting your wish, rather than it being your own intent.
41|But, Oshino...
41|Are you wondering what kind of proof I have, Araragi-kun?
41|If you listen to her, isn't it obvious?
41|What happened with that arm of yours in elementary school, young lady?
41|You didn't realize it until the next day, when you went to class and the seats around you were empty, right?
41|If your left arm had ended up like it is right now, you would've realized something had happened.
41|But you didn't say anything about that earlier.
41|Which means the oddity came one night, and
41|without you noticing, it grafted onto your arm, beat up your classmates, and fulfilled your wish.
41|And without you noticing, it separated you from your left arm.
41|It probably grew from a hand to an arm using the portion of your soul taken in exchange for granting that wish.
41|Hey, Oshino, that means-
41|Araragi-kun, you're really soft-hearted, believing in the assailant's excuse and all.
41|It wouldn't be surprising for her to be jealous of the man
41|who swept away her beloved upperclassman enough to want to kill him.
41|When she attacked you, it wasn't her wish being twisted.
41|Attacking you was what she really wanted.
41|It's about time.
41|I've been waiting.
41|Took you longer than expected.
41|Yeah, it's because I didn't quite understand my limits.
41|It may not be quite enough,
41|but it's better than being drunk from too often.
41|For me, and for Shinobu.
41|It's because you've gotta have a big fight with a devil soon.
41|This is no time to let your imagination run away with itself.
41|You're close to your limit, but I still don't think you have a good chance of winning this fight.
41|Even if your opponent will only be using her left arm.
41|A contract, huh.
41|So with that, the devil will quietly go back to hell or the spirit world or wherever?
41|It'll be fine. I can guarantee you that at the very least.
41|If a contract can't be fulfilled, it will be dissolved, got it?
41|If the devil can't fulfill the young lady's wish, then the wish loses its effect.
41|So, if I'm not killed by the devil, huh?
41|Exactly.
41|Of course, even if you power up by giving Shinobu-chan as much of your blood as you can,
41|I don't think you can manifest more than a tenth of the power you had during spring break when you were a vampire.
41|That's quite a number.
41|Even so, you can't borrow power from Shinobu-chan herself.
41|If you do, it'll be more than just a bluff. We'll have to cut off the young lady's arm.
41|You eliminating it yourself means something.
41|I'll keep an eye on your bag and valuables, Araragi-kun.
41|If you're carrying them, it'll be hard to move.
41|Thanks.
41|Okay, hold on a moment.
41|Can you tell me one thing?
41|What?
41|Why do you want to save someone who's tried to kill you?
41|Even if it's subconsciously, the young lady's taken you as an enemy in love.
41|When you realised that it was her in the raincoat,
41|why did you decide to listen to what she had to say?
41|At that point, you should've blown her off and come straight to me.
41|Hating people is a part of life.
41|I'll pass on getting killed,
41|but if looking up to Senjougahara is the reason Kanbaru hates me, it's forgivable.
41|I see.
41|Well, if that's what you've decided, that's fine.
41|I don't care, it's none of my business.
41|Anyway, Araragi-kun.
41|Go give the young lady some of your strength.
41|Just to tell you, once you go in, you can't get out until everything's over.
41|The door absolutely can't be opened from the inside.
41|And of course, if anything happens, neither I nor Shinobu-chan will show up to save you.
41|Don't forget that.
41|Sure.
41|Sorry to bother you.
41|It's fine.
41|Hey.
41|Sorry, Kanbaru!
41|It's working!
41|She can use her legs? Not just her left arm?
41|Not only does the Rainy Devil's left arm want to attack me, but Kanbaru too?
41|Subconsciously, Kanbaru is rejecting it.
41|Rejecting the fact that her second wish won't be granted.
41|That I won't be killed.
41|Kanbaru has no intention of giving up on Senjougahara.
41|Cut it off.
41|I don't need this kind of left arm.
41|What are you saying, silly?
41|There's no way I can do that.
41|What about basketball?
41|I tried to kill someone!
41|That should compensate for it a little bit.
41|Come on, Kanbaru. I'm not worried about that at all.
41|If you're gonna cut it off, there's a good way to do it.
41|If you use Shinobu-chan's blade, it's possible to take off that left arm so fast she won't even have time to feel pain.
41|Even with Shinobu-chan as she is now, she could cut off a skinny arm like that before breakfast.
41|Shut up, Oshino!
41|Hey, Kanbaru!
41|It's not anything to dwell upon, is it?
41|There's no reason at all for you to feel responsible.
41|This is all due to the Monkey's Paw! No,
41|that oddity called the Rainy Devil is the culprit!
41|The oddity only granted her wish.
41|She wanted it, so it gave it to her.
41|Wasn't it the same with Tsundere-chan?
41|I don't care, Araragi-sempai.
41|You have to care! There's no way you can't!
41|What are you saying?!
41|And what are you going to do about Senjougahara?
41|I... want you and Senjougahara to-
41|I don't care anymore.
41|I don't care anymore, even about Senjougahara-sempai.
41|I don't care, so...
41|I give up, so...
41|You can't.
41|Kanbaru Suruga!
41|Hate! Hate! Hate! Hate!
41|Looks like you've been enjoying yourself.
41|Having fun without me, are you?
41|How unpleasant, Araragi-kun.
41|S-Senjougahara...
41|Did Oshino use my phone?
41|You lied to me, Araragi-kun.
41|You deceived me by saying you hit a telephone pole, and hid everything about Kanbaru from me.
41|Didn't we promise not to do that kind of thing when we started going out?
41|Not to keep any secrets about oddities, no matter how small, from each other?
41|It's not that.
41|I shall certainly deliver ten thousand deaths unto you.
41|But, Araragi-kun, it seems like you've already died about ten thousand times.
41|Perhaps I'll forgive you just this once.
41|Araragi-kun, why are you so silly that you think just by dying, you can solve the whole problem?
41|It's not a joke.
41|If you died, I'd kill Kanbaru no matter what it takes, right?
41|Araragi-kun, are you trying to make a murderer out of me?
41|She saw right through it.
41|Wow, she's so understanding.
41|What's hardest for me to swallow is that even if you weren't in that body,
41|I know you'd subject yourself to the same kind of hardships.
41|If you did these stupid things because you could rely on your immortal body, I'd tell you to do as you like.
41|But Araragi-kun, you do it by just going with the flow of things. I don't get it.
41|Oh well, whether it's being difficult, meddling too much, or unwelcome favors,
41|if it's you doing it, maybe it's not that bad.
41|If one plan was for me to defeat the devil and make Kanbaru's hidden wish impossible to fulfill,
41|another plan was to reveal to Senjougahara that Kanbaru really wanted to kill me,
41|making it impossible for the side of the wish that she showed to be fulfilled.
41|What's more, Senjougahara swore before the devil's eyes that she'd kill Kanbaru if I were killed.
41|Without the devil knowing, it wouldn't have worked.
41|For the Rainy Devil the situation was settled.
41|Man, you saw right through her, Oshino.
41|You... Even compared to a devil, you're such a magnificent bastard.
41|Long time no see, Kanbaru.
41|I'm glad you're well.
41|I love you, Senjougahara-sempai.
41|I know.
41|I don't like you to that degree.
41|But even still, you'll stay by my side?
41|Sorry I kept you waiting.
41|Man, even being the foil has its good points.
41|It's like playing a comedic character designed specifically for myself.
41|Even though I of all people should know how greedy and how much of a sore loser Senjougahara Hitagi is.
41|If it's something really precious, there's no way she'll give up on it.
41|Being difficult.
41|Meddling too much.
41|Unwelcome favors.
41|But, c'mon...
41|Even so, how shall I put it?
41|As a matter of fact, all of them are hard to deal with.
41|Bro! C'mon, it's morning!
41|Come on, you've got to get up!
41|Come on!
41|'Morning, Araragi-sempai.
41|Good morning, Kanbaru-san.
41|Do you need something?
41|Senjougahara-sempai called and said to go get you at your place.
41|Let me grab your bag.
41|All right, let's go.
41|Hey, what about the team?
41|Don't you have practice on Sundays?
41|The break before exams is coming up. You've got to get serious.
41|Nah, I can't play basketball anymore.
41|It may be a bit soon, but I'm retiring since everything was done halfway.
41|The devil's gone, but my arm isn't back to normal.
41|There's no way I can keep playing basketball with my arm like this.
41|But it's powerful and easy to use in and of itself.
41|Give me my bag back now.
41|I'm Karen!
41|I'm Tsukihi!

41|That's Sen-chan's turn.
41|Don't push it.
41|The view I grabbed hold of while I was unconscious
41|isn't the future I was waiting for.
41|That's the smile I don't know & never saw.
41|I stood still, as if stapled to the spot.
41|It's a complete wreck.
41|Our two worlds are overflowing.
41|I'm a total wreck.
41|I can't hold back my paradoxical emotions anymore.
41|With my reckless heart, someday I'll get over you & move on.
41|At some point,
41|a shadowy heart overtook me with these entangled feelings.
41|Run, run. That's always the only thing I can do.
41|So I'll run quickly, quickly, quickly to that destination.

41|New theme song next
41|The Rainy Devil seems to be quite a violent devil.
41|--More than anything, it enjoys the feelings of malice and hostility, grudges and remorse, envy and jealousy; put as a whole, negativity.
41|It sees, causes, draws out, completes peoples' dark sides. It hears people's wishes malevolently, and fulfills them malevolently.
41|The contract itself is,
41|as a contract--
41|In exchange for one's soul, it grants three wishes.
41|When the three
41|wishes are granted--
41|it seems that it will take that human's life and body.
41|Meaning,
41|in the end, that human becomes a devil. That's how it works.
41|If Kanbaru had
41|wished to solve Senjougahara's problem a year ago when she first learned of it
41|that wish probably wouldn't have been granted.
41|Because the only wishes that a Rainy Devil can grant are wishes that are violent and negative.
41|Devils read the hidden
41|side of wishes.
41|If there's a side you show, there's a hidden side too.
41|Destroy
41|She wanted to run fast because she hated her classmates. She wanted to be with Senjougahara because she hated Araragi Koyomi.
41|Yes, it read the hidden side. Yes, it sees the hidden side. It sees her subconscious wish. I see it--the devil.

41|Next Time
41|Nadeko Snake Part 1
41|Come quick
42|I had last met Sengoku Nadeko more than six years ago.
42|Thus, I didn't recognize her at first when we met again.
42|If I had only realized sooner that it was her,
42|perhaps the story wouldn't have ended like this.
42|But those regrets don't mean anything to her or the oddity.
42|That girl just now...
42|I didn't expect to run into anyone up here.
42|Especially not a girl that cute.
42|Whatever, let's keep climbing.
42|Oh, and watch your step.
42|Don't mind the bug bites, but this mountain is full of snakes.
42|By the way, Araragi-senpai...
42|I know I asked you about it yesterday, but just what are you doing up here?
42|Oshino gave me a job.
42|It seems that there's an abandoned shrine up here.
42|He wanted me to stick an ofuda on its altar.
42|Can't he do it himself? He's got plenty of free time.
42|Well, it's my job to do it.
42|He helped me out, so I owe him.
42|Don't you owe him too, Kanbaru?
42|He is a specialist.
42|He doesn't just lend a hand for free.
42|Oh, I see.
42|By the way, did Senjougahara-senpai say anything to you about today, Araragi-senpai?
42|Not really.
42|Did she say anything to you?
42|She told me to try my hardest to act cute.
42|Oh, and she told me this:
42|"If Araragi-kun gives you any trouble, give me all the details."
42|"I'll let you pick which is worse for him: being buried in the mountains or sunk beneath the sea."
42|She'll let you pick the worse one?!
42|Oh, that's right, Kanbaru.
42|Talking about Senjougahara reminded me that it's almost her birthday.
42|Yeah. It's July 7th.
42|I've been thinking about the type of party to have. It's our first time, so I figured something lively would be nice.
42|Perhaps we should invite all our friends and have a small birthday party.
42|No, I think Senjougahara-senpai wants to spend it alone with you.
42|She's that fine of a woman?
42|Hey, Kanbaru.
42|What, Araragi-senpai?
42|How's your left arm doing?
42|According to Oshino-san, it'll heal by the time I become twenty.
42|That's great. When you turn 20, you can play basketball again.
42|I guess.
42|What's wrong, Kanbaru?
42|I'm a little worn out.
42|Worn out? Why don't we find somewhere to rest?
42|There's gotta be somewhere we can sit down.
42|Never mind that, Araragi-senpai. Why don't we eat?
42|Eat?
42|When I'm feeling down, I normally cheer right up when my tummy's full.
42|Got it.
42|Okay, Kanbaru. Find somewhere where we have room to unpack the lunch box.
42|While you're doing that, I'll go place this ofuda.
42|Sure.
42|Sorry for making you do all the work.
42|All right.
42|I feel like I've met that girl somewhere before.
42|But where would I have met a middle-school girl? Through my sisters?
42|Little sister?
42|This is the altar?
42|That should do it.
42|Hey, Kanbaru!
42|Kanbaru!
42|Kanbaru? Kanbaru!
42|Kanbaru?
42|Oh, it's you, Araragi-senpai.
42|Come on, what kind of reaction is that?
42|Sorry.
42|I just lost my head for a second.
42|You don't look that good. Are you okay?
42|If you're feeling that sick, I'll clean off the porch around the altar so you can lie down.
42|No, that's not it.
42|Look at that.
42|Huh?
42|That was... Sengoku Nadeko?
42|These two.
42|This one might be useful.
42|If you're looking for efficiency, you should try that one.
42|I'm surprised you asked me to help you pick reference books.
42|I figured it was about time to focus on my future.
42|Your future?
42|Lately, I've been talking about it with Senjougahara.
42|When I found out about her first choice...
42|Oh... Senjougahara-san is going to the local national university, right? Doesn't she already have a recommendation?
42|You know everything.
42|I don't know everything; I just happen to know this.
42|So you're aiming for the same university as her?
42|Don't tell her yet. I don't want her to get any weird ideas.
42|By the way, Araragi-kun.
42|What's with the sudden formality?
42|Weren't you talking about that ruined shrine at school yesterday?
42|I'm curious about it.
42|What happened after you found that chopped-up snake there?
42|Oh, that?
42|Kanbaru and I dug a hole and buried it, just in case.
42|But when we took a walk around, we found that the whole place was full of snake corpses.
42|Full of corpses?
42|Yeah.
42|Full of dismembered corpses.
42|So we left right away, and ate the lunch she made at a nearby park.
42|I was amazed at how tasty it was. She said her grandma helped to make it.
42|Well, it must have been pretty tough, Araragi-kun.
42|Now that I think about it, I'm sure someone was holding some kind of ritual and killing the snakes like that.
42|After all, it was at a shrine.
42|Did you know there was a shrine there, Hanekawa?
42|Yeah, the Kita-Shirahebi Shrine.
42|Snake, huh. That means...
42|Yeah, it seems that it's there to worship a snake god.
42|I don't really know that much about it, either.
42|Killing snakes at a shrine for a snake god...
42|It's gotta be some kind of ritual.
42|I guess I'd better tell Oshino about it.
42|That's not what I was talking about, Araragi-kun. I meant it was tough for Kanbaru-san.
42|A-b-o-u-t K-a-n-b-a-r-u-s-a-n.
42|I said it must have been tough for her.
42|For Kanbaru? Yeah, I guess.
42|After all, she did get sick all of a sudden.
42|I wonder why.
42|Oh well, I'm glad it was nothing serious.
42|That's not what I meant. Should you be getting that friendly with your girlfriend's junior?
42|It's nice to get along, but walking hand-in-hand is pushing it.
42|I had to. She's touchy-feely.
42|You think she'll take that for an excuse?
42|Well, uh...
42|Come on, Senjougahara said it herself.
42|"I won't let you be rude to my junior."
42|Senjougahara told me to help her out too.
42|I see. Kind of like this?
42|Here you go.
42|Like that, right?
42|Like you were just a breadth away. Right, Araragi-kun?
42|What are you talking about?
42|You're pretty waffly, Araragi-kun.
42|You're kind to everyone, aren't you?
42|That has to be kind of disturbing to Senjougahara-san.
42|Disturbing?
42|She doesn't want you getting along too well with Kanbaru-san, does she?
42|Am I right? Getting along is fine. If anything, she wants the two of you to get along,
42|but she wants a clear line to be drawn.
42|It seems that she wants to be sure you'd pick her out of the two of them.
42|I don't get it.
42|It's a dilemma for her too, isn't it?
42|You're her dear boyfriend, but Kanbaru-san is her dear junior.
42|Oh well, she's a tsundere, so I don't think you should try to understand everything she does.
42|You've got to figure out what she really means.
42|If she's that dear to you, you've got to resist your temptations too.
42|Being kind to everyone is a bit irresponsible.
42|I'll take those words to heart.
42|By the way, Hanekawa. Where are you going to college?
42|Tokyo, right? Or are you studying overseas?
42|I'm not going to college.
42|You're not going to college?!
42|After I graduate, I'm going on a trip.
42|A trip?!
42|I figure I'll take a couple years off and see the world.
42|I've got plenty of knowledge.
42|I think I should get some real-life experience too.
42|Don't tell the teachers yet, okay?
42|If you do, they'll be shocked.
42|I think they'll be more than just shocked.
42|Ow!
42|What's wrong?
42|I just have a little headache.
42|Headache?
42|Yeah, I'm fine.
42|Lately, I've just been getting headaches suddenly.
42|Hey, that's not fine.
42|I'll walk you home.
42|No, I'm fine. I'm not going home.
42|Oh, right.
42|Anyway, sorry, but I'm leaving.
42|Later then.
42|Sengoku?
42|This is...
42|Hey, Kanbaru? Mind giving me a hand?
42|So what do you need?
42|Do you remember the girl we saw on these stairs yesterday?
42|Yeah, she was a cute little thing.
42|I think I recognize her from somewhere.
42|I figured it out when I saw her at the bookstore earlier.
42|I think she's an old friend of my youngest sister.
42|What?!
42|So she's at the shrine again today?
42|Yeah, I think.
42|I need you to, uh...
42|It's tough to go up to an old acquaintance and say hi.
42|She might not remember me, so it'll seem like a creepy pickup line.
42|The self-defense instincts of an adolescent girl are pretty fearsome.
42|You sound like you know that from experience.
42|Can't deny that.
42|And you seem like you're pretty good with younger girls, Kanbaru.
42|After all, you're the school's top star.
42|I see. I get what you mean.
42|I guess I am pretty good with younger girls.
42|You sure are.
42|I'm glad I asked you.
42|If you put it that way, of course I'm glad to help.
42|But you've taken what happened yesterday into account, haven't you?
42|Well, I guess.
42|So that's how it is.
42|Well, well.
42|Sengoku!
42|Stop it, Sengoku!
42|Koyomi Onii-chan...
42|Friends.
42|Sengoku Nadeko, class 2-1.
42|I don't have many friends. But Bara-chan plays with me.
42|When Bara-chan asked me to play, I was really happy.
42|Bara-chan has an older brother in sixth grade.
42|Her big brother's name is Koyomi.
42|Come right in.
42|This room's changed.
42|Yeah, it's set up for single person now.
42|My sisters are in the same room as before.
42|I think they'll be home soon. Want to see them?
42|So this is Araragi-senpai's room?
42|This is the first time I've been in a boy's room.
42|All right, time to look for the porno mags.
42|That kind of thing only happens when a guy goes over to another guy's place!
42|Just sit over there, okay?!
42|It's useful to know your fetishes.
42|It's not just useless for me, it's actually harmful.
42|Yeah, that's what I mean. Harmful books.
42|You're a live specimen of a harmful book!
42|Either sit there, or jump out the window.
42|Make a choice, Kanbaru!
42|I figured out your fetishes when I was stalking you before.
42|I know exactly what kind of porn you've been buying lately.
42|What? No way?!
42|There was no one at all in the store back then!
42|I made sure of it!
42|You've got pretty pervy kinks!
42|You've made your choice. Out the window with you!
42|Most girls would rather jump out the window than do that !
42|But of course, I can do it easily and casually.
42|You're showing off!
42|Koyomi Onii-chan. And Kanbaru-san.
42|Can you turn around for a second?
42|It's fine now. You can turn back around.
42|Bloomers?
42|I gave her those. I keep them around to wear from time to time.
42|Oh, you wear bloomers from time to time?
42|It's only natural for a lady to have this kind of interest.
42|No, it's just like a pervert.
42|It's not like I don't understand why Sengoku doesn't want to stand there in her panties, but bloomers ?
42|What's she doing?
42|They look like scars from bondage.
42|There are scale marks.
42|A fish? No, these are reptilian... A snake!
42|Koyomi Onii-chan.
42|You're all grown up, so you won't feel dirty looking at my body, right?
42|Of course!
42|Right, Kanbaru?
42|You're forgetting something, Araragi-senpai.
42|In a situation like this, it's even ruder to tell a girl you're not interested in her body at all.
42|I see.
42|Let me correct myself. I feel a little bit dirty looking at your body.
42|Come on, Kanbaru! I did what you said, and it made her cry!
42|Who do you think you are, playing it straight like that?
42|Hey, Sengoku.
42|I... I hate my body!
42|Sengoku...
42|I hate it! Please save me, Koyomi Onii-chan!
42|I'm Karen!

42|I let out a belated shout
42|at the state of
42|Sengoku Nadeko's skin.
42|All of her skin was covered with scale marks. From the tips of her toes up to her collarbone.
42|Snugly.
42|For a moment, I thought they were growing from her skin, but upon closer inspection, they weren't.
42|They were simply pressed
42|on, like a woodcut--
42|It looked as though her skin had been pressed into a pattern.
42|It looked like she was even
42|bleeding internally here and there.
42|Those painful-looking scars made her look like she had been bound with rope.
42|No--
42|Bondage scars?
42|Seriously, it was from the tips of her toes, up her legs, and along her body-- It was like something was coiling itself around her.
42|Something
42|invisible.
42|Scale marks, all over her body.
42|Coiled
42|around her.
42|Coiled... as if she were possessed.
42|Coil
42|At best, the only areas without the scale marks were both her arms, and from her neck up. No need to get her to show me what her waist and lower abdomen look like underneath those bloomers.

43|Snake Constrictor.
43|It has to be a Snake Constrictor, Araragi-kun.
43|Adder Shackle, Serpent Braid, Snake Constrictor.
43|Some even call it the Viper.
43|Viper? So it's a snake.
43|Oshino, what kind of oddity is a Snake Constrictor?
43|An oddity born from a person's spite.
43|Well... it's not limited to spite.
43|But since it's a Snake Constrictor, it has to be spite.
43|Sengoku told me about it.
43|She was cursed by a friend from her class.
43|Well, it was something like a hocus pocus spell.
43|Snake Constrictors aren't something an amateur could handle.
43|First of all, why did her friend curse her?
43|It was caused by some kind of love affair.
43|The guy her friend liked confessed to Sengoku,
43|but she unknowingly rejected him.
43|Then her friend ended up resenting her for it... Something like that.
43|After Sengoku found out she was cursed, she went on to read "The Encyclopedia of Snake Curses".
43|Then she figured out how to lift the curse, and performed the ritual.
43|Killing snakes to lift a snake curse sounds pretty dumb.
43|Actually, it got worse after she started killing the snakes.
43|No, Araragi-kun.
43|Chopping up snakes to repel the Snake Constrictor isn't wrong.
43|Actually, you can call it the correct method.
43|Then why...
43|The procedure wasn't carried out correctly.
43|Lifting a curse is harder than placing a curse.
43|Of course it's going to get worse if done by someone with half-assed knowledge.
43|And it seems that she was pretty unlucky.
43|I'm home.
43|Welcome home, Koyomi onii-chan.
43|How did it go, Araragi-senpai?
43|It seems her curse will be lifted if we use this.
43|Really?
43|Yeah, those scale marks will be gone too.
43|But to lift the curse, we have to carry out the ritual at that shrine.
43|It'd be best if we carry it out tonight...
43|Sengoku, is it okay for you to go home late tonight?
43|Yeah, it's okay.
43|I'll call my mom and tell her I'll be staying over at my friend's tonight.
43|We need to prepare a few things for the ritual.
43|I'll go gather those.
43|Meanwhile, go call your mom.
43|Oh, the stuff we need might be a little heavy...
43|Kanbaru, I want you to come and help me.
43|All right.
43|Sengoku is in danger.
43|Her life will be in danger if we don't do something by tonight.
43|The Snake Constrictor is an invisible snake, which is constricting Sengoku's body.
43|The scale marks prove that.
43|According to Oshino, it'll be too late to do anything once the scale marks reach her face.
43|Shouldn't being constricted feel painful?
43|Oshino said it should be painful.
43|But she's probably just holding it in.
43|But Sengoku's classmate didn't have to go this far just because Sengoku rejected the guy she likes...
43|Well, curses themselves aren't a big deal.
43|Well, it shouldn't have activated since it was placed by an amateur.
43|Then why...
43|The procedure to lift the curse wasn't carried out correctly.
43|And also, she was unlucky.
43|The shrine where the young lady chopped up snakes isn't a special place.
43|But you see, Shinobu-chan came to this city.
43|A legendary vampire with royal blood flowing inside her.
43|Not to mention, vampires are the king of all oddities.
43|Because of her, a lot of unwelcome guests began gathering at that shrine.
43|That's also the reason why you didn't feel well.
43|Then...
43|Yeah, the curse was activated because she was killing snakes in that shrine.
43|Nothing would've happened if she did it somewhere else.
43|That's like putting salt on your own wound...
43|Then Araragi-senpai...
43|Wouldn't it be dangerous to carry out the ritual at the shrine?
43|Not really. If we follow the procedure carefully,
43|that place should make its existence stand out.
43|So it's actually to our advantage.
43|Hey, Sengoku...
43|What is it, Koyomi onii-chan?
43|Those scale marks actually hurt, right?
43|Are you okay?
43|W-Well... Please don't be mad at me, Koyomi onii-chan.
43|No, I'm not blaming you.
43|I'm just wondering if you're okay.
43|It feels like I'm being constricted, but I can hold in the pain.
43|It's weird that you have to hold it in.
43|It's okay to say it hurts when it hurts.
43|Yup, he's right.
43|Restraining yourself for a little while is fine,
43|but restraining yourself for a long time isn't because it'll put a lot of stress on your body.
43|I don't understand why you thought restraining yourself is fine
43|and why you ignored the psychological effects of it, Kanbaru.
43|Let's go.
43|By the way, Sengoku...
43|Yes?
43|I was wondering why you rejected the guy who confessed to you.
43|Well...
43|I like someone else.
43|Hey, how much do you remember about our childhood, Koyomi onii-chan?
43|To be honest, not too much.
43|My memory isn't really that good.
43|Oh, I see...
43|I'm surprised that you remembered me at all.
43|I didn't really play with others back then.
43|Rara-chan was the only friend who I could play with after school.
43|You mean Tsukihi-chan?
43|But then, Rara-chan went to a different middle school.
43|I still cherish those memories of us playing together.
43|I see.
43|Not to mention, I'm an only child.
43|I really wanted an older brother.
43|Kanbaru, do you feel okay?
43|I came prepared.
43|I'm feeling better than I expected.
43|Then let's start the preparations.
43|Kanbaru, I did ask you to get her clothes that would leave enough skin exposed
43|so we could see the scale marks go away...
43|But why a school swimsuit of all things?!
43|I was trying to go along with your fetishes.
43|Don't do that!
43|So you admit it's a fetish of yours?
43|Sit right in the middle of the sheet.
43|Then grip this charm with all your might,
43|close your eyes, regulate your breathing and start praying.
43|Pray to what?
43|Whatever you want.
43|But in this kind of situation, you should...
43|All right.
43|I'll try my best.
43|Koyomi onii-chan, look at me.
43|All right.
43|Please look at me.
43|Yeah, no problem.
43|Look at me, Koyomi onii-chan!
43|T-That's...
43|That's not true.
43|Even though you're a sixth grader, you're not scary at all.
43|And you're not mean... Besides...
43|You're really kind...
43|And you fixed my bike!
43|That's...
43|Not true...
43|Rara-chan, I'm so envious that you have such a nice older brother.
43|U-Umm...
43|C-Can I call you... "Koyomi onii-chan"?
43|Huh?
43|Seems like it's turning out okay.
43|But think about it, Araragi-senpai.
43|You owe Oshino-san another favor.
43|It's gonna be a big one too, since the oddity this time was so strong.
43|Nah, I don't owe him for this.
43|Kanbaru, I told you this was a gathering place for unwelcome guests, right?
43|Well, it might've turned into a full-scale war between monsters, so it's very dangerous.
43|We've prevented it by placing an ofuda on this shrine.
43|Was it really that big of a deal?
43|Yeah.
43|He said that charm was a thank you gift.
43|The ritual sure takes a long time.
43|Yeah, but we can only wait.
43|Araragi-senpai, Sengoku-chan must be really tired.
43|Can't we just pull off that Snake Constrictor in one go?
43|Oshino said I could touch the Snake Constrictor and pull it off.
43|You better not do that.
43|If you do that, the Snake Constrictor will obviously try to bind to you.
43|And...
43|Even if I can avoid that,
43|the Snake Constrictor will go back to the classmate who placed the curse.
43|"Curses, like chickens, come home to roost," huh?
43|Yeah.
43|"Curses, like chickens, come home to roost."
43|Araragi-kun, I'm repeating myself, but remember this phrase and think about its meaning.
43|I don't know what goes on in your mind.
43|But one day, I'll leave this city.
43|When that happens, I won't be able to help you anymore.
43|You know, oddities aren't things you should get involved with on purpose.
43|But you have a tendency to stick your nose into the business of others.
43|But I can't just ignore them!
43|I just can't.
43|Then why don't you just forget everything like Class Rep-chan.
43|Forget about everything...
43|I guess that's a bit too hard for you.
43|Well, just relax.
43|We're like brothers now, so I won't just disappear without telling you.
43|I'm an adult, so I at least know to do that.
43|But give some thought to that when you think about your future.
43|Are you saying I'm an irresponsible person for helping whoever I can?
43|But you know, I can't become someone like you.
43|I'm a tenth of a vampire, thus I'm an oddity myself.
43|I can't become someone who exorcises oddities.
43|Araragi-kun.
43|Araragi-kun, you just have to abandon Shinobu-chan and you'll revert back to being entirely human.
43|I don't want you to forget about that.
43|Araragi-senpai!
43|Wh-What happened?
43|I-I don't know, but she suddenly...
43|Did it fail?
43|Is that what happened, Araragi-senpai?
43|No, that can't be...
43|I see!
43|Kanbaru, I made a mistake.
43|If we could actually see the Snake Constrictors, we would've understood right away.
43|What do you mean?
43|There isn't just one...
43|There are two!
43|Dammit!
43|Kanbaru, stay back!
43|Sengoku's friend wasn't the only one who resented her...
43|Sengoku!
43|The guy who Sengoku rejected also began to hate her.
43|Even though I can't see it...
43|I should be able to touch it!
43|This might work.
43|Even though I can't see the Snake Constrictor,
43|I can see its movement path clearly.
43|Using the traces on the ground and the movement of the grass,
43|I can predict where it is.
43|Huh?
43|Araragi-senpai, forgive me!
43|K-Kanbaru...
43|Stay calm! Don't get excited!
43|The poison will spread if you become excited!
43|Snakes are violent creatures, but they're also cowards!
43|If we stay calm and wait, it'll run away.
43|But Kanbaru!
43|Then the snake will go back to the guy whom Sengoku rejected!
43|Araragi-senpai, I'm begging you!
43|Don't be mistaken with whom you're supposed to save...
43|It's too late.
43|Even if I wanted to go after it,
43|chasing an invisible snake is impossible.
43|Araragi-senpai...
43|I'm sorry for making you play such a harsh role.
43|Sorry.
43|Don't apologize, it'll embarrass me.
43|I'm sorry.
43|I'm sorry, Kanbaru...
43|I'm really sorry.
43|The snake went back to the one who placed the curse.
43|In order to take the curse back.
43|Koyomi onii-chan...
43|Kanbaru's conclusion was correct.
43|As a mock oddity myself, I couldn't handle real oddities.
43|But I couldn't give up.
43|Koyomi onii-chan, thanks for saving me.
43|Please don't say that, Sengoku.
43|Don't thank me.
43|I don't have the right to be thanked.
43|Because I tried to save the person who cursed you.
43|I'm Karen!
43|I'm Tsukihi!
43|Just kidding, I'm actually Tsukihi!
43|Just kidding, I'm actually Karen!
43|We switched just in case!

43|Silence / Thought
43|Snake.
43|The general name for reptiles of class Reptilia, order Squamata, suborder Serpentes.
43|They are distinguished by their long, thin, cylindrical body and coat of scales. Having hundreds of vertebrae, they can curve their body at will.
43|Demons, cats, crabs, snails, monkeys-- and now snakes?
43|Leaving out demons, snakes have the worst image of them all. They feel so unlucky.
43|The creepiness of cats, crabs, snails, and monkeys doesn't begin to compare to them.
43|"No-- That image of them is correct, Araragi-kun."
43|"Since long ago, snakes have often been considered as such."
43|"On the other hand, there have been more than a few instances when they've been considered the opposite, and snake cults have been founded --These have occurred all over the world. Something with an image of both holiness and wickedness--That's snakes."
43|"Say what you will, I don't have anything but bad images of snakes."
43|"Even if you mention snake cults, I don't really get it."
43|"How about the tsuchinoko as an image that's not negative?"
43|"Well, for me, the fear of snakes is instinctual rather than logical."
43|"Just looking at them makes me twitch."
43|"Well, there aren't many land animals that look like that."
43|Struggle
43|"They look almost like fish swimming on land, so it's impossible to not find them odd."
43|"And they're unusually good survivors. They don't die easily, even if you try hard at killing them."

44|Ending
44|10-B
44|It was April 29th,
44|the first day of Golden Week.
44|So now, my stepfather's new wife is my mom,
44|and her new husband is my dad.
44|So you mean that your current parents aren't your real parents?
44|Aren't they supposed to not tell you that kind of thing?
44|They were frank with me. I heard about it before I even started school.
44|It was like I was just a nuisance.
44|Even if they wanted to give me up for adoption, they had to keep up appearances.
44|That's why I decided to be a good girl.
44|Being a "good girl" is just being normal, right?
44|I'd be looked at with prejudice because of my complicated family life, right?
44|I decided I wasn't going to let that affect me.
44|Hanekawa...
44|What are you going to do, Araragi-kun?
44|It's finally Golden Week. Aren't you going to study?
44|It's finally Golden Week, so why do I have to study?
44|I go for walks on my days off, since I don't want to be at home.
44|The thought of spending all day at home... It makes me shiver.
44|So I go for walks on my days off.
44|I feel you think too hard about it.
44|Hey, what's up with your face?
44|Promise you won't tell anyone?
44|I promise.
44|My dad hit me this morning.
44|He hit you?
44|That's...!
44|Come on, think about it, Araragi-kun.
44|If a kid you didn't know started acting all familiar with you,
44|don't you think you'd be angry or get rough?
44|Come on!
44|Should you really be justifying it!?
44|You shouldn't forgive that kind of thing!
44|It's fine. He only did it once.
44|Plus, you promised me.
44|You promised me that you wouldn't tell anyone.
44|But...
44|I can't keep that kind of promise.
44|Please, Araragi-kun!
44|Don't tell anyone about this!
44|I'll do anything for you if you keep it secret!
44|Please!
44|Fine, I understand.
44|Huh?
44|Will you help out?
44|Koyomi onii-chan, I've been waiting!
44|Hey, Sengoku!
44|What are you doing here?
44|Um, Koyomi onii-chan...
44|I wanted to thank you again.
44|You should go thank Kanbaru instead.
44|Kanbaru came through here already, right?
44|But before I was able to call out to her, she took off faster than the eye could see.
44|I'm sure that she was just in a hurry to get somewhere.
44|Like a delivery worker.
44|Why are you referring to the special attack of Prince Yamato from Bikkuriman!?
44|It's hard to understand and it takes too long to explain!
44|I didn't think anyone would find it funny either.
44|You're always so funny, Koyomi onii-chan.
44|But what should I do?
44|What's wrong?
44|I had other things to talk to her about too.
44|Really?
44|I'll do that for you.
44|I've got to thank her, too.
44|It'd make me feel bad.
44|Don't say that. It's nothing.
44|Leave it to me.
44|Really? Can you do it for me?
44|Here!
44|I made her clothes nice and clean, so give them to her if you don't mind, okay?
44|Sure.
44|Yeah, sure.
44|That's right, Sengoku.
44|Mind if I ask you something?
44|What would you like to know?
44|It's not a big deal. I'm just curious about Shinobu.
44|Shinobu?
44|Remember how after dealing with the Snake Constrictor yesterday,
44|we went and stayed overnight at an abandoned night school since it was so late?
44|She was the cute little blonde there.
44|Did she tell you anything while I was gone?
44|Nope.
44|I see.
44|She's a vampire, right?
44|Yeah.
44|Well, she's more like a pseudo-vampire now.
44|So she's the one who turned you into a vampire?
44|It's not her fault. It's mine.
44|Besides, it's wrong to blame the oddities.
44|That's just how they are.
44|They have their reasons.
44|That's all there is.
44|I see.
44|Oh well, don't trouble yourself with it.
44|You should go back to your everyday life.
44|Well, come see me if anything happens.
44|If you're really in trouble, you'll get help faster going to Oshino.
44|R-Really?
44|Well, he did warn me about it.
44|We can't just keep relying on him.
44|If we leave everything to Doraemon's secret gadgets, we'll be just like Nobita.
44|That's right.
44|Oshino-san's charm was really just like one of Doraemon's secret gadgets.
44|They're like the genius helmet and the craft glove!
44|Why are you referring to the minor stuff that only shows up in the movies?
44|Use the take-copter or the anywhere door as examples!
44|You're really good at references, Koyomi onii-chan.
44|What is it?
44|What do you mean?
44|When I do it with you, it feels like you're judging me as a man.
44|Nah, it's nothing.
44|By the way, Koyomi onii-chan.
44|What?
44|I was wondering about Shinobu.
44|Shinobu?
44|She kept staring at me.
44|Her eyes are completely different when she looks at you or Oshino-san
44|than when she looks at me or Kanbaru-san.
44|You mean she looks at men and women differently?
44|I'm pretty sensitive, so I noticed.
44|Is that you, Araragi-kun?
44|What are you doing there?
44|Umm...
44|Oh, Hanekawa. This is the girl I was talking about yesterday.
44|S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-Sorry!
44|That kind of stings, Araragi-kun.
44|Umm. She's Sengoku Nadeko, my sister's friend whom I was telling you about yesterday.
44|Oh, that's right, Araragi-kun. Umm...
44|What happened to the snake after that?
44|It's been dealt with for now.
44|Oshino ended up helping us out again.
44|I don't really get what happened, but I guess you it got cleared up quickly.
44|Yeah, I guess.
44|She was pretty cute.
44|That's your middle school's uniform, right?
44|You really do know everything.
44|I don't know everything, I just happen to know this.
44|By the way, Araragi-kun.
44|What?
44|Didn't you say that you were doing something today?
44|Don't tell me it was to talk with a cute middle scho-
44|That's not it.
44|It was about Senjougahara.
44|I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed.
44|Senjougahara-san, eh?
44|I'll tell you some interesting gossip.
44|What? It sounds pretty dull, but I'll listen.
44|Senjougahara has been acting funny ever since she got friendly with you.
44|You're a bad influence on Senjougahara.
44|That kind of thing.
44|Hoshina-sensei asked me about it earlier.
44|"Hanekawa, do you know anything about this?"
44|I don't really understand why you two are into each other.
44|But I'm sure that people will keep on saying that kind of thing.
44|Yeah, they will.
44|And it'll be tough.
44|You have to prove that it's not like that.
44|Senjougahara-san won't like it if you ruin her reputation by having people say she's no good as she's hooked up with you.
44|Yeah, you're right.
44|But I stood up for you. I told him "no way."
44|Really? Thanks.
44|But do you really think that?
44|That there's no way?
44|Yeah, of course!
44|I don't lie.
44|You're the only person I've ever heard say that who isn't lying.
44|Oh?
44|I'm sure a lot of people do.
44|It's the other way around. I think Senjougahara-san is improving.
44|I don't know whether it's because she's feeling better or it's because of you.
44|You've got to support this change in her.
44|You sure don't talk like a high schooler.
44|Really? I think it's normal.
44|Oh.
44|By the way, I wonder if Hanekawa has anyone like that.
44|She's kind to everyone, but I wonder if there's someone special.
44|Hey, Hanekawa.
44|What?
44|What is it, Araragi-kun?
44|Well, umm...
44|How about Doraemon's secret gadgets?
44|Ow!
44|Hey, are you okay?
44|Yeah, I'm fine.
44|But...!
44|You worry too much.
44|Hanekawa, don't tell me...
44|It's happening again, like it did during Golden Week?
44|Golden Week. The nine days between April 29th and May 7th.
44|Hey, Hanekawa!
44|It hurts!
44|Hanekawa!
44|She was charmed by a cat.
44|A meddlesome cat.
44|Meddlesome cat?
44|Yes. Perhaps a whitecat.
44|No, it's usually a meddlesome cat.
44|A tailless cat.
44|A cat whose tail you can't pull.
44|What does that mean, Oshino?
44|Putting it realistically, a multiple personality disorder.
44|It's a form given to the Class Rep's hidden personality.
44|A dark, evil Hanekawa Tsubasa.
44|Let's call it Black Hanekawa.
44|But she's so white.
44|It's not about how she looks, it's about what's inside.
44|What's wrong, Araragi-kun?
44|You're more impatient than you usually are.
44|You weren't this irritated when you were attacked by a demon over spring break.
44|So how do I return Hanekawa back to normal?
44|Don't sweat it. I'll explain the whole thing.
44|There's a reason for the Black Class Rep, the meddlesome cat, appearing.
44|That reason is stress.
44|Stress?
44|It's gotta be some pretty serious stress.
44|Pretty major stress that's added up over the years.
44|Araragi-kun, is there anything the Class Rep has been stressing about?
44|Love? Schoolwork?
44|Or maybe family.
44|Black Hanekawa attacked the townspeople indiscriminately, night after night.
44|By doing so, she relieved Hanekawa's stress.
44|The meddlesome cat's special ability as an oddity is to drain energy.
44|Like what you see in video games. It completely sucks away the touched person's strength and vitality.
44|That energy drain was enough to put people in the hospital.
44|Two patients entered the hospital.
44|The two who became most ill were the first afflicted.
44|And these two were the reason for Hanekawa's stress.
44|Her parents.
44|And on the last day of Golden Week, May 7th.
44|Hey human, I've caught you.
44|I don't know what you're trying to do following me around,
44|but you're wasting your time, meow~
44|As long as the Mistress is still stressed, I'm not going anywhere.
44|By the way, meow~ If you don't deal with it within a year...
44|Shinobu.
44|No, back then her name wasn't Shinobu yet.
44|Her special ability as a vampire is to drain energy, the same as a meddlesome cat.
44|But meddlesome cats and vampires are completely different kinds of oddities.
44|The incarnation of Hanekawa's stress was a meddlesome cat.
44|It was removed thanks to Shinobu's energy drain.
44|Hanekawa's stress was dealt with for the moment.
44|That solved the problem.
44|It's not the same as how she was complaining about strange pains during Golden Week.
44|But...!
44|Hey, Hanekawa!
44|I told you, I'm fine.
44|The nurse's office... No, he wouldn't be there now. How about the hospital?
44|I told you, I'm fine. Stop exaggerating things, Araragi-kun.
44|But hasn't this been happening to you a lot?
44|I told you, you worry too much.
44|You're pretty timid, Araragi-kun.
44|But you're...!
44|Well, I guess you're kind.
44|More importantly, do you understand Senjougahara-san better?
44|And you've got to put it into practice too.
44|Sure, got it.
44|Sorry for making you worry about my problems.
44|I don't mind.
44|Anyway, you should show me that you understand what I'm saying.
44|What?
44|The bloomers and the school swimsuit that you're clutching like they're your treasure.
44|You should probably put them in your bag.
44|I'm Karen!
44|I'm Tsukihi!
44|Preview puzzle!
44|Puzzle!?
44|What's the difference between a puzzle and a quiz?
44|Puzzles are tricky. Quizzes are hard.
44|Yeah, they're hard.
44|They're tricky.
44|Next time, Tsubasa Cat Part 2!
44|It's the last TV episode.
44|It's so sudden!
44|It's better to back off now while there's still time
44|Before we misunderstand each other even more
44|Before I knew it,
44|The staple you used to bind your words pierced my heart
44|It's your fault
44|Don't come to me the way I am now
44|Don't look at me wherever I go
44|Don't let go of me with that smile
44|No matter who you are
44|I prayed for an endless eternity
44|In the sky that stretches on forever
44|Like the sea with its harsh love,
44|You dove into my heart to take it
44|I want to deliver these feelings to you

44|Hanekawa Tsubasa is,

44|She's irreplacable.
44|I owe her.
44|N o ,
44|I owe her
44|a lot.
44|Whatever I do, I don't think it's possible to repay her.
44|Hanekawa
44|Tsubasa.
44|A girl with fantastic wings.
44|A class rep among class
44|reps, chosen by God.
44|She's well-received by the school, and popular among the class.
44|Not only was she honest, but
44|she had a helpful personality too.
44|This might not be the right way to put it,
44|but I couldn't believe what I learned about
44|her family background during Golden Week.
44|Golden Week----
44|The nine days between April 29th and Sunday, May 7th.
44|She was charmed
44|by a cat.
44|She was charmed by a cat like I was attacked by a demon.
44|The oddities have their reasons
44|----In this case, it seems like the family discord and twistedness
44|that Hanekawa felt were that reason.
44|Even still...
44|Pressure
44|Hanekawa reached out her hand to me. She didn't have the time to help me over spring break----but even still, she lifted me up from the deepest depths.
44|I'll never forget that. No matter what happens.

45|We're going on a date.
45|What?
45|Well... Umm...
45|What's with this situation?
45|I've seen similar intimate conversations before in comics and stuff,
45|but somehow I'm not happy at all. If anything, I'm scared!
45|What's wrong, Araragi-kun?
45|Say "ah~".
45|There.
45|Seeing you smile makes me really happy.
45|Araragi-kun, there's a clump of rice on your cheek.
45|You put it there!
45|I'll remove it for you.
45|There you go.
45|Anyway, we're going on a date.
45|No, that's wrong. That's not how it's said.
45|Shall... Shall we go on a date?
45|How... How about we go on a date...?
45|What? Don't you want to, Araragi-kun?
45|No, it's not that I don't want to.
45|I see. Then go on a date with me, Araragi-kun.
45|So in the end, you're that calm.
45|Do you have any complaints... No, any questions?
45|No.
45|I see. Then I'll make up an excuse and go home early after school today.
45|As soon as you're done with the preparations for the cultural festival, come over to my house.
45|Fuck yes!
45|This makes today, June 13th, my first date with my lover.
45|It was a day to remember, but...
45|I spent too much time in front of the school talking to Sengoku and Hanekawa.
45|I'm a little late.
45|Still sooner than I expected.
45|Oh well.
45|All right, let's go. Follow me.
45|Hey...
45|What's wrong, Araragi-kun? You're being pretty quiet.
45|Come on, don't you understand the current situation?
45|I don't understand. What do you mean by "current" and "situation"?
45|You don't even understand that much!?
45|Man, her dad's coming along on our first date.
45|This date is like torture. What kind of hellish memory is it going to be!?
45|It makes sense that you would be nervous on your first date,
45|but don't be, Araragi-kun. The night is long.
45|Yeah...
45|I'm not nervous because it's my first date!
45|Hey, Araragi-kun.
45|Do you love me?
45|Tell me if you love me.
45|What, aren't you going to answer?
45|Could it be that you don't really love me, Araragi-kun?
45|I... I love you.
45|I see. I love you too, Araragi-kun.
45|Thanks a lot.
45|Don't worry about it.
45|You're being really quiet, Araragi-kun.
45|You're not talking at all. Usually you chat a lot more.
45|Is something wrong today?
45|No, I'm fine.
45|Oh, I see. There's something wrong with your head.
45|You're just taking advantage of my confusion to say whatever you want!
45|Araragi-kun, you're always so naughty with your retorts.
45|Very well. Then I'll kindly start the conversation.
45|You can just answer me.
45|What do you love about me?
45|It's pretty obvious what I don't love!
45|Dammit!
45|I was really looking forward to this! It felt like my dreams had come true!
45|Calling it a dream is a hyperbole.
45|Didn't you know, Araragi-kun?
45|If you write "fickle" next to "person"... Hmm I wonder what that makes?
45|She probably means me.
45|Hey, Senjougahara.
45|Just what are you up to?
45|Senjougahara? Are you talking to me?
45|Or are you talking to my father?
45|Daddy, Araragi-kun is talking to you.
45|Hitagi-san! I'm talking to you, Hitagi-san!
45|What, Araragi-kun?
45|But you won't call me by my name. Oh well, I don't really mind.
45|So, Hitagi-san, I'll ask again.
45|Can you tell me what you're up to?
45|What are you scheming?
45|I'm not scheming up anything.
45|By the way, Araragi-kun. There's a famous mystery novelist named Kuroiwa Ruikou,
45|but you can rearrange his name to mean "wicked, bad child".
45|Do you think this was intentional?
45|That doesn't matter! You're the wicked, bad kid!
45|You're saying horrible things about me in front of my father.
45|Daddy, it seems that your daughter is a wicked, bad girl.
45|Oh my, you've gotten quiet again.
45|Perhaps I teased you a bit too much. Araragi-kun, you respond so easily that I dig at you even when I shouldn't.
45|That line cuts the deepest.
45|So, what do you like about me?
45|You're nice, cute, and like a prince who would rescue me whenever I'm in trouble.
45|Well sorry!
45|By the way, Tras- No, I mean Araragi-kun.
45|Did you just call your boyfriend "trash"?
45|What are you talking about? Stop putting words in my mouth.
45|By the way, Araragi-kun. How did you do on the exams?
45|I went through so much trouble, day and night, to study with you at my place.
45|Why do you have to put it like that?
45|So, how did you do?
45|I scored better than I expected.
45|I've always been pretty good at math, but this time I did better than usual.
45|It was because of you. Thanks, Senjougahara.
45|Daddy, I think Araragi-kun is thanking you. Are you listening?
45|Thank you, Hitagi-san!
45|I was hoping that you'd do it right after the exams.
45|Well, expecting that from your current self would be too cruel.
45|I'm a bit surprised even though I was the one who taught you.
45|Surprised?
45|Yes, I see that you don't find it funny.
45|I didn't get your help in order to be laughed at!
45|I was sure that you were going to tell me: "I studied too hard and ended up doing worse than usual."
45|So I'm kind of disappointed.
45|Expecting that to happen is pretty cruel!
45|Oh, I see.
45|But really, your results are a big deal. I'm proud of you.
45|If you keep it up, Araragi-kun,
45|perhaps you can aim even higher.
45|Higher?
45|If you'd like, Araragi-san, I can keep helping you with your studies.
45|Well...
45|I honestly wouldn't mind.
45|I see.
45|Then let's study at my place every day.
45|E-Every day!?
45|Do smart people really study that much?
45|No, it's obviously only necessary for you.
45|Smart people are smart before they even study.
45|But it seems that Hanekawa studies every day.
45|Unfortunately, the studying that Hanekawa-san does is on a completely different level from ours.
45|Hanekawa-san's the real thing. She's in a completely different world.
45|But doesn't Hanekawa-san usually ace all her tests?
45|If Hanekawa-san doesn't ace it, there's probably something wrong with the test.
45|But I wonder.
45|Just how great is the pressure? I honestly can't say I envy her.
45|Pressure, huh?
45|Or you could call it stress.
45|Stress, eh?
45|You don't even begin to compare to her. You have to use all your energy just to crawl up out of the mud.
45|So let's study every day at my place.
45|Sure, thanks.
45|We can do it at Kanbaru's place too sometimes.
45|Why are you talking about Kanbaru now?
45|I have to hang out with her sometime.
45|I promised.
45|Didn't you say you wanted to hang out with her too?
45|Well, she is a pretty fun person.
45|Oh right, about Kanbaru.
45|What about Kanbaru?
45|Why is she so kinky?
45|Kinky? Kanbaru?
45|Am I wrong?
45|Even Oshino said that Kanbaru was more of a kinky character than an athlete.
45|I see. Isn't that just what males see?
45|She's just honest with herself.
45|I see.
45|I can't ignore your mistaken "kinky" impression of my cute junior.
45|If you can't ignore it, what are you going to do?
45|What am I going to do?
45|I'm going to sway the basis for your judgment.
45|If I do that, you'll think of Kanbaru as a pure and innocent girl.
45|Oh... Oh crap!
45|Nibble.
45|How about that, Araragi-kun?
45|Just do whatever you want, Hitagi-san.
45|Wait here a second, Araragi-kun.
45|I'm going ahead by myself to get everything ready.
45|To get everything ready?
45|You should have a chat with my father.
45|Araragi-kun, right?
45|Yes. I'm Araragi Koyomi.
45|I see. Take good care of my daughter.
45|Just kidding.
45|You've probably heard that I'm the very picture of a workaholic.
45|I have barely any time to spend with Hitagi.
45|I don't know if you'd believe me, but it's been a long time since I've seen Hitagi this happy.
45|You heard what happened to her mother, right?
45|Yes.
45|Then you heard about her illness too.
45|Yes.
45|Well, that's not all.
45|Of course, I'm at fault for being so caught up in my work too.
45|Hitagi completely closed off her heart.
45|But lately, she's been asking me things that she hasn't asked me in ages.
45|She said she wanted to help with my work.
45|And this time. Both of her requests involved you.
45|Causing that change in her is pretty impressive, Araragi-kun.
45|I'm thankful that you're that impressed. But it was by accident.
45|Really? I heard that you played a big role in curing Hitagi.
45|I don't think it matters that it was me.
45|And really, Hitagi was saved by herself. I was just present at the time.
45|That's good enough.
45|The most important thing is just being there when you're needed.
45|I didn't do my job as a father.
45|When she needed me, I wasn't there for her.
45|But even if I'm like that, I'm proud of my daughter.
45|I believe in my daughter's judgment.
45|If you're the man she chose, you must be the right one.
45|Take good care of my daughter, Araragi-kun.
45|Father...
45|Sorry to keep you waiting, Araragi-kun.
45|Father, what comes next is between two young lovers.
45|Thanks for bringing us here.
45|We'll be back in around two hours, so go back to work until then.
45|Okay.
45|All right, Araragi-kun.
45|Thanks, Daddy.
45|Hey, Senjougahara. How much longer do I have to stay like this?
45|You're not allowed to look up yet, Araragi-kun.
45|Close your eyes and lie down.
45|You can open your eyes now.
45|How is it, Araragi-kun?
45|Amazing. I honestly don't have any words for it.
45|Your vocabulary isn't big enough.
45|Deneb, Altair, Vega.
45|Those stars make the famous Summer Triangle.
45|And Ophiuchus is straight to the side.
45|So Serpens is over there.
45|That bright star there is Spica.
45|Meaning Virgo is over there.
45|Cancer is over there... It's a little hard to make out.
45|That's all.
45|Huh? What do you mean?
45|That's all I have.
45|Being able to help you study.
45|A cute junior and a brusque father.
45|And this starry sky.
45|That's all I have.
45|That's all I can give you, Araragi-kun.
45|That's everything.
45|Everything...
45|Well, to be exact, I can also offer spiteful and abusive words.
45|I don't want those.
45|And there's my body.
45|Do you not want that either?
45|Uh, no... That...
45|But you know, right? A long time ago, I was nearly raped by a chauvinist pig.
45|Yeah.
45|Honestly, I'm afraid to do with you what he did to me.
45|I'm really afraid that I'll hate you for it, Araragi-kun.
45|Right now, I'm afraid of losing you.
45|Although my life hasn't been very fortunate until now,
45|I'm glad if I caught your eye because of that misfortune.
45|Because of that, I was able to fall for you.
45|So we'll definitely do something, but I want to wait just a little bit.
45|So right now, the last thing I can offer you...
45|Is this starry sky.
45|When I was a little girl, my mommy and daddy took me here.
45|It's my treasure.
45|Hey, Araragi-kun. Do you love me?
45|I love you.
45|I love you too, Araragi-kun.
45|Thanks.
45|What do you love about me?
45|Everything. There's nothing about you I don't love.
45|I see. I'm happy.
45|What do you love about me?
45|You're kind.
45|You're cute.
45|You're like a prince who would rescue me whenever I'm in trouble.
45|I'm happy.
45|By the way, that chauvinist pig was only interested in my body, so he took nothing from my lips.
45|So, Araragi-kun. Kiss me.
45|No, that's wrong. That's not how it goes.
45|Shall... Shall we kiss?
45|H-How... How about we kiss?
45|Let's kiss, Araragi-kun.
45|So in the end, you're that calm.
45|That's how this became a day to remember.
45|For both of us.

45|At least I figured this out.
45|Senjougahara Hitagi...
45|She's pretty smart,
45|usually near the top of the class,
45|but incompetent at love. Completely incompetent.
45|Even during our conversation when we started dating on Mother's Day. This girl is so reckless. She's like an RPG hero who goes straight into a cave without a torch.
45|She's showing all her cards and throwing herself on the mercy of her opponent.
45|Does she think she needs to use that methodology,
45|like an aggressive diplomatic doctrine, in this kind of fond,
45|subtly budding relationship?
45|It's horrible.
45|99 men out of 100 would dump her if she kept pushing it like that.
45|It's scary.
45|I can tell even though I'm not experienced in love either.
45|Well.
45|I guess she's doing it because she's decided I'm that one out of the hundred.
45|I have to tip my hat.
45|Oh no.
45|I'm moeing so damn hard.
45|I can't even joke about it.
45|Really, I just wanted to leave it all up to force and embrace Senjougahara,
45|but even I know I'd lose her then.
45|Even from the start, I never had many cards to play...
45|Is I guess
45|how I'd describe my relationship with Senjougahara.
45|Not that I didn't need them.
45|Sleep
45|Lying there together looking up at the stars. We make good lovers like that.

45|It's your fault
45|Don't come to me the way I am now
45|Don't look at me wherever I go
45|Don't let go of me with that smile
45|No matter who you are
45|I prayed for an endless eternity
45|In the sky that stretches on forever

45|You dove into my heart to take it

45|That's the Summer Triangle you pointed at
45|I remember that when I look up at the sky
45|I finally found Vega
45|But where are you, Altair?
45|You'll be alone like this
45|I looked up from the pitch dark world
45|It's like the night sky is filled with raining stars
45|I wonder when I started to chase after you
45|Please, no matter what
45|Don't be surprised
45|Listen to these feelings of mine

46|恋しくて 愛しくて 止まらない
46|せめて この心は
46|君のもとへ...
46|Hachikuji!
46|It's been a long time!
46|How cute, how cute!
46|Must touch more, must hug more!
46|Let's check your panties, come on, come on!
46|Ouch!
46|What the hell are you doing?!
46|It's alright, it's alright! I'm not your enemy!
46|Right, calm down, breathe slowly.
46|You breathe like some kind of superman robot.
46|It's me. Look closely!
46|If it isn't Muraragi-san!
46|Don't make up names that make people sound like desperate losers!
46|Sorry. I stuttered.
46|Wrong. You did that on purpose.
46|Stutterered.
46|Not on purpose?!
46|Sanctified.
46|What kind of miracle was that?!
46|I see, studying for a test...
46|The first and seventh best students in school are teaching me after all.
46|It's hard to come up with anything which beats that.
46|Hanekawa is that other girl I met before, the one with braided cord?
46|Yup, yup.
46|And Senjougahara's your girlfriend?
46|Right.
46|What's wrong? Do you have any complaints?
46|No, I was just thinking that from those two one would naturally choose Hanekawa.
46|So I'm kind of puzzled with why you chose Senjougahara.
46|Why, you say...
46|Because I just don't see Hanekawa as a girlfriend.
46|She's more like my patron. Hanekawa would probably reject me herself too.
46|Besides, in the first place I liked Senjougahara as she is, her personality included...
46|Well, if you're saying you like Senjougahara better, then I guess that's how it is.
46|Like they say, people's tastes are separately discriminated.
46|Maybe distinctively separated after all?!
46|By the way, Araragi...
46|That vampire girl... I think her name was Shinobu Oshino, right?
46|Yeah.
46|She's about eight years old, blonde, and with a helmet and goggles, right?
46|Yeah. So what?
46|I can't say for sure because I didn't get to take a close look,
46|but I think I saw her yesterday.
46|She was alone by a donut shop along the highway around five in the evening.
46|Donut shop?
46|Does Oshino let her wander around alone?
46|Yeah, that's what I thought too.
46|I decided it's better to report this, so I set up an ambush on you.
46|Oh, really?
46|You should have said so in the first place.
46|Well excuse me.
46|I was so shocked when a certain lolicon grabbed me that I forgot about it.
46|Oh really?
46|Heh, sorry for letting your imagination run wild.
46|No, I'm glad I can be of use to you.
46|Moreover, isn't it time?
46|Oh, yes.
46|See you later, Hachikuji.
46|Yes. I'm sure we will meet again.
46|Oh.
46|Where're you off to, Araragi?
46|I need to go somewhere for a while.
46|What for?
46|Humanitarian aid.
46|I see.
46|That's fine. Take care, Araragi.
46|I'm especially sympathetic to you, so I'll take attendance for you.
46|Attendance?
46|I'll be fine as long as I use your voice.
46|Leave it to me.
46|My voice actress has a superior voice.
46|Voice actress!? Is this world an anime!?
46|"Hitagi, you are so beautiful!
46|You are really my dream woman! I love you!"
46|Didn't that resemble you?
46|Not at all! You got my hopes up, but this didn't come close to my expectation!
46|To begin with, you haven't even heard that from me yet!
46|"Haven't yet", meaning I'm still going to hear it?
46|...Yeah!
46|Hey, Hanekawa.
46|...Oh, Araragi.
46|Isn't riding a bike into the park against the rules?
46|There's a proper parking place here.
46|This isn't the time to be telling me this!
46|Who cares about parking after you made me skip school!
46|This and that are two different issues. Hurry up and park it.
46|I'm sorry for making you skip school, Araragi.
46|No, it's nothing. Did I sound like I'm complaining?
46|I didn't mean to be sarcastic.
46|You don't have to worry. I've properly calculated it.
46|There's no problem even if you're absent with today's schedule, Araragi.
46|But with the class rep and vice class rep missing, what'll happen to the cultural festival preparations?
46|I've left Senjougahara in charge of it after school.
46|Isn't that a mistake?
46|She skipped school yesterday. So she's paying me back.
46|Still, no matter how you look at it, those are pajamas.
46|Hey, Hanekawa.
46|What?
46|No, Princess Hanekawa.
46|Princess?
46|May I please take your coat?
46|Araragi.
46|Yes.
46|Don't make me angry.
46|I'm sorry...
46|Well, enough with the jokes.
46|What's the matter, Hanekawa?
46|It's those headaches, after all?
46|No, the headaches... have gone away for now.
46|Umm...
46|Araragi... That Golden Week...
46|I remembered it.
46|I see...
46|No, that's not right, I guess.
46|It's like I remembered that I'm forgetting something...
46|I see.
46|The cat.
46|It's the cat.
46|I remembered up to that point.
46|We buried that cat with you, Araragi.
46|Yeah... I remember that now.
46|But Hanekawa, calling me out like that...
46|I guess there's something else to it...
46|Aside from you just remembering something?
46|That's true.
46|Spirits, right?
46|Yes... That's why I thought I'd ask you to guide me to Oshino's place, Araragi...
46|Can I ask you to lead the way?
46|Why of course.
46|Of course, but before that, may I ask you several questions?
46|Sure, why?
46|You see, we're always relying on Oshino regarding spirits.
46|Even if we end up passing it to him again, it's better to sort this out between us first.
46|Ah, you're right.
46|Fine. Well then, ask me anything.
46|You said you're having headaches recently, when exactly did they start?
46|About a month ago, I guess.
46|Yesterday and the day before that happened in front of you,
46|and the ones at the bookstore and the school gates were really painful.
46|Why didn't you say so back then?!
46|Sorry. I didn't want to worry you.
46|...Well, fine.
46|Then... Have you had any cat-related episodes since Golden Week?
46|Cat-related episodes?
46|Like a black cat running in front of you or something along those lines.
46|May twenty-seventh, I was listening to a radio show.
46|They were reading a postcard from someone nicknamed "I love big pandas".
46|Do you think that's related?
46|...No, I think it's not.
46|By the way, this was written in the letter:
46|"It may look quite fun in anime and manga,
46|but being a maid is a surprisingly tough job."
46|"They don't have time to rest at all."
46|"I've been told that on a group date the other day, there's no mistake."
46|No, you didn't have to explain that to me!
46|By the way, Araragi, do you think that postcard is funny?
46|I don't really understand it.
46|Well, you see...
46|The postcard says that maids don't have time to rest at all,
46|but the writer cheekily participates in group dates like it's nothing.
46|That's supposed be funny.
46|...but why should I comment on that postcard?
46|Oh, now I get it.
46|But really, it's hard to get it by listening to it only once.
46|Moreover, now that I think about it,
46|A "bear cat" isn't really a cat at all, it's a panda.
46|Yes, you're right.
46|Anything else?
46|Others?
46|Umm, let's see, at the same show there was someone nicknamed "The brandishing personality".
46|"We played the Millionaire card game with three friends some time ago."
46|"Once we dealt the cards, one of them said:
46|"In my middle school we had the rule that 4 was the strongest card!"
46|Where is the funny part?
46|No, when I said "anything else" I didn't mean "any other postcards you didnt't get".
46|By the way, the funny part was that there are lots of local rules in Millionaire such as "8 doesn't play" or "flee the capital".
46|Their friend was just using that to bring up a rule convenient with the cards he had at hand.
46|Ah, I see now.
46|As expected from Araragi-kun.
46|I'm not glad being appreciated for this.
46|And one more, about that "brandishing personality" nickname...
46|These two words are written with the same kanji, so it's a bit of a pun too.
46|But you know, Araragi-kun,
46|that show isn't only about obscure postcards.
46|Nickname "Let's walk peeling apples".
46|"The other day, I went to a video rental shop with my friend."
46|"We wanted to take a certain drama show,
46|but from the 13 volumes, the eigth was rented by another person."
46|"So we could rent up to the seventh."
46|"I feel like waiting for 8 in a Sevens game!" said my friend."
46|"The guy who rented the eighth one must be grinning now."
46|"But looks like it's him who's going to score the last!" the friend answered."
46|That's fun alright, but let's put that radio aside!
46|Well, anyway, Hanekawa.
46|My next question.
46|Okay.
46|Please take off your hat.
46|That's... That's not a question, is it, Araragi?
46|Yeah.
46|Princess Hanekawa. Please allow me to take care of your hat for the time being.
46|Araragi.
46|Yes.
46|Don't make me angry.
46|Go ahead.
46|If you want to be angry then go ahead and be.
46|To me, repaying the favor is more important than friendship.
46|Repaying the favor... What do you mean by that?
46|I'm talking about the spring vacation.
46|But that's... I mean, in the end...
46|Haven't you been saved only through your own efforts?
46|No. Oshino can say that, but I think that you saved me.
46|You are my savior.
46|I'd like to do anything for you.
46|If only I could do that, I will endure any anger or hatred.
46|Endure, huh?
46|You sound like a brat.
46|Am I?
46|You impudent Araragi, how dare you!
46|That line's more suited for a delinquent.
46|It's not something an honors student would say.
46|That's true.
46|Don't laugh.
46|I-Is this enough?
46|Y-Yeah...
46|Thanks.
46|Why're you thanking me?
46|But... Yeah, I've got it.
46|It really does seem like a continuation of Golden Week.
46|If that is so, we can deal with that.
46|I guess so.
46|Okay, well, let's head to Oshino's.
46|You're not going to lecture me about riding a bike with two people being illegal, are you?
46|I'd like to, but I'll overlook this for you.
46|I made you skip school, but with this, we should be even.
46|Um, isn't that a strange way of being even?
46|Okay, get on.
46|Well then, let's go.
46|So soft!
46|And large!
46|Araragi, we need to talk after we get off the bike.
46|Okay then, we're departing.
46|By the way, you have it pretty tough, you know.
46|Having to look after various people's various problems.
46|Various people?
46|Senjougahara, Mayoi-chan, Kanbaru...
46|And yesterday, Sengoku-chan...
46|They're all girls!
46|Shut up.
46|They're all related to... spirits, right?
46|I've just remembered.
46|It's kind of like they're incomplete though...
46|That's right. It's not like Senjougahara could have gotten over her illness so quickly, right?
46|It all started when you were attacked by the vampire during spring break...
46|Everything stems from that.
46|The spirits themselves have been there all along naturally...
46|It's not like they just popped up all of the sudden one day, right?
46|You know... Araragi?
46|Know what?
46|Vampires have one peculiar ability.
46|It's called "charm"... vampires take humans as love slaves.
46|"Love slaves"?
46|It must be something like hypnosis, I think.
46|You gaze into their eyes and the next moment you fall in love with them.
46|So what?
46|Nothing really. But I just thought...
46|Maybe that you're popular with girls now is somehow related?
46|Sorry. I'm being mean right now, am I?
46|I don't really think so.
46|Rather, I can I understand that.
46|I get it, charm, huh.
46|You know everything, don't you?
46|I don't know everything.
46|I don't... know everything.
46|I know nothing at all.
46|Oh? Is that you, Araragi?
46|And class reppy... right?
46|Your hair's a bit different today,
46|but yeah, those glasses are unmistakenably yours.
46|Long time no see Reppy, one day no see Araragi.
46|Huh? You're not going to say your usual "I've been waiting for so long" or "I got tired of waiting" today?
46|Uhh, oh? Is that so?
46|What's the matter, Reppy?
46|Today's not a weekend.
46|Araragi's one thing, but it pains me to think that Reppy could skip classes too.
46|I see, it must be that.
46|The rumored School Foundation Day.
46|Oh... no.
46|Hm? That hat...
46|Suits you...
46|The hat.
46|...Yes.
46|So that's how it is, Araragi.
46|Troubles really follow your wake.
46|Anyway, come in.
46|Araragi, to tell the truth, I'm unusually occupied with something now.
46|I'm busy and don't have much time.
46|Is that so?
46|But alright. Araragi's one thing,
46|but if Reppy is in serious trouble,
46|I have to at least help her with something.
46|Meddlesome cat.
46|Talking about spirits, you should have heard about the famous three legendary monster cats...
46|I mean, Araragi is one thing,
46|but for Hanekawa it goes without saying.
46|Hey, stop conveniently inserting "Araragi's one thing" when you talk about Hanekawa!
46|Bit by bit, this is starting to annoy me.
46|No, it's not like I was saying it on purpose either,
46|but the truth just slips right out of my mouth, y'know?
46|You better watch out on the road at night.
46|It's pointless to worry, I'm nocturnal.
46|Speaking of nocturnal, cats are like that too.
46|H-Hanekawa?!
46|Don't panic, Araragi.
46|Aren't you lively, did something nice happen?
46|Is it that you got to see her cat ears
46|or that you got to see her in pajamas?
46|Don't add practical conclusions to the lines you say out of habit!
46|This is just asking for misunderstanding!
46|It's no misunderstanding though.
46|Instead, you could have at least said a word of gratitude to me,
46|who never mentioned how you got Hanekawa to embrace you while riding on your bike.
46|It seems you have finished questioning the victim already.
46|The case of a shy girl two days ago was a good punch for you.
46|Sengoku's a "shy girl"?
46|No, before that - what did you do?
46|You have gathered a bit of info without me,
46|but I had almost no chance of doing that.
46|I'm just taking shortcuts.
46|Shortcuts?
46|Told you I have no time, didn't I?
46|Instead of listening to Reppy's story,
46|it's much faster to ask the suspect himself.
46|Suspect?
46|But...
46|Look, it's here already, Araragi.
46|The sexually twisted cat takes her appearance.
46|I'm surprised to see you again, human.
46|Lusting over my master's breasts without any shame, it seems.
46|Hopeless as usual, aren't you.
46|Shall I devour you?
46|I'm Karen!
46|And I'm Tsukihi!
46|Baseball, y'know.
46|Baseball, y'know?
46|Don't you think it's useless complaining about the ump?
46|Isn't it useless?
46|The ump is absolute!!
46|But there's also "appeal play".
46|"Appeal play"?
46|It's when you go, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, Blue, that was an out just now!
46|Don't play dumb. You saw it clearly, right?" and you get an out.
46|A secret plan, right?
46|If you use it poorly you'll be ejected!
46|Ejected, fail!
46|Preview quiz!
46|Quiz!
46|Preview Squeeze!
46|"Squeeze"?
46|Squeeze is the term for a bunt?
46|A bunt?
46|It's a safety squeeze! I don't understand it!
46|Yeah, I don't understand the meaning at all!
46|The bunter's the sacrifice so why is it "safety"!?
46|He's an absolute sacrifice!
46|It's an all-out contradiction!
46|They're trying some subtle deception!
46|It's like "A sacrificial bunt so you can live too"!!
46|That's not a quiz, but a complaint!
46|Next time, Tsubasa Cat Part Four.
46|The gift of a bunt to the runner.
46|Bunt fail.

47|What the heck?
47|Is it during maintenance or something?
47|Nah, it happens way more often.
47|I'm sure you see it on a daily basis, too.
47|On a daily basis?
47|I don't think I've ever seen it.
47|Wait, if that actually happened every day,
47|it'd cause accidents all over the place.
47|It happens every day so that accidents aren't all over the place.
47|You don't get it at all,
47|you fool.
47|Well, you'll see that it's actually a pretty simple thing if I let you in on the secret.
47|From the time a signal turns red,

47|Exactly.
47|You're surprisingly quick on the uptake for how dumb you are, Araragi.
47|Thanks for the compliment.
47|It wasn't one. I was taking a dig at you.
47|People crossing the road when the crosswalk light turns green think they have some kind of divine protection.
47|But they're sorely mistaken, aren't they?
47|It's just half as risky, is all.
47|And it's just a little bit better than every signal being green.
47|The best way to avoid any danger is to not use a crosswalk at all.

47|But if you bring that up...
47|Even if you're using the sidewalk, a drunk driver could zigzag his way across and run into you.

47|Yeah, it's not.
47|But that's exactly why people need to bring these things up.

47|"Why can't we all just get along?"
47|"Kids have the duty to find happiness."
47|It's because people indulge in these drunken ramblings that they get the rug pulled out from under their feet.
47|Kids in warzones have a firmer head on their shoulders, even if they're uneducated.
47|At the very least, they covet their lives more.
47|After all, all they see through their eyes is red signals—not green.
47|Basically, Oumi wanted to tell me that there was a three-second interval where every signal turned red.
47|She wanted to share that trivia with me.
47|Apparently she just wanted to show off and impress me,
47|but going from there to talking about life and its principles
47|was what this fifteen year old girl, Oshino Ougi, was all about.
47|As for me, I recall that little tidbit along with Hachikuji Mayoi.
47|I recall it along with that lost girl.
47|As each signal in the traffic's path glowed red,

47|I'm not a senior citizen.
47|My life started when my sister revived me.
47|Revived?
47|I died once.
47|I died and then came back to life.
47|By the way, Devil Boy,
47|do you know how the two of us are different in that regard?
47|Well, the same goes for that ghost called Hachikuji too.
47|Different?
47|I think we're completely different.
47|We're all former humans,
47|but we each died in our own way.
47|You're immortal.
47|You became immortal when you died.
47|So, strictly speaking,
47|Black
47|Unnumbered Scene
47|you haven't died at all.
47|I, on the other hand, have died.
47|I died for real.
47|And after my death, I came back to life.
47|To be more precise, I've been reborn.
47|Rebirth?
47|As for that ghost girl,
47|she hasn't come back to life.
47|She died and didn't come back to life.

47|That's what it means to be a ghost.
47|She has neither continued to live, nor has she been reborn.
47|She basically stayed dead.
47|Scene no. 187
47|Say, Devil Boy.
47|If you look at it this way, who among us do you think is the happiest?
47|Actually, all three of us should consider ourselves lucky.
47|Even after our deaths, our consciousness stayed alive.
47|We are truly fortunate, if you ask me.
47|Scene no. 191
47|I don't think you can make that statement unconditionally.
47|Have you ever thought about why you were born?
47|I frequently thought about stuff like that back when I was in middle school.
47|I've been trying to figure it out ever since I was born.
47|To be more precise, from the time I died.
47|No, wait. I've been trying to figure it out ever since I was reborn.
47|There must be some meaning behind it all.
47|If not, I get the feeling I shouldn't be here.
47|Or maybe it's more like the significance of my death?
47|I thought that maybe, just maybe, you'd be able to give me an answer.
47|I heard you argued rather fiercely with my sister.
47|Nah, I don't have an answer for that.
47|I don't think Hachikuji does, either.
47|If that's why you asked me how she became a ghost, I mean.
47|That's exactly why I asked.
47|She had her reasons to lose her way in this world.
47|As she ate her ice cream,
47|Scene no. 201
47|she talked about oddities with a blank expression and asked me difficult questions.
47|Scene no. 201
47|The reason she did, or well, the objective she had was already fulfilled more than three months ago.
47|Really?
47|Then why does she stay a ghost?
47|No clue.
47|Okay, then, Devil Boy.
47|The next time you see her, ask her this question for me.
47|Ask her what, exactly?
47|Isn't that obvious?
47|Ask her if she's happy as a ghost.
47|Scene no. 210
47|In the end, I couldn't find Hachikuji.
47|That could only mean one thing.
47|Even though I've had tons of fun conversations with her,
47|I haven't gotten to know her at all.
47|Reference
47|I still haven't asked her the most important question.
47|I'm sure I can't ask her what Ononoki wants me to, either.
47|I can't ask her anything
47|because she won't tell me anything.
47|"What do you wanna do?"
47|"Where do your feelings lie?"
47|"Is there anything at all you want me to do for you?"
47|I want her to answer all these questions, but I haven't asked her yet.

47|you stand to gain nothing by racking your brains over it.
47|What that little girl wants?
47|What she wants to be?
47|It is futile for you to think about it.
47|You shouldn't even ask her that.
47|I shouldn't?
47|It's not like you can do anything about it.
47|Sure, I did say you should just go ahead and fulfill her desires,
47|but you know better than anyone that you can't, right?
47|I'm sure there are other things that require your attention.

47|Hey, Shinobu.
47|What?
47|Do we use that gate to go back too?
47|Y-Yeah, something like that.
47|Why are you being so vague?
47|Well, I didn't put too much thought into how we were going to go back.
47|Wait a second.
47|Shinobu didn't open that gate using her own powers.
47|She used the energy gathered in this shrine to do so.
47|How can you open up that gate or whatever now that you used up all the energy there?
47|Scene no. 362
47|Uh...
47|Hey, wait a second.
47|Please don't tell me we're in a situation where we can't go back.
47|Nah, we're fine!
47|No need to worry, my master.
47|Just think about it.
47|We went back in time to yesterday.
47|I only opened a time tunnel using the spiritual energy gathered in this shrine tomorrow.
47|That means the energy hasn't been used up yet.

47|I can very well open another gate.
47|Wait, wouldn't that cause a time paradox?
47|Using that energy today would mean that we wouldn't be able to make it here from tomorrow.
47|Uh.
47|Scene no. 368
47|She said nothing.
47|She didn't know what to say.
47|Five minutes later
47|Er...
47|Shinobu's opinion
47|Scene no. 369
47|Oh, right! I remember now!
47|Compared to traveling back in time, it takes less energy to travel to the future.
47|We're not going against the flow of time, after all.
47|We're just like salmon in that regard.
47|Scene no. 372
47|So we won't be using that much energy to go back,
47|which will leave enough energy for us to use tomorrow.
47|Scene no. 373
47|Honestly, though, it did make me think.
47|Scene no. 373
47|I thought about the somewhat dangerous implications of time paradoxes.
47|Scene no. 373
47|What type of time warp is this, anyway?
47|Type? What do you mean?
47|There are two broad categories of time warps.
47|Scene no. 376
47|One where the time traveler exists at the destination, and one where he doesn't.
47|Oh. So it's like how your classmates in school see you?
47|Scene no. 378
47|I'm always there!
47|I don't fade in and out of existence!
47|Scene no. 378
47|Basically, I'm asking you if I'll find yesterday's me at home if I go there
47|or if I've already become yesterday's me.
47|Quit dozing off!
47|Red
47|Unnumbered Scene
47|I'm not entirely sure.
47|Why don't you go see for yourself?
47|Go home and take a look at your room.
47|You'll be able to tell which type of time warp this is based on whether you find yourself there or not.
47|I guess you're right.
47|Wait, what?
47|How'd you know what time it is?
47|That watch came from the future.
47|It can't be showing the right time for this time period.
47|No. I adjusted it earlier based on the Sun's position.
47|Not knowing what time it is would be a pain,
47|which is why I borrowed this watch from you.
47|Anyway, let's go back home.
47|Give me a ride on your shoulders, then!
47|Oh god, so cute!
47|She's like a doll!
47|Her hair's so fluffy!
47|Hey, mind if I ask you something?
47|What's today's day and date? Monday, August 21st?
47|What?
47|You're way off!
47|What's today's date, then?
47|What's wrong with you?
47|You sound like you came from the future or something.
47|Today's May 13th.
47|Is what they said.
47|Scene no. 398
47|I'll be damned.
47|Scene no. 398
47|13th of May
47|What year AD is this?
47|Uh...
47|The middle school girls gave me an answer.
47|They said it was eleven years ago from today, or well, what is now the future.
47|Let's feel each other's heartbeat
47|and tell each other of our feelings without lies
47|A normal Friday
47|is part of a series of days full of doubts and regrets
47|I try to think of a plan
47|to tell you of my love, but suddenly the day is over
47|I get so insecure when your eyes drift away
47|I don't want to wind up being super jealous
47|You know, I wish it was just us two
47|Don't laugh at my innocent words of love
47|Like I'd ever give up on you again
47|I desperately look for an answer
47|It's so ridiculous
47|Let's look into each other's eyes
47|discard our fear
47|and try explaining our feelings
47|Let's take a deep breath and try again

48|Araragi-senpai.
48|Did you know there's a moment where every traffic light in an intersection turns red?
48|I recall all of Ougi-chan's words in one go
48|Animation Number 10
48|What's that? When the manufacturer checks it?
48|No no, it happens much more frequently. Even you've seen it on a daily basis, Araragi-senpai.
48|A daily basis? I don't recall seeing anything like that.
48|I mean, if that happened all the time, there'd be traffic accidents all over.
48|They make sure it happens all the time so there won't be traffic accidents all over.
48|You really don't get it. You're such a fool.
48|It's a very simple story when you look behind the scenes.
48|After vertical signals turn red and until horizontal ones turn green...
48|Naoetsu High School
48|...every signal always has a three-second time lag.

48|In other words, everything comes to a halt. You could call it the blank three seconds of an intersection.
48|Conversely, there's never a time when they're all green. Unless a manufacturer was checking things.
48|If I designed it, I'd build a system that couldn't do that at the structural level. Everyone prefers safe over dangerous.
48|Of course. No need to formally announce it.
48|No, allow me to formally announce it. This is a pretty interesting story.
48|When the world is filled with red lights signaling danger, the world is safer than usual.

48|Such a contradiction.
48|Like how healthy food tastes awful, and something that tastes good is basically bad for you and makes you fat?
48|Right. Like that.
48|For someone so unintelligent, you're quick to understand.
48|I'm honored by the praise.
48|Sarcasm, not praise.
48|The world's full of people who think God's watching over them when they cross on green.
48|But in reality, that's not the case at all. It's merely that the risk is cut in half.
48|It's only slightly better than every light being green.
48|If you don't want to face danger, don't cross any crosswalks.
48|You say that, but the possibility of a drunk driver swerving into you on the sidewalk isn't zero either.
48|Correct, that's not zero. But that's all the more reason to say stuff like this.
48|Someone, such as myself, should be saying such things.
48|What a dangerous place this world is.
48|Oh, how the world is peaceful. How it's full of dreams, hopes, and salvation.
48|How people were born to love each other and be friendly.
48|How children are obligated to be happy.
48|Since you're intoxicated in your speech as you blab that stuff, you're easily caught off guard.
48|Children in war zones, even without proper schooling, are more sound.
48|At least, they're more gluttonous about life.
48|In their eyes, all the signals they see are red, not green.
48|In the end, Ougi-chan just wanted...
48|...to teach me some trivia that all intersections have a three-second period where all lights are red.
48|I think she just wants to impress people,
48|but the 15-year-old girl named Oshino Ougi turns such stories into massive tales of life and principles.
48|And I'm reminded of that trivia alongside memories of Hachikuji Mayoi.
48|I'm reminded of those words along with a lost young girl.
48|Every traffic light in the way was red.
48|And the instant she crossed on green, she was run over.

48|I recall it with the memories of that girl who died over 10 years ago.

48|I was human once too.
48|Don't be so surprised. You used to be human yourself, right?
48|No, according to Onee-chan, you're still human, right?
48|Who knows? It's a pretty vague concept.
48|That's what Ononoki suddenly said.
48|Animation Number 159
48|It was quite shocking.
48|Animation Number 159
48|Like getting a confession out of the blue.

48|That's troublesome.
48|I'm a shikigami with quite a bit of original elements that Onee-chan created on her own.

48|Tsukumo-gami? You mean that?

48|...or there's a grudge because its owner tossed it out just shy of 100 years?
48|No?
48|That's pretty much accurate. But I'm a tsukumo-gami of a human.

48|Is
48|Animation Number 168
48|what Ononoki-chan
48|Animation Number 168
48|said so disturbingly.
48|Animation Number 168
48|Then why give me this information?
48|Got a grudge? Don't take your frustration over Shinobu out on me.
48|No,
48|Animation Number 168
48|disturbing
48|Animation Number 168
48|isn't quite right
48|Animation Number 168
48|Then, Ononoki-chan, you're actually over 100, yet look like a kid.
48|Please, I'm not in that 75-and-over bracket.
48|What you'd call my "life" started when Onee-chan revived me.
48|Revived you?
48|Because I've died once already. I died and came back to life.
48|By the way, devil boy, can you tell what the difference between us is, in that sense?
48|Actually, include that ghost girl Hachikuji too.
48|Difference? If you say difference, I think we're completely different.
48|We all used to be human, but died in different ways.
48|In your case, you became immortal. You became immortal the instant you died.
48|Strictly speaking...
48|...you haven't died.
48|I, on the other hand, am dead. Really dead.
48|And am now back alive.
48|It's more correct to say I was reincarnated instead of revived.
48|Reincarnated?
48|And in the case of that ghost girl, she hasn't come back to life.
48|Dead, and staying dead without being revived. I think that's what a ghost is.
48|You don't continue to live and haven't been reincarnated. If anything, she continues to be dead.
48|Hey, devil boy. When you think about it this way, who's the happiest of us?
48|All three of us, in our own ways, are lucky.
48|I think you can say it's fortunate that we continue to be conscious even after death.
48|Can you generalize like that?
48|Have you ever thought about why you were born?
48|I often thought about stuff like that in junior high.
48|I've thought about it since birth. Or more precisely, from the moment I died?
48|No, I've been thinking from the moment I was reincarnated. There has to be some meaning.
48|If there's no purpose, I don't think I belong here.
48|Perhaps it's more about why I died.
48|I thought you might be able to answer that.
48|I heard you stylishly declared your defiance against Onee-chan.
48|No, I can't answer anything like that. And I don't think Hachikuji can either.
48|That is, if that's why you were asking how she became a ghost.
48|Of course that's why.
48|She had her own reasons to be lost. Lost in the real world.
48|As she ate her ice,
48|Animation Number 201
48|she talked about aberrations with a blank expression and asked me difficult questions.
48|Animation Number 201
48|That reason, or rather, objective, was already met over three months ago.
48|Really? Then why does she continue to be a ghost?
48|Dunno.
48|Then, devil boy, if you see her again, ask her that for me.
48|Ask her for you? What?
48|Isn't that obvious?
48|Whether or not she's happy as a ghost.
48|Animation Number 210
48|I couldn't find Hachikuji after all. It's not really a big deal
48|We have fun chats and interesting talks,
48|but I never understood her at all. I haven't been able to ask her the most important question.
48|Reference
48|I'm sure I can't ask the question Ononoki-chan entrusted me with either. I can't ask her a thing.
48|Because she won't tell me anything.
48|"What do you want to do?" "Where do your feelings lie?"
48|"Is there anything you would like me to do?"
48|There's so much I want her to tell me but can't bring myself to ask. I just want to grant all your wishes.
48|Then go grant them. Why are you pretending to be worried about that, you fool?
48|You know, nothing comes from worrying over things like that.
48|It's useless for you to ponder what that little girl wants to do or how she wants to be.
48|You shouldn't be asking that.
48|I shouldn't?
48|It's not like asking will do anything. Naturally, you'd wonder why you can't just grant that wish.
48|But you know better than anyone else that such a thing is impossible.
48|What you should be worried about lies elsewhere.
48|No, no, you're a high-school student. A student's main duty is to study.
48|I'm studying like I should.
48|You've been lurking in my shadow all summer break, so you know better than anyone.
48|Well, I do know that. How you were hustling in your studies quite a bit...
48|I was impressed that you were quite the student. I was literally cheering from the shadows.
48|But you know...
48|You haven't done any of your summer-break homework, have you?

48|Nobuemon, give me a time machine. I'll hop in and go back a day.
48|I understand adapting my name like it's in a Fujiko-sensei manga, but stop abbreviating my name as "Nobu."
48|Then, Shinobu, give me a time machine.
48|As if!
48|Well, if you merely want to time-travel, I can be convinced to help out.
48|Huh?
48|You want to go back to yesterday, right?
48|Let's do it!
48|Is time warping that easy?
48|I was on a groove and came as told, but this is totally a sci-fi world.
48|Are you an idiot? If there are aberrations out there, time travel exists as well.
48|And I was dubbed king of aberrations, one that kills aberrations,
48|there's nothing I can't do if I try.
48|Really now?
48|Animation Number 273
48|That sounds
48|Animation Number 273
48|fishy.
48|Animation Number 273
48|All right. These shrine gates should be good enough.
48|O red shadows that govern chaos!
48|I summon the sphere that toys with the flow of time!
48|Repeat forth the lights of weekends that come and go!
48|And fill the skies with overflowing thunder!
48|Walkers of the black! Swimmers of the gray!
48|With the mourning name filled with sin, thou shalt become the carrier!
48|Count me surprised!
48|Animation Number 288
48|A blast from the past!
48|Animation Number 282
48|We don't have
48|Animation Number 282

48|Is this linked to an alternate dimension or something?
48|Of course.
48|This went well for my first time!
48|Impressive, even after losing my powers and turning into a girl.
48|But wait. If you can create an alternate dimension, I don't think that counts as losing your powers.
48|It's not my powers. It's the location's.
48|I just converted the ghastly energy...
48|...that the unpleasant Hawaiian-shirt boy would call essences for aberrations gathered into heat energy.
48|What's that pseudoscience?
48|We should hurry though.
48|I don't think I can open this gate another time. It will close in a minute.
48|A minute? Hold on, I'm not mentally ready.
48|No need to be ready. Just jump in like normal.
48|Heh? It's that easy?
48|It's not something to brace yourself over. It's merely time travel.
48|Shinobu seems rather cheery,
48|Animation Number 307
48|rather unworried to me,
48|Animation Number 307
48|so the dangers are... probably... not great.
48|Animation Number 307
48|Okay, let's go!
48|Yeah! On our way!
48|Oh yes. You.
48|What?
48|No, that watch.
48|That watch.
48|Your watch that you wrap on your right wrist for vanity even though you're not left-handed. Lend me that.
48|No need for such detail. I get it.
48|Animation Number 316
48|But why?
48|Just give it to me.
48|What are you doing?
48|Don't get nervous from this.
48|We go to the bathroom and take baths together. We're always together.
48|For someone serious like me, holding hands makes me nervous no matter how long it's been.
48|Hush. Hurry up and jump. I have a shallow sense of time, so I have to match your cornering maneuvers.
48|Oh, I see. I get it. You can't do it by yourself.
48|All right. I'll take you there, Shinobu! To an unknown world!
48|Animation Number 332
48|When we passed through the shrine gate,
48|Animation Number 334
48|I didn't think about something as selfish as going back to the day before,
48|Animation Number 334
48|but instead reflected on Hachikuji.
48|Animation Number 334
48|Hey, you, wake up. Don't pass out from such a light shock as this.
48|Um...
48|What time is it?
48|Noon. Midday.
48|This is about halfway up the mountain?
48|Did we really time-travel?
48|Of course we succeeded.
48|I've never failed at anything since birth.
48|How much more blatantly can you brag?
48|But still, I think August 19th was a bright, sunny day like this.
48|No, isn't it just that I fell down the stairs and passed out for 12 hours?
48|Hey, Shinobu.
48|What?
48|Do we use those shrine gates to go back?
48|Yup. Something like that.
48|Why's your answer so vague?
48|Come to think of it, we didn't put much thought into the return trip.
48|And come to think of it, to open a gate to time warp,
48|she said it wasn't her powers but the location's. The energy drift known as North Shirahebi Shrine.
48|Now that we spent those powers, maybe you can't open that gate again, by chance?
48|Well...
48|Hey, wait, Shinobu.
48|We're not in a situation where we can't go back to our world from this one, right?
48|No, it's fine! It's all right! Nothing to worry about, my master.
48|Now think about it. This world is yesterday, right?
48|Looking at it from here, I opened the time tunnel using the essences of aberrations from tomorrow.
48|So those ghastly energies haven't been used at this point, so I can open that gate.
48|3
48|Huh? Doesn't that create a time paradox?
48|If we use that energy today, we can't come back to today from tomorrow.
48|Uhuh.
48|Animation Number 368
48|She said nothing.
48|Animation Number 368
48|She didn't know what to say.
48|Animation Number 368
48|Five minutes later
48|Animation Number 368
48|Well...
48|Oh, right! Now I remember!
48|Shinobu's opinion
48|Animation Number 369
48|It takes less energy to return to the future compared to going to the past.
48|Because we don't go against the flow. Same basic concept as salmon.
48|So we won't be using that much energy for the return trip.
48|So there will be enough energy left over for us to come here tomorrow.
48|Animation Number 373
48|Honestly, though, it did make me think.
48|Animation Number 373
48|I thought about the somewhat dangerous implications of time paradoxes.
48|Animation Number 373
48|What type of time warp was this anyway?
48|Type? What do you mean?
48|There are generally two kinds of time warp.
48|One where the traveler exists and one where they don't.
48|What? You mean like your standings within your high school classroom?
48|I'm always there!
48|Animation Number 378
48|I don't fade in and out of existence!
48|Animation Number 378
48|In other words, I'm asking if "yesterday's me" is home now,
48|or if the me standing here is already "yesterday's me."
48|Don't snooze!
48|Hmm. I don't understand it well.
48|But you can go confirm it for yourself. Go home and look at your room.
48|And whether or not you're there will show which type this is.
48|I guess so.
48|Wait, huh? Shinobu, how do you know what time it currently is?
48|I mean that watch is from the future, so it's not showing the correct time for this world, right?
48|I adjusted it earlier by guessing what time it was based on the sun.
48|It's troublesome to not know the time, which is why I had you take this watch off and borrowed it.
48|Let's go home for now.
48|Oh, then can I ride on your shoulders? Can I?
48|So cute!
48|She's like a doll!
48|Her hair is so fluffy!
48|Um, you, can you tell me something? Is today Monday, August 21st?
48|Huh? Not even close!
48|Then what's today's month and day?
48|What's with you, mister? You sound like you came from the future!
48|It's May 13th.
48|Is what they said.
48|Animation Number 398
48|I'll be damned.
48|Animation Number 398
48|13th of May
48|What year is it right now counting in Western years?
48|Well...
48|The junior-high girl replied...
48|...with the year eleven years prior to the present, or what is now the future.

48|Eh? What kind of ad lib is that? Do you want to quit on me all of a sudden?
48|That's not it. I just think maybe it's time to advance to the next stage.
48|Found it!
48|The next stage?
48|I, Tsukihi-chan, think it's time we became the Fire Systems!
48|It was an easy case this time.
48|Fire Systems? What do you know, it sounds so cool!
48|No foe will stand before our Fire System. Everything's going according to plan.
48|Well, let's go back!

49|I believe it is possible to make the trip back to the present.
49|You think so?
49|Let me explain everything from the ground up.
49|First, the Shrine of the Polar Snake.
49|Shrine of the Polar Snake
49|Scene no. 21
49|I used the spiritual energy there to get us to this era,
49|but the reason it had that energy in the first place
49|was because I came to this town.
49|Yeah, I remember that being the case.
49|Black
49|Unnumbered Scene
49|However, Shinobu only came to this town eleven years from now—
49|Shinobu was probably still wandering through distant countries in search of a place to die at this time
49|Scene no. 29
49|Huh? It's impossible, then.
49|We can't go back!
49|Don't jump to conclusions.
49|Sure, using an external source of energy might be impossible now,
49|but then we could just use my own energy, no?
49|Your own energy?
49|But you've lost pretty much all your vampire powers,
49|so that doesn't amount to much at all, does it?
49|Hear me out!
49|All I need is for you to let me drink some of your blood.
49|That way, I'll be able to open up a portal by myself.
49|And then we'll be able to go back eleven years into the future.
49|Oh, okay.
49|Well, since we've come all the way here,
49|what say we take a couple of days off before we go back to our era,
49|Shinobu?
49|If you're okay with that, then sure.
49|And there was
49|Scene no. 42

49|Huh?
49|Did you say something, my master?
49|I said we should save Hachikuji.
49|Eleven Years Earlier
49|I was wondering why it ended up being eleven years ago.
49|Looking for Tenants

49|Why it had to be May 13th—

49|Eleven years ago,
49|or well, eleven years and three months ago, to be precise.
49|I figured there must be a reason we traveled to this exact point in time.
49|Black
49|Unnumbered Scene
49|The reason—
49|Scene no. 84
49|Reason?
49|This is just a guess,
49|but I think tomorrow's the day Hachikuji will die.
49|The day that lost girl died?
49|Let me get this out of way: I'm not entirely sure.
49|Hachikuji only said she died a little more than a decade ago.
49|But one thing I do know for sure is that tomorrow is Mother's Day.
49|Black
49|Unnumbered Scene
49|Mother's Day.
49|That's when Hachikuji died
49|in a traffic accident.
49|So basically, if I'm right here,
49|Hachikuji will get run over and lose her life tomorrow.
49|On her way to seeing her separated mother, that is.
49|I do remember that being the case, yes.
49|So...
49|So let's save her.
49|Scene no. 94
49|I put some thought into this.
49|I racked my brain trying to figure out if there was something I could do in the past.
49|I'm finding it hard to put into words, but if I had to say,
49|I was wondering if I could do something to change destiny.
49|Didn't we reach the conclusion just now that you couldn't?
49|Well, hear me out here.
49|30
49|The first person that came to mind was Senjougahara.
49|Senjougahara Hitagi.
49|I tried to figure out if I could do anything to help my girlfriend.
49|Showing off, are we?
49|Nah, it's nothing of the sort.
49|I thought that maybe I could solve her problems from eleven years in the past.
49|Senjougahara Hitagi's problems
49|Scene no. 104
49|Her problems? That would be the Weight Crab?
49|That's not it, huh?
49|You're not talking about the crab, but her family?
49|That's right.
49|Her family issues.
49|One Mind
49|Stuff like her mother joining a shady cult, or her parents getting divorced.
49|Senjougahara's Problem
49|Scene no. 104

49|I wondered if I could eliminate the source of those problems before they happened.
49|You can't, obviously.
49|That would change a person's— no, the fates of many a person.
49|Figured as much.
49|In the same vein, I don't think I can do anything about Hanekawa's family either.
49|Well, if we're talking purely hypothetically here,
49|getting involved with the Hanekawas' issues might not be entirely out of the question.
49|But
49|Scene no. 111
49|But practically speaking, I think that's impossible.
49|That family's issues run too deep for a kid and a vampire to do anything about it.
49|Indeed.
49|Shinobu agreed on that. Without hesitation.
49|Scene no. 111
49|Similarly, you cannot do anything to help the monkey girl or the girl with the bangs.
49|As much as I hate to admit it, that brat with the Hawaiian shirt has it right.

49|What makes you think so?

49|Well, it's just that her getting run over was an accident.
49|Unlike family circumstances or the like,
49|this should be avoidable if you deal with that one incidental moment.
49|Nah. Sorry to be a wet blanket,
49|but I think that's pointless.
49|Let's say you prevented that lost girl from getting in harm's way tomorrow.
49|But you know, I think that'd only postpone the accident by a day or two.

49|were harsh—
49|Scene no. 121
49|you'll only be delaying the inevitable.
49|That's fine by me.
49|As long as she doesn't die tomorrow...
49|As long as she doesn't die on Mother's Day...
49|Hachikuji won't become an oddity, right?
49|If she manages to fulfill her goal of meeting her mother tomorrow,
49|she'll be satisfied and won't lose her way even if she dies.
49|Interesting.
49|To be honest, I think it's worth a shot.
49|Really?
49|Yeah.
49|Well, I'm not saying you'll succeed.
49|I actually think this will end in failure.
49|However, it might be worth a shot.
49|Because, like me, oddities are beings that exist outside destiny's framework.
49|As such, if you prevent the cause,
49|you might be able to stop one from being born.
49|I can do it.
49|I can save her.
49|That's why we're here.
49|That's why we came here.
49|We did it to save Hachikuji.
49|Yes.

49|30-5
49|That's what I'd heard.
49|Tsunaide
49|30-5
49|And I'm pretty sure she lived nearby the park where Hachikuji and I met.
49|That's where she was headed,
49|Namishiro Park
49|so she probably got into an accident somewhere in the vicinity.

49|Well, I can't exactly call it "good timing."
49|You could say it was the worst possible time.
49|Because I was holding a little blonde girl in my arms,
49|and because the silhouette in front of us was also of a little girl.
49|A girl around six years old.
49|She was walking with a book in hand,
49|wore glasses,

49|How could a high schooler like him exist?
49|The world really is shrouded in darkness!
49|L-Little miss...
49|You see, I knew your name because of your name tag.
49|Oh, right.
49|I'd like to ask you for directions.
49|Would you happen to know where a certain Tsunade lives?
49|Thank you.
49|You know everything, don't you?
49|I don't know everything.
49|I just know what I know.
49|Now we know where the Tsunade residence is.
49|Let us hurry.
49|Yeah.

49|Such a cute little girl, but apparently she's finding it hard to come visit.
49|She kept on talking and talking.

49|By the way, who are you? How do you know Tsunade?

49|Since we were going to be staking the place out, I had Shinobu take on the form of a middle schooler.
49|The idea was that she'd look really pretty in that form
49|and give off a sense of nobility that'd make it hard for people to approach her.
49|She was imitating past Hanekawa.
49|Scene no. 256
49|Furthermore, a school uniform acts as a form of identity proof,
49|thus warding off any suspicion.
49|I will meet her.

49|Hey, you two.
49|Huh?
49|Y-Yes?
49|Have you seen my daughter?
49|She's in fifth grade, has pigtails,
49|and was probably carrying a large backpack.
49|No, we haven't.
49|What about her?
49|W-Well, my daughter...
49|It seems she ran away from home.
49|I thought she was taking forever to wake up, so I snuck into her room
49|Hachikuji Mayoi's Room
49|Scene no. 272
49|only to find that she'd left behind a note.
49|To Dad
49|Judging from the contents, I think she left home at around 5 AM.
49|She left at five in the morning.
49|Scene no. 275
49|Is she a fisherman or something?

49|Her father said she left home at 5 AM, so why has she only gotten as far as this park?
49|This is just a guess, but she's probably lost.
49|She said this was the first time in her life she made a trip this far by herself.
49|What are you planning to do?
49|"What," you ask?
49|I'm planning to guide her to Tsunade's house.
49|What? You're going to make contact with her?
49|I don't have a choice.
49|If she kept walking about all over the place,

49|I know.
49|Um, are you all right?
49|What about you? Are you okay?
49|I'm sorry.
49|I was in a panic because some weirdo started chasing me around like a freak.
49|I didn't have the time to look at the signal.
49|I see.
49|A freak, huh?
49|That is unacceptable.
49|Well, the world is full of weirdos, so you'd better be careful out there.
49|You're very lucky that someone like me, the very picture of a decent man,
49|suddenly showed up to save the day as he was passing by.
49|I did my best to play dumb. I could feel a painfully biting gaze from my shadow, but did my best to ignore it.
49|Scene no. 343
49|You're right.
49|Also, I'm kinda lost right now.
49|Let me see that note for a second, then.
49|Black
49|Unnumbered Scene
49|That was the exact same thing I said back when I met Hachikuji for the first time.
49|Scene no. 346
49|Thank you so much!
49|No problem. Bye.
49|Bye
49|Scene no. 350
49|Yes?
49|Now then.
49|We did what he had to, so Shinobu,
49|shall we go back to the present?
49|Are you done?
49|What's the time?
49|4 PM.
49|So it'll be twilight soon, huh?
49|Then let's wait for that, head back to the Shrine of the Polar Snake,
49|get you as close to your vampire form as possible,
49|open up a time tunnel and go back to the present.
49|The state the shrine was in shook me to my very core.
49|We'd only gone back eleven years, so obviously the place wasn't going to look brand new.
49|Still, I expected it to at least be in a better state now than in the present.
49|But right from the gate to the main shrine...
49|everything in this place
49|was in ruins.
49|Wh-What does this mean?
49|Scene no. 375
49|Give me a break!
49|You'd better not tell me we mistakenly traveled to the future instead of the past!
49|You could write a pretty interesting mystery novel based on that reveal!
49|No way.
49|You met the younger versions of the Ex-Class Rep and Hachikuji, did you not?
49|You also met yourself.
49|Hachikuji and Little Koyomi aside,
49|there's no way you would mistake Little Miss Ex-Class Rep.
49|That's right.
49|Well, I guess I don't have to worry about all this.
49|We'll be leaving now anyway.
49|Go ahead, Shinobu.
49|Drink a little more of my blood and power up as much as you can.
49|No, my master. We're in luck.
49|There's no need for that, it seems.
49|This place is full of spiritual energy even in this era.
49|This place clearly became a den for oddities when I came here eleven years from now.
49|But it seems this place was prone to gather spiritual energy even before that.
49|It could also mean that someone like me came here, though.
49|Either way, using all the energy here shouldn't cause any problems.
49|Besides, my getting as close to my vampire form as possible
49|carries a certain amount of risk.
49|Risk? I don't seem to recall any.
49|There's the risk of me betraying you.
49|I've lost all of my powers, which is why I'm able to be nice and friendly with you.
49|But the more I regain my powers,
49|the closer I'll get to my true nature as an oddity.
49|Black
49|Unnumbered Scene
49|Anyway, guess I'll use the gate again to open up a portal.
49|The black wall appears
49|Scene no. 389
49|What happened to the chant?
49|Oops, I forgot.
49|Hey!
49|No, it's not like I forgot the chant itself.
49|I merely forgot to chant it.
49|What's the difference?
49|Come, my master.
49|Yeah.
49|Let me confirm this just in case.
49|When we jump in, we'll end up on the staircase on the other side again, right?
49|Yeah. The staircase eleven years in the future.
49|I see.
49|I'd better brace myself, then.
49|I'll have to jump in as slowly as possible.
49|Wait, maybe it'd be better if I jumped in backwards.
49|No, I wouldn't recommend that.
49|It is crucial that you clearly picture the destination in your mind.
49|If we jump in backwards, we might end up drifting in the schism of space and time forever.
49|Forget not recommending it, you should be stopping me with everything you've got!
49|Fine.
49|I'll look straight ahead as I jump in.
49|I managed to survive one of Kagenui's brutal ass-kickings.
49|Surely falling down the stairs isn't going to kill me.
49|In the end, Shinobu and I jumped into the black wall just like we did when we came here
49|and returned to the nostalgic present day.
49|We had no idea what was lying in wait for us.
49|We didn't even try to imagine how much I changed the future by saving Hachikuji.
49|Actually, well, let me get straight to the point.
49|When Shinobu and I returned from our time travels to the present day,
49|we found the world in ruins.
49|Let's feel each other's heartbeat
49|and tell each other of our feelings without lies
49|A normal Friday
49|is part of a series of days full of doubts and regrets
49|I try to think of a plan
49|to tell you of my love, but suddenly the day is over
49|I get so insecure when your eyes drift away
49|I don't want to wind up being super jealous
49|You know, I wish it was just us two
49|Don't laugh at my innocent words of love
49|Like I'd ever give up on you again
49|I desperately look for an answer
49|It's so ridiculous
49|Let's look into each other's eyes
49|discard our fear
49|and try explaining our feelings
49|Let's take a deep breath and try again

50|O-O-Of course.
50|I'm sure I can properly get us back to the present.
50|Is that so?
50|Let me explain in order. First, about North Shirahebi Shrine.
50|North Shirahebi Shrine
50|Animation Number 21
50|By coming back to this time, I used the spiritual energies from that location,
50|but since the energy that drifted there was a result of me coming to this town...
50|Oh, that's how the story went?
50|However, Shinobu arriving here is a story 11 years from now.
50|Shinobu was probably still wandering through distant countries in search of a place to die at this time
50|Animation Number 29
50|But then it's hopeless. We can't go home!
50|Don't jump to conclusions. True, we can't gain spiritual energies from there.
50|That just means we have to use my internal energy.
50|Internal energy?
50|But you've lost most of your vampire powers, so the energy you have is miniscule, right?
50|So all you have to do is let me drink a bit of your blood. Then I can open a gate by myself.
50|And using that, we can go back to 11 years in the future.
50|Then while we're here, you want to play around for a couple days before we go back, Shinobu?
50|If you're fine with that, I'm good too.
50|And there was
50|Animation Number 42

50|Let's save Hachikuji.
50|Huh? What? Did you say something?
50|I said let's go save Hachikuji.
50|Well, I've been thinking... About why it had to be 11 years ago.
50|Eleven Years Earlier
50|Looking for Tenants
50|May 13th
50|New Residents Support Center
50|And why it was May 13th, the second Saturday of May.
50|Second Saturday
50|I thought there had to be a reason why I'd pick this date 11 years ago...
50|...or more precisely, 11 years and three months ago.
50|The reason——
50|Animation Number 84
50|Your reason?
50|30
50|It's just a hunch, but tomorrow's the day Hachikuji died.
50|The day that lost girl died?
50|I'll say first that I'm not positive. She only said a bit more than 10 years ago,
50|but the one thing I'm sure of is that tomorrow is Mother's Day.
50|Mother's Day. Hachikuji Mayoi died on Mother's Day in a traffic accident.
50|In other words, if what I'm thinking is correct, tomorrow, Hachikuji will be hit by a car and die.
50|On her way to visit her mother, who lives far away.
50|I believe that's how the story went. So...
50|So we should save her.
50|I gave it lots of thought. Since we're here in the past world, isn't there anything we can do?
50|I can't put it into words well, but can we do anything about something that was destined?
50|Wasn't your conclusion just now that we couldn't do stuff like that?
50|Well, listen to my thoughts in order. I first thought about Senjougahara.
50|30
50|Was there something I could do for my girlfriend, Senjougahara Hitagi?
50|Are you going to gush over her, or...?
50|No, not really.
50|I was wondering if I could solve the problems she was carrying from the viewpoint of 11 years ago.
50|Senjougahara Hitagi's issues
50|Animation Number 104
50|Hm? The problems that girl was carrying were about the Weight Crab...
50|No, that's not right. It was her family, not the crab...
50|Right. Family issues.
50|Her mother getting obsessed with an evil cult, and the mutual divorce.
50|One Mind
50|Senjougahara's Problem
50|Animation Number 104
50|Divorce Notice
50|I was wondering if I could cut such problems at the root before they sprouted.
50|That's impossible, because you'd end up changing the destiny of one person, no, many people.
50|You're probably right.
50|And I can't think I can do anything about Hanekawa's family issues either.
50|No, if it's purely about possibility, I might have some way to get into the Hanekawa family affairs.
50|But
50|Animation Number 111
50|But I think it's totally impossible.
50|The infectious focus of their family is way above the level of one high-school student or vampire.
50|Right.
50|Shinobu agreed on that. Without hesitation.
50|Animation Number 111
50|Similarly, it's impossible for you to do anything about that monkey girl or the bangs girl.
50|Exactly as that hated Hawaiian-shirt guy said.
50|People save themselves on their own. Nobody can ever save anyone else.
50|Yeah, but I think I can save Hachikuji.
50|For Pedestrans
50|And Bicycles Only
50|Why do you think that? You seem oddly sure, but there's no guarantee.
50|For the Disabled
50|Buzzer
50|Well, I mean, the traffic accident was something that happened by chance, right?
50|Timed Traffic Light
50|It's not like family affairs. It can be averted if you just avert that one chance moment.
50|Well, I hate to spoil the party, but I think it will be meaningless.
50|Let's say you protect that lost girl from the harm she is about to face tomorrow.
50|But I think in that case, it's merely postponing the accident to the next day or the day after.
50|Perhaps it's not even a traffic accident at all.

50|Shinobu's words
50|Animation Number 121
50|What you're trying to do is merely delaying...
50|were harsh—
50|Animation Number 121
50|...merely putting it off.
50|That's fine.
50|As long as her death's not tomorrow, not on Mother's Day, Hachikuji won't become an aberration.
50|If she can see her mother tomorrow as planned...
50|No matter what, she'll be fulfilled. And even when she dies, there's no reason to be lost.
50|Interesting. Honestly, I think there's some merit in trying it out.
50|You think?
50|Yes. Though it's not a guarantee of success.
50|Rather, I think it will just plain fail.
50|But I think there might be some value in trying.
50|Like how I am, aberrations exist outside of the frames set by destiny.
50|Therefore, by averting the one catalyst, you could at least prevent her from turning into an aberration.
50|I can save her. I can save that girl.
50|The reason we're here. Why we came here.
50|It was to save Hachikuji.
50|Yes.
50|Animation Number 136
50|That was her destiny.
50|Animation Number 136
50|Animation Number 138
50|I think I heard Tsunade was Hachikuji's mother's maiden name.
50|Animation Number 143
50|Tsunaide
50|30-5
50|Tsunaide
50|30-5
50|And that Tsunade-san should be living near the park where I met Hachikuji.
50|That has to be the destination and where she got in the accident.
50|Namishiro Park
50|Black Scene
50|I just have to prevent the traffic accident. I say that like it's easy...
50|...but when I think realistically, things don't go as well as expected.
50|Tsunazoku
50|When I think about it, Hachikuji used to live in this town until her parents' divorce.
50|Tsunaoka
50|2-5
50|Tetsuna
50|I should research the neighborhood people.
50|As I thought, "Like someone walking on the road," with good timing, we noticed a person in front of us.
50|Naoetsu
50|Chinese Soba Noodles
50|No, it's hard to say good timing.
50|You could say the worst timing instead.
50|I mean, I was cradling a young blonde girl. And the person approaching was also a young girl.
50|She was about six. Reading while walking.
50|Wearing glasses. One big braid in the back. Looking diligent.
50|She was an amazingly super-cute young girl.
50|A bewitching, serious-looking girl
50|Animation Number 163
50|Wait, that's Hanekawa Tsubasa-chan!
50|W-Who are you? How do you know my name?
50|No, you don't need to answer me. I can tell by looking. You're a pervert, right?!
50|Suddenly the young Hanekawa hated me. It made me go down on my knees and bow.
50|Animation Number 172
50|Woo-hoo! Hanekawa in street clothes! This is the best!
50|This is the first time he sees Hanekawa Tsubasa out of her school uniform.
50|Animation Number 173
50|And smooth, flat Hanekawa rules!
50|Animation Number 178
50|Amazing! She's all flat!
50|Animation Number 178
50|The young Hanekawa is trying to escape. She is afraid!
50|Animation Number 178
50|Afraid of me!
50|Animation Number 179
50|You should calm down.
50|If you get arrested now, it's impossible to be freed before tomorrow.
50|Restraint.
50|Animation Number 183
50|Restraint
50|Restraint.
50|Animation Number 185
50|Restraint Restraint
50|Restraint.
50|Animation Number 187
50|Restraint Restraint Restraint
50|Restraint.
50|Restraint!
50|Animation Number 189
50|Restraint Restraint Restraint Restraint
50|What's with this guy? Scary. He's crying blood and standing straight up.
50|To think there'd be a high-school student like this... The world is pitch-black after all.
50|Y-Young lady...
50|I knew your name because you had a name tag.
50|Right, I wanted to ask for directions.
50|Do you know where Tsunade-san lives?
50|Thanks. You sure know everything, don't you?
50|It's not that I know everything. I just know what I know.
50|Now we know where the Tsunade residence is. Let's hurry on over.
50|Right.
50|National Police Agency Namishiro Park Southern Office
50|She fooled us...
50|Even when she was this young, Hanekawa was shrewd.
50|Animation Number 212
50|Oh, you mean Tsunade's house? Let's see...
50|Tsunade-san really has it rough.
50|She totally aged after the divorce.
50|I can't blame her. She really cherished the one girl she had.
50|Wanted
50|Um, what was her name? Oh right, Mayoi-chan.
50|The police woman was rather talkative.
50|Animation Number 216
50|She was really cute but apparently can't visit that often.
50|She kept on talking and talking.
50|Animation Number 217
50|It must have taken an hour.
50|Animation Number 217
50|What's your relation to Tsunade-san?
50|I'm a friend. Mayoi-chan's friend.
50|Let's check it out.
50|Right.
50|Do you realize what it means to save that lost girl here?
50|Hachikuji Mayoi won't become an aberration.
50|If the lost cow isn't lost, it doesn't get lost on its way.
50|It means you won't be able to meet that girl 11 years in the future, no?
50|Of course. I had known that all along.
50|Hachikuji's family, eleven years earlier
50|Animation Number 236
50|I had hoped to get visual confirmation of Hachikuji this evening.
50|I guess the lost girl and her father are both already asleep.
50|Then let's go look for somewhere to sleep like we planned.
50|14th of May
50|Hachikuji
50|In doing the stakeout, I had Shinobu become junior-high age.
50|At this age, she becomes beautiful, emanating an unapproachable nobility.
50|She was imitating past Hanekawa.
50|Animation Number 256
50|I thought it'd be harder to get flagged down.
50|On top of that, a uniform proves who you are, so people won't be suspicious.
50|I will meet her.
50|Animation Number 257
50|I will meet Mayoi while she was alive.
50|Animation Number 257
50|She's not coming out. How long will she make us wait?
50|You're really not the stakeout type, huh?
50|It's only been a few hours.
50|Excuse me, you guys.
50|O-Oh, yes?
50|You haven't seen my daughter, have you? She's in fifth grade right now...
50|She ties her hair in two places, and I think she's carrying a large backpack.
50|Oh, no, I didn't see her. Did something happen to that girl?
50|S-She's my daughter, but it seems she ran away from home.
50|I went to her room, thinking she was sleeping in quite a bit.
50|Hachikuji Mayoi's Room
50|Animation Number 272
50|There was a note, and based on what was written, it seems she left around 5 AM.
50|To Dad
50|She left at five in the morning.
50|Animation Number 275
50|Is she a fisherman or something?
50|Animation Number 275
50|Hachikuji!
50|I blurted out her name.
50|Animation Number 278
50|How far does she have to go?
50|Animation Number 279
50|I ran as fast as I could carrying Shinobu.
50|Animation Number 281
50|Damn, we should've hidden behind that phone pole, suspicious or not!
50|Perhaps this is how destiny forces itself to happen. So that girl is destined to end up...
50|...dying by getting hit by a car today.
50|What destiny?
50|I'm not going to accept that kind of destiny! Damn it!
50|Namishiro Park
50|Animation Number 289
50|A girl, alone.
50|Animation Number 290
50|Hey, you!
50|My emergency braking failed.
50|Animation Number 295
50|Shinobu, this way.
50|Having turned into a vampire, my wounds would soon heal anyway.
50|Animation Number 300
50|Hachikuji Mayoi, in the flesh
50|Animation Number 300
50|Why is that girl, who left her home at 5 AM, still lingering around in this park?
50|Maybe...
50|She's really lost. She did say it was the first time she went out by herself.
50|What's your plan?
50|What am I going to do? I'm going to go guide her all the way to Tsunade-san's house.
50|What, you'll make contact?
50|No choice. If she keeps wandering around, the chances of her getting into an accident skyrockets.
50|I should be able to give her decent directions. Let her witness my grown-up shape.
50|Animation Number 312
50|Kid runs away
50|Animation Number 318
50|Oh! Shoot!
50|I chased Hachikuji
50|Animation Number 319
50|Damn! The power that forces history? Something always gets in the way of saving her!
50|That can't be called anything but reaping what you sow.
50|I had to chase her to be on the safe side
50|Animation Number 320
50|and to persuade her
50|Animation Number 321
50|that I'm totally not suspicious
50|Animation Number 321
50|and start from there.
50|Animation Number 321
50|This will be complicated.
50|Animation Number 321
50|Are you all right?
50|Yeah, I'm fine.
50|Vampires only have high regeneration skills. It doesn't mean they're resistant to pain, you know.
50|I understand that.
50|Um, are you all right?
50|Y-You too, are you all right?
50|Sorry, a weird man assaulted me in a perverted manner...
50|...so I was panicking. I didn't have time to look at the signal...
50|I see. A pervert. That's unforgivable.
50|Well, there's all sorts of weird people out there, so you should be careful.
50|Well, it's a good thing that a guy like me...
50|...a picture of the word respectable, appeared.
50|Yes, you're right.
50|I did my best to play dumb.
50|Animation Number 343
50|And I'm a bit lost right now, too.
50|That note, let me see it for a second.
50|That was the exact same line I said to her the first time we met.
50|Thank you so much!
50|Sure. Bye.
50|Bye
50|Animation Number 350
50|Yes?
50|Well, we've done what we wanted to do. Shinobu, let's go back to the present.
50|You're ready already?
50|What time is it now?
50|Four PM.
50|In other words, almost twilight. Let's wait for that, go back to North Shirahebi Shrine
50|turn you back into a vampire as much as possible, and make a time tunnel to go back to the present.
50|What surprised me was the actual state of North Shirahebi Shrine.
50|It's 11 years ago, so I didn't think it'd be just built.
50|At the least, I thought it'd have more of the original building's shape than it did now.
50|But from the shrine gates to the main building... Anything and everything was in tatters.
50|What's going on?
50|Come on, give me a break.
50|Animation Number 375
50|Don't tell me the punch line is we went to the future instead of the past.
50|You could write a pretty good mystery novel using that trick.
50|That can't be. You met people you knew. Loli ex-Class Prez and the young Hachikuji.
50|Your young self too.
50|Hachikuji and Shota Koyomi aside, it'd be impossible for you to mistake Loli ex-Class Prez for someone else.
50|That's true.
50|Well, I guess we don't have to give it much thought. We're going home anyway.
50|All right, Shinobu, drink a bit more of my blood and power up to your limits.
50|No, you're pretty lucky here. It seems there's no need to do so.
50|This place, even in this period, is filled with spiritual energies.
50|I'm sure it became a den of aberrations due to my arrival 11 years later.
50|But even before, this seems to be a place where energies easily drift.
50|It could also be that someone of my kind came here.
50|Using it all shouldn't be a problem.
50|After all, there's a fixed rate of risk with taking my act of vampirism to the limit.
50|Was there a risk?
50|The risk of me betraying you.
50|Because I've lost my powers, I'm being amiable with you now.
50|But as more of my powers are restored, I will regain my true nature as an aberration.
50|Now, to make the gate, I guess I'll use the shrine gate.
50|The black wall appears
50|Animation Number 389
50|Hey, what about the spell?
50|I forgot.
50|Come on.
50|No.
50|It's not that I forgot the spell's words. I just forgot to chant it.
50|Isn't that the same thing?
50|You.
50|Yeah.
50|I'm going to double-check. When we jump in, there'll be a staircase again, right?
50|The staircase 11 years from now.
50|I see. Then I have to prepare to break the fall.
50|I have to kill most of the momentum... No, maybe it's better to jump in backwards.
50|No, I wouldn't recommend that. It's important to get a good image of the era you're heading to.
50|If you jumped in backwards, we might end up wandering time and space forever.
50|Don't just not recommend it. Do everything you can to stop me!
50|Having to forever roam some otherworld
50|for saving a lost little girl would be pretty harsh.
50|The eternal life of a vampire makes this punishment even harsher.
50|Animation Number 395
50|All right. I'll face forward when I jump in.
50|Since this body can stay alive even after Kagenui-san beats me up...
50|...I'm sure merely falling down the stairs won't kill me.
50|In the end, Shinobu and I jumped into the black wall just like when we arrived in the past.
50|We returned to the nostalgia of the present.
50|Not knowing what would be in store for us.
50|Not imagining just how much the future world had changed by me saving Hachikuji.
50|Or rather, well, speaking from the conclusion first...
50|When Shinobu and I ended our time trip and returned to the world 11 years later...
50|...the entire world had been annihilated.

50|There's only one.
50|Forget about that!
50|Did you just say famous?
50|I wonder how marshmallows are actually made.
50|Should have called the song "Marshmallow Feature".
50|Hey, you got any material on this?
50|Seriously though, how do you make those sweets?
50|Doesn't it bother you that, despite being sweets, they look like fruits?
50|Let's see...

51|Everyone else is gone!
51|Why don't we check out some other houses, just in case?
51|We need to see if it's just the Araragi residence, or the entire town that's in this state.
51|I think it's pretty evident either way.
51|But we have to confirm it with our own eyes.
51|That is our responsibility.

51|After that, we decided to inspect not only the houses in the vicinity,

51|but also places all over town.

51|We spent about five hours doing so.

51|no doubt about it,
51|plausible conclusion.
51|it seems.
51|This is useless! The whole world?
51|This situation's so large in scale that it doesn't feel real at all.
51|I'm so shocked that I can't even panic.
51|Karen and Tsukihi are missing.
51|Senjougahara, Hanekawa, Kanbaru, and Sengoku are all nowhere to be found.
51|And yet I can't feel any sorrow.
51|I'm honestly appalled at myself.
51|But I can't. I just can't.
51|This is too much.
51|But seriously, what is this all about?
51|Are you telling me that Hachikuji, having lived for longer than she did originally,
51|went and did something outrageous that caused the destruction of the world?
51|No. I find it hard to believe that she was capable of something like that.
51|Scene no. 106
51|This basically means something happened late on the night of June 14th.
51|It happened after the evening paper was distributed, and before the morning newspaper was finished.
51|It's like Dee-Dee pushed the big red button.
51|Scene no. 109
51|Some sort of incident took place,
51|This is pretty SF.
51|Scene no. 109
51|and the world was destroyed—not step by step, but it collapsed in one go like a house of cards.
51|I wonder if it's safe to make that assumption.
51|I think we should consider this to be the work of an oddity.
51|Only oddities are free from the influence of history and fate, right?
51|That's exactly why you're capable of time travel,
51|and why I could prevent Hachikuji from becoming one.
51|Makes sense.
51|That sounds quite plausible.
51|My logic probably holds water.
51|Scene no. 116
51|Shinobu is thinking about something.
51|Scene no. 117
51|What's wrong, Shinobu?
51|Well, I was on the brink of coming up with something,
51|but it's just not hitting me at the moment.
51|My memory is well and truly useless, I see.
51|Huh? Do you have an idea or something?
51|Just that.
51|Scene no. 122
51|Do you know why the world ended up like this?
51|She seemed like she was really troubled.
51|Scene no. 122
51|And, if it was indeed an oddity's doing,
51|do you know which one it was?
51|Hmm. I'm not sure.
51|Anyway, we've made some progress.
51|We now know when the world was destroyed.
51|Yeah.
51|The question now is what exactly happened on that day—on that night.
51|We can't do anything without that knowledge.
51|Do anything?
51|Do you intend to do something about this state of affairs?
51|Well...
51|What if everyone was spirited away or something?
51|They'd all be able to come back if we solved the oddity problem, right?
51|I don't really know, to be honest.
51|Scene no. 128
51|We may not be able to fill this two-month void,
51|but I'm sure we can restore the world to its original state.
51|Not like there's any certainty, though.
51|Scene no. 130
51|So I want to know why the world was destroyed.
51|I see.
51|Shall we go find out, then?

51|February, 1919
51|Donor
51|Well...
51|There is absolutely no energy left.
51|Oh...
51|I suppose that's the reason why.
51|Huh? This...
51|Scene no. 151
51|Black
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|This is a different talisman.
51|What does this mean?
51|Rather than it being of a different type, it's more like it has a different effect.
51|The Hawaiian shirt brat gave you different talismans before and after history changed.
51|Scene no. 155
51|Different Effect
51|Scene no. 156
51|It appears that the fate of the world was not the only thing affected.
51|Loads of minor historical details like this have also undergone a change.
51|It's not minor to us, though.
51|The talisman you put up scattered spiritual energy and prevented it from settling,
51|Purity in Spirit
51|whereas this one absorbs spiritual energy.
51|The spiritual energy necessary for a time warp
51|Scene no. 163
51|A-Absorb?
51|has been absorbed
51|and we were never able to go back in time.
51|Scene no. 163
51|It has a far more extreme effect than the one you were entrusted with.
51|Though, well, they both prevent a major monster war, so they're similar in that aspect.
51|I guess.
51|Like a burst of anger
51|Scene no. 165
51|I know that I'm pretending to be innocent and that I'm being unreasonable by saying this,
51|but I guess I might as well be selfish and say it since nobody's listening.
51|What the hell, Oshino? What have you done?!
51|That is awfully selfish.
51|In the Hawaiian shirt brat's eyes, there's no difference between the two talismans.
51|But yeah, I don't think he'd leave such an important decision down to luck.
51|I'm sure there was a reason that made this a necessary call in this timeline.
51|There's no point in trying to figure out what it was anymore, though, is there?
51|Indeed.
51|Guess the only thing we can do now is throw some money in and hope we get some divine help.
51|Oh, hang on.
51|What if we took this talisman off and waited patiently?
51|The so-called spiritual energy would once again gather in this place, wouldn't it?
51|My master!
51|Scene no. 181
51|This talisman isn't one that you—no.
51|It's not one that oddities such as myself can touch.
51|I see.
51|It's hopeless, then.
51|Hopeless it is.
51|Scene no. 196
51|Wh-What the hell are these?
51|Rotten Corpses
51|Scene no. 205
51|Zombies?
51|Caught between life and death for all eternity
51|Scene no. 207
51|Don't move, my master.
51|Looks like they won't get any closer if we stay here.
51|Huh? Okay.
51|Why is that?
51|Why aren't they getting any closer?
51|It must be due to this talisman.
51|This is as close as they can get.
51|They know that it's dangerous to get any closer.
51|They know?
51|Anyway, we should get out of here while this miracle talisman is still working.
51|Huh? Get out of here?
51|Didn't you say we were safe here?
51|As you can see, they're growing in numbers.
51|Frankly, I can't get a read on this situation.
51|That, and...
51|Since they're oddities, I don't think they're enemies of mine. Or yours, for that matter.
51|But they might be zombies created from the corpses of the residents of this town.
51|We can't thoughtlessly kick them about, can we?
51|You're right.
51|So we're running away for now, my master.
51|We somehow managed to escape.
51|Yeah.
51|But what on earth were they?
51|I haven't a clue.
51|That said, rather than zombies, they were more like...
51|Oh my god.
51|Yeah, I've made an inexcusable mistake that I simply can't atone for.
51|It's all because I traveled back in time and tried to change history.
51|I've turned the entire human race into zombies!
51|No.
51|You don't need to feel responsible for this, my master.
51|I'm the one at fault.
51|This is all my doing.
51|What do you mean?
51|I appreciate the thought, but Shinobu,
51|I was the one who...
51|No, I'm not taking the blame for you.
51|It's the solemn truth.
51|The harsh reality.
51|Shinobu!
51|Just hear me out.
51|Firstly, my master, those are not zombies.
51|They're the remains of what used to be vampires!
51|Vamp... ires?
51|Scene no. 291
51|Vamp... ires?
51|I suppose I should say they're the same as you.
51|Because, just like you, they're all humans that I turned into vampires.
51|Scene no. 300
51|You?!
51|Yes.
51|In other words, the one who destroyed the world in this timeline...
51|was me.
51|Black
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|Scene no. 196
51|We maintained an altitude of 300 meters above sea level and waited for the sun to rise.
51|And then came dawn.
51|When the sun rose from the east,
51|the swarm of zombies disappeared from the surface.
51|22nd of August
51|Well?
51|What did you mean when you said it was your fault?
51|Tell me.
51|My fault.
51|To be more precise, it's this timeline's me that is at fault.
51|And by that, you mean the Oshino Shinobu in this version of history—the one that we created, right?
51|Main Street
51|93
51|Yes.
51|In this world, I—the other me—turned all of mankind into vampires two months ago.
51|That's what I mean.
51|June 14th.
51|I finally managed to remember what day that was earlier.
51|What day it was?
51|I'm sure you remember that day well too. It should've left an impression on you.
51|Not striking you yet?
51|Well, it's the day the world got destroyed.
51|Of course it'd leave an impression.
51|The night of June 14th, or perhaps June 15th—
51|That's not it!
51|I mean the original one!
51|The night of June 14th in the original timeline.
51|June 14th, eh?
51|The 14th... The 14th...
51|Er, that's Wednesday, so June 15th would be a Thursday.
51|Not striking you, I see.
51|Black
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|Maybe you'd understand if I said June 15th was the day before the culture festival.
51|Oh...
51|Looks like you've hit upon it.
51|Y-Yeah.
51|You're a horrible man.
51|It was the day you and your lover went on your first date.
51|The day Miss Ex-Class Rep, who you keep calling your savior, was involved in a major incident.
51|The day I ran away from home,
51|and the day the Hawaiian shirt brat up and left.
51|Black
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|And yet you forgot all about it.
51|Scene no. 418
51|But, you know, I still don't know what this means.
51|Yeah, a lot happened that day,
51|but at no point was the entire world in danger.
51|If I had to pick one thing, Black Hanekawa running amok was indeed an oddity phenomenon.
51|Well, Black Hanekawa isn't entirely unrelated,
51|but me running away is what's important.
51|When you ran away?
51|But that was resolved without a hitch—
51|Black
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|No, that's wrong.
51|When I say it was resolved without a hitch, it only applies to the timeline we know and experienced.
51|Does that mean there was some kind of hitch, or maybe that it wasn't resolved in this timeline?
51|Black
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|In the end, I never told you anything about that event,
51|and you made sure not to ask me anything either.
51|I appreciate that consideration, so I won't go into explicit detail here.
51|Even so,
51|allow me to disclose something that I can no longer conceal.
51|Okay. Don't beat around the bush.
51|If you hadn't found me that day,
51|I was going to destroy the world.
51|I had no idea it was that big a deal!
51|Wh-Why?
51|Desperation. Or well, it was more like I was going to vent, if I had to pick one.
51|So, in this world—
51|Uh, this is confusing.
51|So Araragi Koyomi never managed to find you on June 14th in this timeline?
51|That's what it boils down to, I guess.
51|Scene no. 449
51|Think about it.
51|The first person who realized that I'd run away was that lost girl, no?
51|No, that's not all there is to it.
51|If Hachikuji—
51|Hachikuji the oddity disappeared—
51|then let alone June 14th,
51|5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
51|I wouldn't have met her on that Mother's Day.
51|May
51|That means this world's Araragi Koyomi never met Hachikuji Mayoi.
51|Namishiro Residential Complex
51|I see.
51|In that case, I was probably killed by Black Hanekawa back then.
51|Red
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|Shinobu, you don't have to answer this question if you don't want to.
51|Just casually hear me out.
51|Frankly speaking, it's something I've never thought about, or wanted to think about.
51|How about it?
51|You and I have been bound to each other ever since Spring Break.
51|Under these circumstances, if either one of us died an unforeseen death,
51|what would happen to the other one?
51|Since we're bound to each other, would the other one die too?
51|Black
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|Or would...
51|Black
51|Unnumbered Scene
51|It's the latter.
51|I'm absolutely sure that dumb feline didn't know,
51|but well, the Hawaiian shirt brat probably did.
51|He told you, didn't he?
51|That you could turn back into a human at any time if you abandoned me.
51|Scene no. 478
51|Then, looking at it the other way around, if I died,
51|would you get your powers back and turn back into the legendary strongest vampire?
51|A vampire of
51|Scene no. 481
51|You'd turn back into the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, and cold-blooded vampire, wouldn't you?
51|blood and iron,
51|Scene no. 481
51|zeal,
51|Scene no. 481
51|and cold calculation.
51|Scene no. 481
51|And then I'd destroy the world with everything I had.
51|To be more specific, I'd turn the people of this town,
51|everyone in Japan,
51|and people all over the world into vampires.
51|Since the Industrial Revolution, the world population has

51|Population in Bn
51|You turned all the people in the world into vampires?
51|Well, I probably only sucked the blood of the first few victims.
51|Those few would become just like me: vampires who'd try to destroy the world,
51|and go on to suck the blood of the people around them.
51|The vampires born that way would also be my servants.
51|They would also be vampires who'd try to destroy the world.
51|That's probably how they multiplied like rats, increased in population like a geometric progression,
51|and within the blink of an eye, destroyed the world,
51|or well, destroyed the entire human race.
51|But if we go by that, I'm dead, but you're not.
51|Where is this timeline's you and what are you doing?
51|After destroying the world, what did you...
51|Er, you're here, but what about her?
51|It is quite likely that the me of this timeline is already dead.
51|Dead?
51|It goes without saying.
51|There is only one being that could kill me in my heyday:
51|yours truly.
51|I must've committed suicide.
51|And because I died,
51|my servant vampires all turned into zombies.
51|One could turn back into a human by killing you with their own hands,
51|but if you were already dead, that method would be useless, huh?
51|The vampire blood would run amok, and there'd be no way to stop it.
51|I'm sorry.
51|Huh?
51|This was never my intention.
51|I only wanted you to find me.
51|And yet, I destroyed your precious world for such a childish reason.
51|Knock it off.
51|Don't apologize.
51|Don't blame yourself.
51|Sure, the you of this timeline may have destroyed the world,
51|but that's not something you yourself did.
51|W-Well, yeah, but I don't see the difference.
51|Either way, Shinobu,
51|you don't need to apologize.
51|You're not to blame.
51|Not the you sitting in front of me, anyway.
51|From now on, the two of us will have to face this destroyed world.
51|Don't block entrances and line up
51|Take care when train arrives
51|A terrifying world with no one in it—
51|a disgusting world where zombies roam free.
51|That is where we have to live our lives.
51|We need to support each other more than ever before.
51|My master...
51|You haven't done anything wrong.
51|Scene no. 557
51|Wholesale
51|What's up?
51|Uh, well...
51|I found something I'd like to try out.
51|What's the point of bursting those things?
51|Well, it's not a bad idea to mark the end of the Japanese summer that way.
51|Nah.
51|I really like the sound of enjoying a fireworks show all alone with you,
51|but while this world seems to be destroyed at a glance,
51|there might be survivors here, unlikely as it may be.
51|How should I put this?
51|People who are living in hiding, scared of the zombies that show up at night.

51|Okay, then.
51|Let's try waiting here until nighttime.
51|Okay!
51|Let's keep our expectations to a minimum, though.
51|Even if, by some chance, someone managed to survive and is now living in hiding,
51|I don't think they'd be lured out by mere fireworks.
51|Mankind was destroyed at the hands of vampires.
51|It'd be normal to consider this a trap.
51|Also—
51|Hey!
51|What's with that loud scream? It shouldn't have hurt you that badly.
51|Being too optimistic is not a good thing,
51|but neither is being too pessimistic.
51|Rather than waiting here thinking all along that it's pointless,
51|try and come up with a way to communicate with the survivors who take this bait.

51|Remember Platinum Disco, the superhit sung by me, Araragi Tsukihi?
51|Hearing someone else call their own song a superhit made me realize how weird it is.
51|I learned what the word "disco" meant first,
51|We actually came back to eleven years ago...
51|so I ended up thinking "dystopia" meant a really fun paradise.
51|Like, one better than utopia.
51|Huh? It just sold out?!
51|But we came this far!
51|Talk about a grave misunderstanding.
51|By the way, I also used to think "utopia" meant a utilitarian land.

52|Hey, Shinobu.

52|Like there's anyone else? Everyone is gone!

52|Should we check other houses just in case?
52|Whether it's just the Araragi house like this or the whole city...
52|I don't think it's worth it to check.
52|However, we need to confirm it.
52|We have that responsibility.
52|From there, not only did we inspect all our neighbors' houses, but all over town as well.

52|Right.
52|No good! The whole world? It's on such a scale I simply can't grasp the reality of it.
52|It's so shocking I can't even panic.
52|Karen and Tsukihi are missing.
52|Senjougahara, Hanekawa, Kanbaru, and Sengoku, they're nowhere to be seen.
52|Yet I can't bring myself to grieve and lament. Honestly, that's pretty shocking.
52|But I can't just sit here and cry about it.
52|As expected, this is...
52|But what does this mean? So, after Hachikuji's close call, and her life being extended...
52|...did something preposterous happen, causing the world to be destroyed?
52|No, I don't think that girl was of that caliber...
52|This means it's likely that, on the night of June 14th...
52|...after the evening papers were delivered, but before the morning ones, something happened.
52|Something of some nature happened, and the world was annihilated all in one shot. Not gradually.
52|I think that's what we can conclude from this.
52|Maybe this is some aberration-based phenomenon.
52|Only aberrations can act outside the forces of history and destiny, right?
52|That's why we could travel through time and prevent Hachikuji from turning into an aberration.
52|I see. That's a viable story.
52|My logic probably holds water.
52|Animation Number 116
52|Shinobu is thinking about something.
52|Animation Number 117
52|What's wrong, Shinobu?
52|I was trying to think of something, but I can't remember.
52|My memory really fails me.
52|What? Got a hunch?
52|About why the world's like this?
52|Just that.
52|Animation Number 122
52|She seemed like she was really troubled.
52|Animation Number 122
52|And if that's the case, about the aberration that turned the world into this mess?
52|I wonder if that's it...
52|For now, something came of this. We found out the date the world fell.
52|Right. But the question is what happened to the world that day and that night.
52|There's no counter without knowing that.
52|Counter? Even in this situation, you're thinking of doing something to counter it?
52|Well, if it's like people were spirited away...
52|If we solve that aberration problem, everyone can come back to this world, right?
52|I don't really know, to be honest.
52|Animation Number 128
52|Even if we can't fill in the two-month gap, we can at least correct the world to how it was originally.
52|Not like there's any certainty, though.
52|Animation Number 130
52|So I want to know why the world was annihilated.
52|I see.
52|Let's go look into the reason.
52|If we time slip again, to the evening of June 14th...
52|...what happened should become clear.
52|Evening Paper
52|Wednesday June 14th
52|What's wrong?
52|February, 1919
52|Donor
52|There's absolutely zero energy left.
52|I see.
52|The cause is, let's see... Probably that.
52|Huh? This is...
52|Animation Number 151
52|It's not the same type of talisman. What does this mean?
52|Rather than the type, the effect is different.
52|The talisman you got from Hawaiian-shirt guy is different in the histories before and after the change.
52|Different Effect
52|Animation Number 156
52|In short, not only is this about the world's fate, but various trivial details of history, like this, have also changed.
52|Though it's not trivial for us.
52|The talisman you attached dispersed the spiritual energy so that it didn't collect.
52|The talisman that's in front of us now is one that absorbs spiritual energy.
52|The spiritual energy necessary for a time warp
52|Animation Number 163
52|A-Absorbs?
52|has been absorbed
52|Animation Number 163
52|and we were never able to go back in time.
52|Animation Number 163
52|It's several orders of magnitude more extreme than the one you were given.
52|The result's the same in that you're preventing a great aberration war...
52|I see...
52|Well, I know this'll sound irrelevant and hypocritical...
52|Like a burst of anger
52|Animation Number 165
52|...but since nobody is listening, I'm going to say something selfish.
52|What'd you do, Oshino!
52|Well, that is selfish. It didn't matter to him which talisman was used because the result was the same.
52|But he's not so random he'd do something this drastic from sticky fingers or luck.
52|So I think there was a reason to in this history. But even if we found out, it's probably already pointless.
52|Right.
52|I'll just have to toss in some change and pray to the gods now.
52|Oh, wait...
52|If we peel this talisman off and wait patiently, wouldn't the so-called spiritual energies start to pile up again?
52|You!
52|Animation Number 181
52|This talisman is not the type that you or I...
52|...those who belong to the category of aberration, can touch.
52|I see. Then it's time to despair.
52|Despair it is.
52|Animation Number 196
52|Wh-What are these!
52|Zombies...
52|Rotten Corpses
52|Animation Number 205
52|Don't you move...
52|Caught between life and death for all eternity
52|Animation Number 207
52|As long as we're here, they can't creep in any closer.
52|Huh? Oh...
52|Buy why? Why can't they come any closer?
52|Probably the talisman. This is about the limit of how close they can get to it.
52|They probably know coming closer is dangerous.
52|They know?
52|For now, it seems we're safer to get away from here while this talisman is still effective.
52|Get away? Aren't we safe as long as we stay here?
52|As you can see, the numbers are increasing. I honestly can't grasp the full situation.
52|And well, because they're aberrations, I don't think they're our enemies.
52|And if they're the town residents turned into zombies, you can't just mow them down!
52|You're right.
52|So for now, we're going to make our escape!
52|For now, we've managed to escape!
52|Yeah, but what in the world were they?
52|I don't know... But wait, they probably weren't zombies, but rather...
52|What the hell...
52|I can't possibly have an excuse for this. A mishap I can't atone for...
52|I didn't think because I slipped through time and tried to change the past, I'd turn all humanity into zombies...
52|No, this is not something you need to worry over.
52|I'm to blame.
52|It's all my fault.
52|What do you mean? I'm happy you care for me, but Shinobu, I was the one...
52|No, I'm not saying this to cover for you.
52|It is an undeniable fact. It is the hard truth.
52|Shinobu!
52|It's okay, just listen.
52|First off, those aren't zombies. Those are what used to be vampires.
52|Vamp——ire
52|Animation Number 291
52|Vampires?
52|I guess you could say they're just like you.
52|Because all of them, just like you, were humans who I turned into vampires.
52|Animation Number 300
52|You did?
52|Right.
52|In other words, in this version of history, the one that annihilated the world...
52|...is me.
52|We maintained an altitude of 300 m and waited for sunrise.
52|And dawn...
52|Right around when the sun rose from the eastern sky, the swarm of zombies simply disappeared from the land.
52|22nd of August
52|So what do you mean that it's your fault, Shinobu? Tell me.
52|My fault.
52|Or rather, it's the fault of who I am in this version of history.
52|By "this version of history," you're talking about the Oshino Shinobu in this history that we changed, right?
52|Main Street
52|93
52|Right. Myself in this world... the me that isn't myself...
52|...turned all of humanity into vampires two months ago. That's what I mean.
52|June 14th.
52|I finally remembered what day that was, just moments ago.
52|What day that was?
52|You should remember it as well. It should've been a rather memorable day.
52|Doesn't it ring any bells?
52|It was the day that the world was annihilated. Of course it's going to be rather memorable.
52|The night of June 14th, or even June 15th...
52|No, not that! I mean the original evening of June 14th. What happened that night in the original history.
52|June 14th...
52|14th... 14th...
52|Let's see, it was Wednesday, so the 15th was a Thursday...
52|Guess it's not ringing a bell.
52|Maybe you'll get it if I say that June 15th was the day before what you called the school festival.
52|Looks like you realized what it was.
52|Yeah...
52|You really are the worst guy. It was the day of your first date with your girlfriend.
52|Parking
52|It was the day that the ex-class Prez, who you keep saying is the one saved your life, faced a dire crisis.
52|It was the day I ran away from home and that Hawaiian-shirt guy left town.
52|And you had completely forgotten all of that!
52|But what does all that matter? I still don't get it.
52|It's true all sorts of things happened, but the world wasn't annihilated or anything.
52|If anything, it'd be Black Hanekawa running rampant, which would be tied to an aberration phenomenon...
52|No, there's an association with Black Hanekawa as part of the phenomenon...
52|...but what's important is my having run away from home.
52|You having run away from home? But that was something solved rather uneventfully...
52|No, that's not true.
52|It was solved rather uneventfully only in the history that we know, that we experienced.
52|So, in this history, some event resulted from it?
52|Is she saying it wasn't resolved?
52|I ended up never talking to you about the details of my having run away from home...
52|...and you chose not to ask me.
52|I was grateful for your understanding. Therefore, I'm not going to go into the details now.
52|But I will disclose one fact that I can't keep hiding anymore.
52|Sure. Go ahead.
52|I was planning on annihilating the world if you hadn't found me that day.
52|That event was that important? W-Why?
52|Merely being desperate, or rather, taking out my aggression on others.
52|So, in this world—this is rather confusing, but—
52|In this version of history, Araragi Koyomi was unable to find you on June 14th?
52|That's probably what happened.
52|Animation Number 449
52|Think about it.
52|The one that realized I had run away from home in the first place was that lost girl.
52|No, it's not just limited to that day.
52|Hachikuji. If Hachikuji doesn't exist as an aberration...
52|...not only would the events of June 14th not happen, but I never would've met Hachikuji that Mother's Day.
52|5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
52|May
52|So, the Araragi Koyomi of this world is an Araragi Koyomi that has never met Hachikuji Mayoi.
52|Namashiro Residential Complex
52|I see. If that's the case, Black Hanekawa probably killed me that night.
52|Shinobu, this is another question that if you don't want to, you don't have to answer, so listen with a light heart.
52|Honestly, I didn't think about this question, nor did I ever want to think about it...
52|But how does it work?
52|You and I have tied ourselves to each other, all the way from spring break up to now.
52|In this situation, if you or I...
52|If one of us dies from an unfortunate accident, what happens to the other?
52|Because we tied ourselves together, will one death cause the other to die?
52|Or...
52|The answer is "Or."
52|That airhead of a cat girl probably never understood this...
52|...but at the least, the Hawaiian-shirt guy probably knew.
52|You were told before, right?
52|You can go back to being a human whenever you want. All you need to do is abandon me.
52|In other words, if we flip that thought and I were to die...
52|...you'd regain your powers and become the most powerful, legendary vampire.
52|You could revert back into an iron-blooded hot-blooded cold-blooded vampire.
52|Iron-blooded
52|Animation Number 481
52|Hot-blooded
52|Animation Number 481
52|Cold-blooded
52|Animation Number 481
52|Vampire
52|Animation Number 481
52|And I took the idea of annihilating the world seriously.
52|Specifically, I turned everyone in this town...
52|Everyone in Japan...
52|Everyone in the world...
52|Into vampires.
52|You turned all humans into vampires, huh?
52|Since the Industrial Revolution, the world population has

52|Well, in reality, I probably only directly sucked blood from the first few people.
52|Those select few, like me, would become vampires that want to destroy the world...
52|...and keep sucking the life out of everyone around them.
52|Trace the vampires born that way back to their roots and you would find my servants.
52|Vampires that wanted to destroy the world just like I did.
52|And so, like a pyramid scheme, the numbers increase in a geometric progression...
52|...and before you know it, it destroyed the world. Or rather, what you call humanity.
52|But, according to that theory, I'm dead, but you're not, right?
52|Where and what are you doing in this history?
52|What about you, after you destroyed this world? Well...
52|You're here, so...
52|I believe that I'm already dead in this version of history.
52|Dead?
52|It's obvious. There's only one person that can kill me at full power...
52|And that is none other than myself.
52|In other words, suicide.
52|And because I died, all the vampire servants turned into zombies.
52|In order to return from vampire to human, there was the thought of killing you with my own hands.
52|But if you're already dead, there's no way to get them all back to normal.
52|We have to just let the vampiric blood run rampant.
52|I'm sorry.
52|I didn't mean to do this.
52|I just wanted you to find me.
52|But with that pouting, child-like reason, I destroyed the entire world that you held dear.
52|Stop it.
52|Don't apologize.
52|Don't blame yourself.
52|It's true that the version of you in this history destroyed history itself, but that's not you.
52|Th-That's right, but it's still me.
52|In any case, Shinobu, you don't have to apologize anymore; you didn't do anything wrong.
52|At least the "you" who is standing in front of me right now.
52|From here on, just the two of us, in this ruined world...
52|Don't block entrances and line up
52|Take care when train arrives
52|In this horrible world where nobody else exists and tons of zombies run around...
52|...we have to keep living.
52|We need to help each other now more than ever.
52|You...
52|You didn't do anything wrong, Shinobu.
52|Wholesale
52|What's wrong?
52|Well, uh...
52|I want to try something out.
52|What's the point of launching those?
52|Though, it could be good to decorate the end of summer.
52|True, it's pretty stylish to enjoy fireworks all alone with you.
52|This world looks like it's been annihilated, but perhaps there's a one-in-a-million chance...
52|...someone may still have survived.
52|How to put it... Like people hiding in fear of the masses of zombies that show up every night.
52|So that the light of the fireworks could reach as far as possible...
52|Three Days Later, Afternoon
52|Animation Number 614
52|The Big Fireworks Day

52|Now, let's wait for a while until it turns into night.
52|Yeah.
52|Well, that said, let's not have any strange expectations.
52|Even if there really is a chance someone survived through all this and is living in hiding...
52|...I don't think they'd be lured out here by fireworks of this sort.
52|Mankind was annihilated at the hands of vampires, so it'd be natural for them to think this a trap.
52|Besides...
52|Come now!
52|That didn't hurt so much that you should yell that loud.
52|It's not good to expect too much, but you can't do anything if you're being overly pessimistic.
52|If you just wait thinking it's useless, nothing will come of it.
52|It'd be better to think about how you'd communicate with a survivor who was lured out by this
52|The person might not be a girl of junior high age.
52|True.

52|You know that famous song by Araragi Tsukihi, "Platinum Disco"?
52|Hearing you say this just make me feel like ignoring you.
52|Knowing the meaning of the word "Disco",
52|Back to the age of the Ten Wonders...
52|I had assumed "Dystopia" meant some kind of wonderful utopia.
52|I really thought dystopia surpassed utopia!
52|Eh? Sold out moments ago?
52|And here we came just for them!
52|That's quite a bold misconception.
52|By the way, I also believed "Utopia" meant a city of academic excellency,
52|because I had learned the word for "Academic excellency" beforehand.
52|"Discopia" in "Excellencia" then? Now, do you know what a "Shakespeare" is?
52|This world deserves to be destroyed...

53|That's risky, you know.

53|What the heck was that?
53|Was it supposed to be an SOS signal?
53|Well, it won't work.
53|Nobody'll actually respond to that.
53|I...
53|I'm Araragi Koyomi.
53|Would you mind telling me your name?
53|Hachikuji Mayoi.
53|I see.
53|You were alive.
53|You've been alive all this time.
53|Unbelievable.
53|I can't believe there was a survivor,
53|let alone the fact that it was a friend of yours.
53|She... survived.
53|Scene no. 59
53|What's wrong?
53|You look like you're about to cry. Were you that scared?
53|Nah, it was just surprising.
53|I'm really happy to have met a survivor.
53|Hmm? But it shouldn't be.
53|There's a whole bunch of survivors.
53|I'm the only one left in this area, though.
53|Anyway, let me confirm this one more time.
53|Did you say you were Araragi Koyomi?
53|Yes, that's right.
53|I see.
53|So you're Araragi, huh?
53|That... sounds like she knows me.
53|Scene no. 69
53|I'm glad I came.
53|Never thought I'd actually get to see you.
53|I'm shocked!
53|So Araragi Koyomi actually existed, huh?
53|Oh, yeah, I heard you'd be with a blonde girl.
53|You heard?
53|I heard you'd be flirting with a blonde girl.
53|Who the hell told you something that specific?!
53|Who? Well...

53|a guy named Oshino.

53|Unnumbered Scene
53|I have here with me a letter from him to you.
53|Scene no. 81
53|Hey, Araragi. I've been waiting for you.
53|You always make me wait.
53|I want you to take a look at Hachikuji. She's probably standing in front of you.
53|A mysterious high schooler apparently saved her life when she was a little kid.
53|I'd heard about it before the eventful Golden Week with all that stuff involving Ms. Class Rep.
53|It was back when I was going around town collecting oddity tales.
53|That's when I got to know Hachikuji.
53|The moment I heard it, I knew.
53|I knew that it was obviously referring to you two.
53|I assume this means you traveled back in time to save her?
53|But you guys are probably under a grave\n misunderstanding with regards to time travel.
53|The reality is that destiny can't be changed by traveling back in time.
53|Let's say the world in which you have an amicable relationship with Shinobu is Route A,
53|and that this destroyed world is Route X.
53|I'm guessing you intended to travel back in Route A's time—back to eleven years in the past.
53|However, where you ended up wasn't eleven years ago in Route A,
53|but eleven years ago in Route X.
53|Once you fulfilled your objective, you traveled eleven years into Route X's future—
53|you traveled downward to this present day, basically.
53|Please, Araragi.
53|You too, Shinobu.
53|Could you save the world?
53|I'm sure you've already realized that Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade destroyed the world,
53|but do you know she's still alive and endangering the barely-surviving human race?
53|She failed to commit suicide.
53|She's still alive.
53|And suicide wasn't the only thing she failed at.
53|She also failed in the creation of her servants.
53|It is said that a vampire's servants are their clones.
53|That's exactly why continuing to clone yourself will, due to cell deterioration, end in failure.
53|Defective vampires.
53|Those are the zombies I'm sure you've already laid eyes on in disbelief.
53|By the way, Heart-under-blade went into hiding after her suicide attempt.
53|I'm currently looking for her.
53|I've teamed up with a violent exorcist and a swindler I know.
53|The three of us plan to launch a final attack, but it'll probably end up a fruitless endeavor.
53|The human race has been turned into zombies, but they're not perfect servants of Heart-under-blade.
53|They're imperfect, and can be turned back into humans.
53|I wonder if I can call this a "hope."
53|But at the end of the day, it is but a truly naive thought.
53|A serious Heart-under-blade—
53|an insane Heart-under-blade—
53|can't be stopped by anyone.
53|Anyone other than you two, that is.
53|Anyone other than the people involved, that is.
53|In saying that, I know that you'll probably think you can't possibly stop a vampire in her heyday in your current state.
53|Well, that's fine.
53|I can't force you.
53|To you two, the destruction of this world is nothing but an event in a different route.
53|"Please save the world" is just my selfish request.
53|You don't need to pay heed to it at all.
53|But Araragi,
53|you should save the girl in front of you.
53|Your beloved friend,
53|Oshino Meme.
53|P.S: By the way, Route X's Araragi was dating Senjougahara, surprisingly enough.
53|Who are you going out with in your world?
53|Scene no. 81
53|If a guy called Araragi Koyomi had a blonde little girl with him,
53|I was told to hand that letter over to him.
53|That's what that Oshino guy told me.
53|Oshino...
53|Thank you very much.
53|You were a huge help.
53|Hey, Araragi.
53|Hachikuchi brought up something else.
53|Scene no. 94
53|If you have nowhere to go,
53|do you wanna come with me?
53|I'm pretty sure I can take care of two kids by myself.
53|I'm living in a place nearby right now.
53|My mom used to live there in the past.
53|Scene no. 98
53|All said and done, I feel lonely by myself too.
53|Is that so?
53|You're a kind person, Hachikuji.
53|That's not true.
53|You see, a kind stranger helped me out back when I was a little kid.
53|So I decided to be as nice to strangers as possible, is all.
53|Is that so?
53|Well, how about it?
53|I could offer you some tea.
53|Thanks for the offer,
53|but we have somewhere to go.
53|Really?
53|Yes. We need to hurry.
53|Sorry.
53|The fireworks weren't a signal or anything.
53|We were just having fun.
53|Wow, you guys are really weird.
53|Yes. We're weirdos.
53|Don't worry.
53|You'll stop feeling lonely soon.
53|Sorry for making you run a fool's errand.
53|Don't be.
53|I managed to deliver the letter I was entrusted with.
53|Hey.
53|Say, Araragi.
53|Have we met before?
53|Her question stops me in my tracks.
53|Scene no. 121
53|Who knows?
53|That's what I answered. I think I was smiling.
53|Scene no. 123
53|We could've passed each other somewhere.
53|There are streets anywhere and everywhere in this country.
53|No, that's not what I meant.
53|We haven't.
53|I'm just a passerby.
53|That said, I'm truly thankful you're alive.
53|And just like that...
53|Scene no. 127
53|Without looking back
53|Scene no. 129
53|Are you really okay with that, my master?
53|Surely you had loads to talk about.
53|Nope.
53|She doesn't know me in this world.
53|I managed to see her thanks to Oshino,
53|but in this route, our relationship ended without us ever meeting each other.
53|Delicious Milk
53|So what are you going to do?
53|What do you mean?
53|Are you going to save the world?
53|No.
53|I'm going to save a girl.
53|Will you help me?
53|Very well.
53|I said we'd die together, did I not?
53|So you think we're gonna die after all?
53|We don't stand a chance against a full-blooded vampire.
53|Not with a two-man cell consisting of a half-assed vampire like me and a half-assed human like you.
53|Probably.
53|But I'm not doing this because Oshino asked me to.
53|I just can't let the route where Hachikuji's alive stay as the one where the world's destroyed.
53|I want the route where she's alive to be a good one.
53|Why, yes. Destroying the world just by living?
53|What the hell kind of femme fatale is that?
53|Femme fatale, eh?
53|It's difficult to change the world on your own,
53|but twisting it a little might not be all that hard.
53|It doesn't have to be the entire world.
53|Anybody can add a twist to a story, right?
53|Twistory, huh?
53|We'll be the ones adding the twist here, though.
53|Trying to act cool, are we?
53|I'm not gonna deny it.
53|Shinobu laughed.
53|Scene no. 161
53|How are you going to twist this, my master?
53|It was a warm and pleasant laugh.
53|Scene no. 162
53|Let's see.
53|I guess I'll start with twisting the world to save a girl I know.
53|Black
53|Unnumbered Scene
53|So you're going to choose a lone girl over the entire world?
53|How trendy.
53|It's old-fashioned now.
53|Save the world and save the girl.
53|That avarice is what defines the modern-day hero, right?
53|Right.
53|You can say that again.
53|Well, we'll be together in death,
53|so I suppose we're even more inseparable in life.
53|It made me chuckle too.
53|Scene no. 171

53|Jiangshi.
53|Oddities from the mainland, basically.
53|Unlike vampires, who are disconnected from the concept of death,
53|I suppose I should call them "living corpses."
53|I had a conversation about that with Ononoki.
53|February, 1919
53|Donor
53|Compared to the soft and mushy-sounding zombies,
53|Jiangshi have the image of being a lot tougher.
53|That sounds to me like they remind you of rigor mortis.
53|Anyway, one usually has to pay the appropriate price to resurrect the dead.
53|Price, huh?
53|Well, I didn't exactly try to reanimate her,
53|but considering the fact that trying to save Hachikuji still led to the world's destruction,
53|that sounds pretty convincing to me.
53|It's not a fair trade though, is it?
53|Yeah.
53|I'm never going to accept that the world was destroyed simply because Hachikuji survived.
53|Even if fate itself said so.
53|That'd mean the world didn't need her. And there's just no way that's true.
53|Dead or alive,
53|girl or woman,
53|the world isn't complete without her.
53|Indeed.

53|Shall we summon our much-hated enemy?
53|Please do so.
53|Now we can no longer run or hide.
53|I don't plan to do either.
53|What is your plan, then?
53|Well, I don't have one.
53|How like you, my master.

53|So I really did try to burn myself to death, eh?
53|Just like that man.
53|Pathetic.
53|Purity in Spirit
53|I went that far and still couldn't die.
53|My immortality is absurd, even if I do say so myself.
53|No, I suppose I should call this just deserts.
53|I knew you.
53|I met you.
53|And yet I stooped so low.
53|This is nothing but failure.
53|Purity in Spirit
53|Why did you want to die?
53|Damn me!
53|Half her body was terribly burned— she didn't want to be alive.
53|Scene no. 278

53|I see.
53|That kind of future existed too, huh?
53|Along with that kind of world,
53|and that kind of route.
53|So there was indeed a possibility that you and I could be that close.
53|This is classic.
53|Yet I ruined it all with my pathetic jealousy.
53|I lost you because I ran away.
53|It made me feel like I had one of my wings ripped off—like I was ripped in half,
53|but it wasn't this painful.
53|It wasn't as painful as having that possibility shoved into my face.
53|Let me say this:
53|there shouldn't have been that big a difference between you and I.
53|Our social circle was a little different, is all.
53|I'm sure the requirements were pretty similar.
53|And whatever difference there was, I should've been able to make up for it!
53|By making the tiniest of compromises!
53|You only had to open your heart up to this man just a little bit more.
53|You only had to trust him with yourself.
53|That way, you and I would've been the same!
53|History would've gone down the right path!
53|Frankly speaking, I haven't a clue why you failed!
53|Being told off like that actually makes me feel good instead.
53|Well, I haven't a clue why you succeeded!
53|I'd like to have a walkthrough.
53|You there, the me from another world.
53|And you too, my servant from another world.
53|I shall send you back to your world.
53|What do you mean?
53|Well, you two don't wish to have a nice, long stay in this destroyed world—the world I destroyed—do you?
53|Indeed.
53|But we don't have enough energy to go back.
53|In that case...
53|all you need to do is turn me into the energy you need.
53|Half-dead as I may be,
53|I'm still Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade.
53|If you turn me into spiritual energy,
53|it should be possible to travel to another route, don't you think?
53|That's right.
53|In his entire letter, Oshino never said anything— not a word, not even an alphabet—
53|about wanting us to defeat Kiss-shot.
53|Facing her like this and showing ourselves to her was all we needed to do.
53|Just that much was enough to save her,
53|and save the world.
53|By "the girl in front of you," he was also referring to six hundred-year-old Kiss-shot.
53|Turn you into spiritual energy?
53|Are you telling me to suck your blood?
53|This goes without saying, but that's right.
53|This goes without saying, but you'll die.
53|This goes without saying, but I'm basically dead already.
53|That so?
53|Say, my servant from a different route.
53|I'm not asking for compensation or a trade here.
53|I'm simply asking you for a favor.
53|Could you please pat me on the head?
53|Gladly.
53|Scene no. 384
53|21st of August
53|Did we make it back?
53|What do you think happened to that world?
53|I hope they all came back to life—
53|or well, turned back into humans.
53|I don't think it would've been possible for all of them.
53|A considerable number of people died from the riots before being turned into oddities, I'd imagine.
53|Above all, you died before I went berserk. You won't come back to life.
53|Not much that can be done about that.
53|We'd decided to die together, remember?
53|Well, there was a two-month lag in there, so you can't exactly say it was "together,"
53|but I'm sure the Araragi of that route was content to die with you.
53|And I'm sure I was as well.
53|Hang on. What time is it now?
53|Crap! The opening ceremony's already begun!
53|What am I to do?!
53|Hanekawa and Senjougahara are gonna yell at me!
53|I'm done for! They're gonna kill me!
53|Better stay on your toes so that doesn't happen, my master.
53|We now know that I might destroy the world if you up and died.
53|You should probably rethink your fighting style.
53|Good grief.
53|That truly felt like "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
53|Not that I've read it.
53|Scene no. 411
53|Anyway, what'll I do if this world's been destroyed as well?
53|And what if it's safe, but a completely different world?
53|What if we screwed up and ended up coming to another different route?
53|Araragi!
53|I've been looking everywhere for you!
53|Starting early this morning, I ran a town-wide search with the Araragi residence at the center,
53|but I still couldn't find a single trace of you.
53|I was worried sick that you'd gone off to a different dimension or something!
53|I am so glad you're all right!
53|Let me hug you more!
53|Let me touch you more!
53|Let me lick you more!
53|Nooo!
53|This is a different route!
53|This is a fake Hachikuji!
53|Huh? Different route? Fake Hachikuji?
53|What are you talking about?
53|Did your brain finally melt away in this heat?
53|My brain's not made of Häagen-Dazs!
53|I went out on a limb and showered you with the affection you've been craving for so long,
53|and that lame reaction is how you repay me?
53|Araragi, I forgot my backpack at your place yesterday.
53|So I was running all over the place in a bid to get it back before you looked inside.
53|You don't trust me one bit, huh?
53|Hey, Hachikuji.
53|Do you love me?
53|Huh?
53|No way! Of course not!
53|If I had to say, I actually hate you.
53|So this really is a different route?!
53|Is this a parallel world?!
53|What?
53|The contents of your skull are what's parallel.
53|That makes no sense.
53|I'm just saying your brain's all yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
53|It still makes no sense to me, but I kinda get it now.
53|I'm amazed at how good you are at conveying malice!
53|By the way, Pararagi.
53|That is the worst time to bite your tongue!
53|Makes it sound like I'm the fake here!
53|Do it properly.
53|My name's Araragi!
53|Sorry! I bit my tongue.
53|No, you did it deliberately.
53|I bwit my twongue!
53|It wasn't deliberate?
53|I bwinged!
53|She shortened it!
53|Was that short for "I bit my tounge, I did"?!
53|What superb skill
53|Scene no. 469
53|I don't sense a single drop of remorse for making that mistake from you!
53|There's no doubt about it.
53|I find it hard to believe that Hachikuji could've honed her skills this much in any other route.
53|This girl is the Hachikuji Mayoi that came to be after several months of interacting with me.
53|What's are you smirking for? So creepy.
53|Nothing, really.
53|Okay, fine.
53|You want your backpack, right?
53|I wanted to return it to you as well.
53|Let's go pick it up from my place.
53|Scene no. 478
53|Let's ride back on my bike. Can you get on?
53|I don't want to ride pillion with you.
53|Scene no. 480
53|I just got back from a pretty crazy adventure, so I'd like to ride back if possible.
53|Scene no. 480

53|Scene no. 480
53|Relax.
53|Scene no. 480
53|Oh, right.
53|You were there with me.
53|Scene no. 480
53|Let me do this before I forget.
53|Yes?
53|Have you ever wanted to come back to life?
53|Never.
53|Pretty soon, I'll be dead longer than I was alive.
53|Is that how it works?
53|That's how it works.
53|Why?
53|For some reason.
53|You've been told you can go back to being human, but you won't do it either, right?
53|Well, yeah.
53|That's how I feel.
53|We're both the same, then.
53|We are.
53|So are you happy as a ghost?
53|I'm unhappy I became a ghost.
53|But I'm happy I met you.
53|So if you look at it on the whole, then yes, I am indeed happy.
53|I couldn't meet my mother when I was alive,
53|but thanks to dying with regrets,
53|I got to meet you.
53|Yeah.
53|We met.
53|While making nonsensical small-talk like always,
53|looking back occasionally,
53|making occasional mistakes,
53|and occasionally losing our way,
53|we took each step firmly as we walked down
53|this route.

54|A beautiful woman, tall and tough
54|Animation Number 37
54|Yes, that was us.
54|Hmm, I see. Then it was a good thing I came to take a look.
54|It's dangerous to do stuff like that.
54|With enough willpower, they can still move during the day.
54|What, were you trying to send an SOS?
54|That's no good! No one will help if you do stuff like that.
54|I'm... My name is Araragi Koyomi.
54|If I asked you for your name, would you mind?
54|It's Hachikuji Mayoi-san.
54|I see... So you stayed alive.
54|You stayed alive... all the way to today.
54|This isn't something I can readily believe. Not only is there a survivor...
54|...but that survivor is someone you know?
54|You—— survived.
54|Animation Number 59
54|What's wrong? You're about to cry. Was it that scary?
54|No, well, I was just surprised.
54|Meeting someone still alive, well, made me very happy.
54|Oh? It's not like everyone's gone. There are still quite a few people alive.
54|Though I may be the last one around here.
54|Oh, wait. Can I ask again?
54|Araragi Koyomi?
54|Yes, that's right...
54|I see. So you're Araragi-kun.
54|Then I'm glad I've come!
54|To think I'd actually be able to meet you... What a surprise!
54|I see, I see! So Araragi Koyomi-kun does exist!
54|Come to think of it, he did say that a blonde girl would be with you.
54|He did say?
54|He said you'd be all flirty with a blonde girl.
54|Who would say something that specific?
54|Who, you ask? The man who taught me that rice showers are effective against those zombies.
54|A guy named Oshino.
54|Black Scene
54|Animation Number 'none'
54|I actually have a letter for you which he entrusted to me.
54|Hey, Araragi-kun, I've been waiting for you. You always had a knack for making me wait.
54|Look at Hachikuji-san, probably standing there in front of you.
54|Apparently, a mysterious high schooler saved her life when she was a child.
54|I'd heard about this before Golden Week, back when all the stuff with Class Prez happened.
54|It's a story I heard when gathering the stories of aberrations.
54|I met Hachikuji-san around that time. It immediately rang a bell.
54|That's right. Needless to say, they were talking about you. I suppose you slipped through time to save her?
54|But you probably have a big misunderstanding about the concept of time travel.
54|Clearly, in reality, it is absolutely impossible to change fate via time travel.
54|Let's call the world where you're amiable with Shinobu route A...
54|...and call this annihilated world route X.
54|You probably warped trying to get to the past of route A, to 11 years in the past...
54|But where you warped to was not 11 years ago in route A, but 11 years ago in route X.
54|And after you completed your objective...
54|...you warped to present-day route X. In other words, you vertically crossed over to this world.
54|Please Araragi-kun, and Shinobu-chan, can you save our world?
54|You're probably aware that Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade
54|was the one who annihilated this world.
54|But do you know that she's still alive, and a menace to the few people left who are barely surviving?
54|She failed to commit suicide. She is alive.
54|And not only did she fail to commit suicide, she also failed when she sired her minions.
54|The vampires she sired are like copies of herself.
54|That's why, like how cells deteriorate if you keep making clones, she failed.
54|Failures of vampires. That's what you've seen.
54|What you were surprised by: the zombies...
54|Also, Heart-Under-Blade has gone missing since her attempted suicide.
54|We're looking for her now. I've teamed up with a violent exorcist and a con artist...
54|...and we're going on a suicidal final assault. It will probably be a meaningless end.
54|However, all of the humans who were turned into zombies are not perfect creations.
54|In other words, they're imperfect minions. We can turn them back. Can I call this hope?
54|But that's only the sweetest of expectations.
54|Once she gets serious... Once she shows her sheer madness...
54|No one can stop her. That's right. No one other than you guys.
54|You might be thinking there's no way to stop...
54|...a full-power vampire since you two lost your powers.
54|Well, that's fine if so. I can't force you.
54|For you guys, this world's annihilation is on a different route.
54|"Please save this world" is my selfish wish, and there's no need for you to heed it.
54|But, Araragi-kun, it's good to save a girl that's right in front of you.
54|Your dear friend, Oshino Meme.
54|P.S. By the way, the Araragi-kun here in route X surprisingly ended up dating Senjougahara-san.
54|In your world, who did you end up dating?
54|Animation Number 81
54|If a boy named Araragi Koyomi was together with a young blonde girl...
54|...I was supposed to give that letter to him.
54|From that guy named Oshino.
54|Oshino...
54|Thank you very much. You saved us.
54|Hey, Araragi-kun.
54|Hachikuchi brought up something else.
54|Animation Number 94
54|If you don't have a place to go, would you like to come with me?
54|I'm resourceful enough to take care of two children.
54|I live in a house close by, now.
54|It was the house my mother used to live in.
54|All things said, well, I'm lonely by myself.
54|I see.
54|You're very kind, Hachikuji-san.
54|I don't think that's true.
54|But, well, a stranger was really nice to me back when I was a kid.
54|So, I've just always thought that I should be nice to strangers too.
54|I see...
54|So, what will you do?
54|I can probably serve some tea.
54|No, thank you for the offer, but we have somewhere to go.
54|Really?
54|Yes, we really have to go. I'm sorry.
54|The fireworks weren't any sort of communication signal. We were just playing.
54|That's... really strange.
54|Yes. We're strange.
54|It will be all right. It won't be long before you're not lonely anymore.
54|Sorry I made you come out here for no reason.
54|No, it was good that I could deliver the letter I was entrusted with.
54|Hey... Hey, Araragi-kun.
54|Have we met somewhere before?
54|Her question stops me in my tracks.
54|Animation Number 121
54|Who knows?
54|That's what I answered. I think I was smiling.
54|Animation Number 123
54|Though, maybe we passed by each other somewhere? Roads are everywhere in this country.
54|No, that's not what I mean...
54|We haven't. I'm just a passerby.
54|But thank you for staying alive.
54|And just like that——
54|Animation Number 127
54|Without looking back
54|Animation Number 129
54|Are you okay leaving it at that?
54|Didn't you have a lot to say?
54|Nope. In this world, she doesn't know me.
54|I was able to meet her like this thanks to Oshino...
54|...but in this route I never ended up meeting Hachikuji-san.
54|So, what do we do?
54|Delicious Milk
54|What do we do?
54|In other words, are we going to save the world?
54|No. I'm going to save a girl.
54|Will you help me?
54|That's inevitable.
54|I told you, when we die, we die together.
54|You think we'll die after all?
54|There's no way we can win.
54|The opponent is a full powered vampire while we're just a pair...
54|...consisting of a half-assed vampire and a half-assed human.
54|Perhaps.
54|But this isn't because Oshino asked.
54|I won't let the route where Hachikuji can survive be the route where the world is annihilated.
54|I want the route where she's alive to be good.
54|Well, surely, if she destroys a whole world just by living...
54|...it makes you wonder just how beautiful this femme fatale could be.
54|A beautiful femme fatale, huh?
54|It's difficult for a single human to change the world.
54|But maybe it's possible for them to tip the world over.
54|It doesn't have to be the world. Anyone can tip over a story.
54|An eccentric story, huh?
54|Though in this case, we're the ones who are eccentric.
54|You show-off.
54|I won't deny it.
54|And so, if you're going to be eccentric, how will you act on it?
54|Shinobu laughed——
54|Animation Number 161
54|Let's see... For starters, I'll tip over the world for the girl standing in front of me.
54|Black Scene
54|Animation Number 'none'
54|You mean you'd weigh the options and pick the girl instead of the world, huh?
54|That sounds so contemporary.
54|Oh, it's actually outdated.
54|You save the world, and you save the girl as well.
54|Such avarice is the portrait of contemporary heroes.
54|Indeed. Such words!
54|Well, since we're together in death, I guess we're even closer together in life.
54|It made me chuckle too.
54|Animation Number 171
54|That sounds good.

54|Kyonshi.
54|Well, I guess it's an aberration from China.
54|Unlike vampires, who are deprived of death from the beginning, they can be called "living corpses."
54|I remember talking to Ononoki-chan about that.
54|February, 1919
54|Donor
54|Though, unlike soft-looking zombies, I have the image that Kyonshi are pretty rigid.
54|I think that's just from the imagery of rigor mortis.
54|Well, in most cases, it means there's that much of a price to pay for reviving the dead.
54|A price, huh...
54|It's not like it's returning the soul to a corpse...
54|...but if the price for trying to save Hachikuji was the annihilation of the world...
54|...well, I think that's just how things are.
54|But that's a deal that isn't worth the price, after all.
54|Yeah.
54|I'm never going to accept the logic that, because Hachikuji was alive, the world was annihilated.
54|Even if that is destiny itself.
54|If so, it's as if she wasn't needed by the world.
54|That can't be.
54|No matter if she's alive or dead. No matter if she's a young girl or an adult.
54|Her being here is what makes this world worth it.
54|Indeed.
54|Black Scene
54|Animation Number 'none'
54|The time is waning in a good manner, so I think it's about time to summon our despicable enemy.
54|Please do.
54|Now running and hiding are out of the question.
54|I don't plan on doing either.
54|Then what are you planning to do?
54|Well, I really don't have a plan.
54|That is so like you.
54|Purity in Spirit

54|So I did choose to burn myself to death. Just like that man did...
54|How miserable.
54|Going that far, yet unable to die... I must say I'm at a foolish level of immortality.
54|No, I should say this was a rightful retribution.
54|Despite knowing you... Despite meeting you...
54|To degrade myself this far is nothing short of failure.
54|Why did I think about dying? Why did I!?
54|Half her body was terribly burned—— She didn't want to be alive.
54|Animation Number 278
54|Still she laughed loud and clear
54|Animation Number 279
54|and it made me shiver.

54|The strongest being that the world knows.
54|Animation Number 293
54|I see... It existed as well...
54|Such a future... Such a world...
54|Such a route...
54|The possibility that I could snuggle up to you like that really existed.
54|This is a masterpiece. Yet I, from silly jealousy, ruined it all.
54|My running away from home caused me to lose you...
54|...making me feel like I lost a wing, that I lost half of myself...
54|But it wasn't this heart-wrenching...
54|To be shown that such a possibility existed...
54|Let me tell you.
54|There shouldn't have been that huge of a difference between us.
54|The connections between the people around us were only slightly different.
54|Our conditions weren't so different.
54|They were all minute differences I could easily fill in.
54|If I had only made one tiny compromise.
54|If I'd only opened up my heart to this boy a little more...
54|Believing, and entrusting...
54|With that alone, we could have been the same.
54|History would have been corrected.
54|I'm going to be blunt. I have no idea how you could fail the way you did!
54|It feels good to be told off to that extent.
54|For me, how you succeeded is something I fail to comprehend.
54|I could use a strategy guide.
54|Myself from another world, and my minion from another world...
54|I will hereby return you to your original world.
54|What do you mean?
54|Well, you don't want to stay too long in this destroyed world that I annihilated, right?
54|Of course. But there's not enough energy stored up to do so.
54|If that's the case, then turn me into your energy.
54|Even half-dead, you have Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in her prime.
54|Turning me directly into spiritual energy should make at least one transfer to a different route possible.
54|That's right. In the letter, Oshino didn't have one line, not one letter written...
54|...that he wanted us to defeat Kiss-shot.
54|All it required was for us to face her like this and show ourselves to her.
54|With just that, her soul is saved.
54|And the world is saved.
54|When he said "the girl right in front of you," he also meant the 600-year-old Kiss-shot.
54|To turn you into spiritual energy...
54|In other words, you want me to drain your blood.
54|This goes without saying, but you're right.
54|This goes without saying, but you will die.
54|This goes without saying, but I'm already as good as dead.
54|I see.
54|Hey, my minion from another route...
54|This isn't a deal or a point to bargain with. This is merely me asking a favor.
54|Can you pat me on the head?
54|Gladly.
54|21st of August
54|Does this mean we managed to come back?
54|I wonder what happened to that world.
54|Hopefully everyone came back to life. Or rather, turned back into humans.
54|shinzou ni awasete hontou no kimochi o
54|I will convey my feelings my own way
54|I expect that not everyone was turned back.
54|There must've been a few who died being involved in the riots even before they turned into aberrations.
54|jibunrashiku saa hanasou
54|to match the excitement of my heart.
54|Above all, you wouldn't come back to life if you died before I ran out of control.
54|Well, I can't do anything about that.
54|We had decided that we'd die together.
54|heibon na kin’youbi ochikonda mainichi wa
54|It was a usual friday, even though I had
54|There was a two-month time lag to call it "together"...

54|felt so anxious and nervous before it.
54|...but being able to die with you was probably something the Araragi-kun of that route wanted as well.
54|sakusen o kangaete kono kimochi douyatte
54|I kept thinking of the battle plan
54|Of course, something I wanted as well.
54|iou kana tte kyou mo owaru
54|of how I can I convey my feelings.
54|Wait a minute. What time is it!
54|kimi no me ga oyoidara
54|Your eyes aren't focused on me
54|Not good! The ceremony already started.
54|fuan de shouganainda yo

54|What should I do? Hanekawa and Senjougahara are going to be so mad! They'll kill me!
54|shittoshichau iya da iya da tte uzumaite
54|“Don't be jealous!” I tell myself.
54|tamaranainda
54|I can't help it!
54|Best you be careful so that doesn't happen to you.
54|HONTO wa ne zutto kimi to
54|You know, I just wanted it
54|futari dake gayokattanda
54|to be the two of us.
54|Now that I know that if you die, I'm very likely to destroy this world.

54|Even if it isn't, maybe it's a completely different world.
54|Or we failed again and came to a completely different route...
54|tameiki o tsuite saa RISETTO shiyou
54|Let me take a deep breath and start over.
54|Araragi-san!
54|I've been looking for you, Araragi-san!
54|I've been searching since pretty early in the morning at the Araragi household, but I couldn't find you at all.
54|So I was worried that you'd gone off to an alternate dimension or something!
54|Well, I'm glad you were all right!
54|Let me hold you more! Let me touch you more!
54|Let me lick you more!
54|This is a different route! It's a fake Hachikuji!
54|Huh? A different route? Fake Hachikuji?
54|What are you talking about, Araragi-san? Did your brain finally melt in this heat?
54|My brain isn't made of Häagen-Dazs.
54|On a whim, I went and totally gave a service scene that has been in the works for a while now...
54|Such a cold reaction.
54|Araragi-san, I forgot my backpack in your room yesterday.
54|I wanted to get it before you looked inside, so I've been running all over since early this morning.
54|You don't even give me have a millimeter of trust.
54|Hey, Hachikuji. Do you really love me?
54|Huh? Oh, of course not. If I had to say love or hate, I'd actually say hate.
54|This is a different route! Is this a parallel world?
54|Huh? I thought the only thing parallel was your brain.
54|I don't understand!
54|I mean, your head is rarerare-rerureru-pappara-brain.
54|I still don't understand you, but I get it now!
54|How can you convey just the bad traits so accurately?
54|Now, Pararegi-san...
54|Don't bite your tongue like that based on how the conversation was going! It makes me sound like the fake!
54|Don't cut corners when you bite your tongue! My last name is Araragi!
54|Pardon me. I stuttered.
54|No, that was on purpose.
54|I st-stuttered.
54|It wasn't on purpose!?
54|I stut!
54|She abbreviated? Was that short for "I stuttered"?
54|I don't feel sincerity towards the mistake made at all!
54|No doubt about it.
54|I can't think that the Hachikuji that has such skilled abilities would be in just any route.
54|This Hachikuji here is the Hachikuji Mayoi...
54|...that was created over the past few months of interacting with me.
54|What are you grinning about? So gross!
54|Nothing... Well, okay, okay, the backpack.
54|I was thinking about delivering it to you too.
54|Oh, that's right. Hachikuji, one question before I forget.
54|Yes?
54|Have you ever thought about coming back to life?
54|Not at all. Soon I'll have been dead longer than I was alive.
54|So that's how it is?
54|That's how it is.
54|Why?
54|Just because.
54|It's the same for you, right? You wouldn't go back to being human, even if there was a way, would you?
54|Well, true. That's what I thought.
54|Then you and I are the same in that regard.
54|The same.
54|Then are you happy that you turned into a ghost?
54|Turning into a ghost was an unhappy thing.
54|But I am happy that I was able to meet Araragi-san.
54|And so, overall, I'm happy. Even though I couldn't see my mother while I was still alive.
54|Because I died and still had regrets, I was able to meet you, Araragi-san.
54|I guess so. We were able to meet one another.
54|We talked about silly idle chatter like we usually did.
54|Looking back every so often, making mistakes on occasion, and sometimes being lost...
54|...yet savoring each and every step we walk forward along this route.

55|you had a perfect score in all subjects, even PA and art, save for one single mistake.
55|Oh please, how do you remember that?
55|Would you happen to be stalking me?
55|Nah, that'd be reading a bit too much into it.
55|It's no big deal.
55|My alien friend told me.
55|Wait, you've got friends?!
55|That's more of a surprise than aliens?!
55|I didn't mean it like that.
55|It's just that you seem to prefer being alone, like a hermit or something.
55|Well, you're right. I've got no friends.
55|But you're so famous that even a loner like me knows about you.
55|Stop that.
55|Jokes like that aren't funny to me.
55|Say, Araragi.
55|Do you believe in vampires?
55|What about them?
55|I've been hearing some rumors lately about a vampire being in town.
55|They say you shouldn't stay out alone at night.
55|So vague and unfounded.
55|They say it's a very beautiful blonde woman
55|with eyes so cold it chills you to the bone.
55|And that makes them a vampire?
55|Couldn't it just be a normal human being who stands out because they're blonde?
55|Under the streetlights, her blonde hair almost shines,
55|yet she has no shadow.
55|Still, this happened at night.
55|It's not like streetlights make shadows unmistakably clear.
55|Yeah, I think it's a silly rumor too.
55|But if there was actually a vampire, I'd love to meet them.
55|I'm intrigued by such superhuman creatures.
55|Superhuman? Like gods?
55|It doesn't have to be a god.
55|It wouldn't be worth the trouble otherwise.
55|Ah, my bad.
55|You're so easy to chat with.
55|So easy I feel like I said stuff that doesn't make much sense.
55|It's weird you've got no friends when you're so fun to talk to.
55|Why don't you make friends?
55|If I made friends, I'd lose my power level.
55|What?
55|I don't think I'm following.
55|I really don't know how to word it.
55|If I had friends, I'd have to care about them.
55|If they got hurt, I'd be hurt too.
55|If they were sad, I'd be sad too.
55|Friends are just another weakness.
55|That's like an affliction for anyone.
55|But when your friends have fun, you'd have fun too.
55|When they're happy, you'd be happy too.
55|It doesn't necessarily have to be a weakness.
55|No.
55|Friends having fun would make me jealous.
55|Their happiness would just make me envious.
55|You're petty.
55|Give me a break.

55|I'll be heading to the library now.
55|Wanna come along?
55|Why?
55|What would I do in a library?
55|Study, of course.
55|Of course?
55|Alas, I'm not so diligent as to study during spring break when I don't even have any homework.
55|But next semester you'll have to prepare for university entry exams.
55|Naoetsu Private High School Entrance
55|University?
55|I'll be happy if I can graduate at all.
55|I'm not gonna make it, no matter what I do.

55|Uh, yeah?
55|Gimme.
55|Thanks. Here.

55|Indeed,
55|you shall help me.
55|Can you not hear me?
55|I said you shall help me.
55|Are...
55|Are you okay?
55|I'll get you an ambulance!
55|Ambulance?
55|I need no such thing.
55|I demand your blood.
55|Do you believe in vampires?
55|They say it's a very beautiful blonde woman
55|with eyes so cold it chills you to the bone.
55|I am Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade,
55|the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, and cold-blooded vampire.
55|I shall take your blood as my flesh.
55|Therefore, I demand your blood.
55|I thought vampires were immortal.
55|I lost too much blood.
55|Too much to even regenerate or transform.
55|I am about to die.
55|As a lowly human, you should consider becoming my flesh to be a great honor.
55|Blood?
55|Can't you get a transfusion or something?
55|How much do you need?
55|Everything you have should keep me alive for now.
55|I see. All I've got.
55|What's wrong?
55|I demand your blood!
55|Now! Hurry!
55|Hurry, you fool!
55|It's fine.
55|I can get away.
55|Can you imagine any honor greater than this?
55|I can get away from this.
55|What?
55|You must be jesting.
55|You refuse to help me?!
55|No!
55|No! No! I don't wanna die!
55|I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!
55|Help me! Help me, please!
55|Please, I beg you!
55|Help me...
55|No!
55|I'm sorry!
55|I would die.
55|She's a monster!
55|She's a vampire!
55|I don't have to help her.
55|Right?
55|I know, goddamn it!
55|Don't give up, you moron!
55|Are you okay with this?
55|Of course I'm not.
55|Damn it.
55|Why?
55|How did it come to this?
55|I swear I'll do better in my next life.
55|I'll be smart, and everything bad that happens will be everyone else's fault.
55|I'll be reborn into someone like that.
55|I'll help you.
55|Take my blood.
55|I give it all to you.
55|Every last drop of it.
55|Suck me dry.
55|Thank you.
55|Was it a dream?
55|Hey!
55|Wake up.
55|Just five more minutes.
55|Wake up already!
55|Not feeling it right now.
55|How long are you gonna sleep?!
55|Like 4.6 billion years.
55|That's enough to create Earth all over again!
55|It's been two days?
55|Fool!
55|Good grief.
55|How stupid do you have to be to jump right into the sunlight?
55|Your average vampire would evaporate in an instant.
55|Never go outside again while the sun is up.
55|You are immortal, so you would burn and regenerate, and burn and regenerate forever.
55|That is, if you consider the undead to be alive in the first place.
55|Undead?
55|Wait, are...
55|I very much am Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade.
55|Call me Heart-under-blade.
55|It has been 400 years since I made my last kin.
55|You are my second.
55|Seeing your regeneration earlier,
55|I'd call it a great success.
55|Kin?
55|Indeed! Therefore you—
55|That reminds me. I have yet to get your name.
55|Not that I need to.
55|The name you bore once before is meaningless hereafter.
55|Welcome to the world of the night,
55|my servant.
55|Where...
55|Where are we?
55|I believe it was called a cram school.
55|It went bankrupt a few years ago and is abandoned now.
55|A suitable place to withdraw to.
55|Next question, Kiss-shot.
55|Hold on!
55|I told you to call me Heart-under-blade!
55|That's way too long.
55|I prefer Kiss-shot. It's short.
55|Can't I call you that?
55|Oh well.
55|If you prefer it, so shall it be.
55|I have no reason to forbid it.
55|So?
55|What is your next question?
55|I turned into a vampire, right?
55|Is it not obvious?
55|Do I need to spell it out for you?
55|You became my kin, my servant.
55|Consider it an honor.
55|Your servant...
55|Why do you have a child's body now?
55|Earlier you were more, uh, mature—
55|Sorry for not being more "mature"!
55|That's not what I meant.
55|I took all your blood,
55|but it was insufficient.
55|Therefore I took a form I could sustain.
55|Still better than perishing.
55|Then again, I can only sustain a minimum amount of immortality,
55|and most of my vampire powers are unavailable now.
55|Inconvenient indeed.
55|My limbs are restored, as you can see.
55|I could at least regenerate the form, if not the power to fill it.
55|This should suffice for now.
55|That said, do not forget that you are my servant.
55|I may look this way now, but I am a vampire who has lived for five centuries.
55|You are but a newborn as a vampire.
55|Know your place when you address me.
55|Oh.
55|Make your replies clear.
55|Do you really understand?
55|I do...
55|Then as a sign of your obedience, pat my head.
55|That should do.
55|Why did you turn me into a vampire?
55|I was prepared to die being sucked dry by you.
55|I did not intend to.
55|All who have their blood drunk by a vampire will, without exception, turn into vampires.
55|That is all.
55|I see...
55|It is quite convenient for me.
55|There is something I need you to do.
55|Your blood alone only allows me to regenerate so much.
55|I am far from my full potential.
55|Which is why you shall act in my stead.
55|What do you want from me?
55|Can I...
55|Can I return to being human?
55|I thought so.
55|I was prepared for that question.
55|So? Can I?!
55|You can.
55|I can guarantee that.
55|I give you my word if needed.
55|The names of three people who robbed Kiss-shot of parts of her body.
55|Those three are specialist vampire slayers.
55|They're the ones that killed you?
55|Are you out of your mind?
55|They have yet to finish me off.
55|However, they took my limbs.
55|I have very little regenerative power left too.
55|I have no chance of standing against them now.
55|You shall face those three and take back my limbs.
55|Huh?
55|"You shall" as if it was that simple.
55|To make you human once again, I must regain my full power.
55|I must be whole again.
55|My limbs are absolutely necessary for that.
55|But I can't fight at all.
55|Won't I just get slain instead?
55|Fool.
55|You still think as if you were human.
55|You are now my kin.
55|Now that I am weakened to a bare minimum,
55|while I am still a top-class vampire, you could still kill me.
55|So you're a weak vampire?
55|No!
55|You're weakened, so I might be stronger than you at this point,
55|but those three managed to take your limbs when you were whole and at full power.
55|How could I—
55|I was at a disadvantage because they came at me at once.
55|I took them lightly.
55|What I mean is that as long as you take on them one by one,
55|they shall stand no chance against you.
55|Simply put: it is an easy task.
55|What now?
55|Would you at least hear me out?!
55|I'm human!
55|Do you want to murder a fellow human?!
55|You seem so worked up.
55|Did something nice happen to you?
55|Huh?
55|Thanks for saving me.
55|No need for thanks.
55|You got saved on your own,
55|Araragi.
55|Don't be so alarmed.
55|Your stare's sharp.
55|You seem so worked up.
55|Did something nice happen to you?
55|Let's just go home for now, Araragi.
55|Home?
55|To that old abandoned cram school.
55|Huh?
55|Hold on a second!
55|How do you know about that?
55|Why are you surprised?
55|I'm the one who told her about it.
55|Failing to do the right thing is the sign of cowardice.
55|Heart-under-blade looked like she was in trouble, dragging your body around,
55|so I gave her a good spot.
55|Who are you?
55|I'm just an old fart who happened to pass by.
55|Don't worry.
55|I'm no vampire slayer or specialist.
55|I practice in a much wider field.
55|I'll introduce myself properly later.
55|You're back!
55|Who is that behind you?
55|I feel like I've met you before.
55|That's so mean.
55|Is that all you remember of me?
55|So?
55|How did it go?
55|This is a problem.
55|Those three are still working together.
55|They took you out even at your full power.
55|I stand no chance against them.
55|Which is why I told you to take them on one by one!
55|They're together. It's not happening.
55|You said we could just lay low, but who knows when they find us he—
55|Don't worry about that.
55|I drew up a boundary around here while you were asleep.
55|A boundary?
55|Like a barrier?
55|Something like that.
55|What's up with you, exactly?
55|Why did you help Kiss-shot and me?
55|I realize you're not an enemy,
55|but I doubt you'd be on our side either.
55|Jeez, you're so cruel.
55|I'm maintaining the balance.
55|Consider that my job.
55|I bridge this side and the other.
55|Introduce yourself.
55|You said you would.
55|Oshino Meme.
55|I'm like a rolling stone.
55|I'm kind of an authority on monsters and apparitions.
55|Unlike those three, I'm not great at exorcising though.
55|Not great?
55|Let me rephrase that.
55|I'm not a fan of it.
55|Doesn't that make you a specialist then?
55|Maintaining the balance is my specialty.
55|I negotiate from neutral ground.
55|Call me a mediator.
55|Negotiation?
55|Bridging this side and the other?
55|Where is "this side" and what's "the other"?
55|Are the two sides humans and monsters?
55|Monsters?
55|That's good.
55|I prefer to call them oddities though.
55|And she's the oddity slayer.
55|She's a rare kind of vampire who can drain energy from oddities.
55|That makes her pretty famous actually.
55|I listened to your little chat earlier.
55|Quite the pinch you're in.
55|I didn't expect things to take such a difficult turn.
55|There is nothing difficult about it.
55|It is extremely simple.
55|In the eyes of an undying vampire, maybe.
55|It's quite the trouble for us humans.
55|Right, Araragi?
55|Also, Heart-under-blade,
55|I liked how you agreed to return your kin Araragi to being human.
55|Should I mediate for you?
55|Between us and those three?
55|Who else?
55|So you'll help us?
55|No. But I'll lend you a hand.
55|The balance feels off as it is right now.
55|It's like I'm watching bullies get their way.
55|Of course, since it's my job, I'm not gonna do it for free.
55|Hm...
55|How about 2 million?
55|2 million?!
55|You pay when you can, and I won't bother you about it.
55|That much is the least I must ask to maintain the balance.
55|But...
55|Shall we hear your exact plan?
55|Negotiations sound nice, but it is not so easy.
55|Trying to convince those three is futile.
55|All I can do is ask
55|earnestly.
55|If asking doesn't work, more dangerous ideas get involved.
55|If we can at least communicate, we can play a game.
55|A game?
55|Firstly, we need to separate them.
55|You said dealing with them one by one shouldn't be an issue.
55|We should make that happen then.
55|Boy, how do you plan to negotiate with them in the first place?
55|The details are a trade secret.
55|I'll level the playing field,
55|and Araragi can get back your limbs.
55|If you regain your limbs, you also regain your full power,
55|which means you can return Araragi to human.
55|Servant!
55|I cannot procure human money.
55|I have no idea how heavy a debt of 2 million is.
55|Can you shoulder it?
55|Do not worry.
55|His skills are real.
55|I may be weak now, but even I can see that.
55|I don't have that much saved,
55|but if I get to pay when I can and you don't press me about it,
55|and I don't need collateral or a guarantor,
55|then I'll shoulder it.
55|Deal then.
55|Thanks for your patronage.
55|Just kidding.

56|You walk pretty fast,
56|Araragi-kun.
56|Araragi-kun
56|How do you know my name?
56|Eh?
56|Of course I know it.
56|We go to the same school.
56|Written with the "a" from "possibility,"
56|可 from 可能 (kanou)
56|A
56|two of the "ra" from "good kid,"

56|Your first name is the "Koyomi" for "calendar."
56|Koyomi
56|Right? Hence, "Araragi Koyomi-kun."
56|Araragi Koyomi
56|You're Hanekawa.
56|Hanekawa Tsubasa.
56|Hanekawa Tsubasa
56|Wow.
56|I'm amazed you know my name.
56|You're the "Hanekawa Tsubasa" who,
56|in our first semester finals as sophomores,
56|across all subjects including PE and Art,
56|made only one mistake.
56|Wait, what? How do you know all that?
56|Perhaps... you've been stalking me?
56|Or am I being too paranoid?
56|It's no big deal.
56|My alien friend told me.
56|Eh, you have friends?
56|At least question the "alien" part!
56|Well, about that...
56|I thought you were the type to always be by himself.
56|You're right about me not having friends.
56|That means you're so famous that
56|even a loner like me knows you.
56|Stop it.
56|I don't think that's funny.
56|Hey, Araragi-kun.
56|Do you believe in vampires?
56|Why bring up vampires?
56|Lately, some rumors have been circulating
56|about a vampire being in town.
56|So you shouldn't be out alone at night.
56|What a vague and baseless rumor.
56|They say it's a blonde, extremely beautiful woman.
56|With eyes so cold, they send chills down your spine.
56|That doesn't prove she's a vampire.
56|What if she just stands out because she's blonde?
56|While her blond hair glistens under the street lights,
56|she has no shadow.
56|But they saw her at night.
56|Even if there's a street light, it's still hard to see.
56|Yeah, I also think it's a silly rumor.
56|But if there really was a vampire, I'd love to meet them.
56|It'd be nice if such superhuman beings existed.
56|Superhuman? Like gods?
56|Doesn't have to be a god.
56|Otherwise, it wouldn't be worth the trouble.
56|My bad, my bad.
56|You're so easy to talk to.
56|I ran my mouth and probably some weird things.
56|It's odd that you're so easy to talk to
56|yet you don't have any friends.
56|Why don't you make any?
56|If I made friends, my humanity would decline.
56|What?
56|Sorry, I don't understand.
56|Well, uh, how do I put this...
56|If I had friends, I'd have to worry about them.
56|If they got hurt, I'd be hurt too.
56|If they were sad, I'd be sad too.
56|In a sense, they become your weaknesses.
56|They make humans weak.
56|But if your friends have fun, you'd have fun too.
56|If they're happy, you'd be happy too.
56|There's no rule saying they have to be weaknesses.
56|Nope.
56|If my friends have fun, I'd be jealous.
56|If they're happy, I'd just be envious.
56|You're so petty.
56|Gimme a break.
56|Naoetsu Private High School Entrance
56|I'm heading to the library now.
56|Wanna join me, Araragi-kun?
56|Why?
56|What are we doing there?
56|Studying, of course.
56|"Of course"?

56|University aside,
56|I might not even graduate.
56|No matter what, I won't make it.
56|Araragi-kun, do you have your phone?
56|Yeah, I do.
56|Gimme.
56|Thanks. Here you go.

56|Thou
56|shall help me.
56|Dost thou not hear me?
56|I said, thou shall help me.
56|H— Hey...
56|Are you alright?
56|I— I'm calling an ambulance!
56|Ambulance?
56|That is unnecessary.
56|Therefore...
56|Offer me thy blood.
56|Do you believe in vampires?
56|They say it's a blonde, extremely beautiful woman.
56|With eyes so cold, they send chills down your spine.
56|I am Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade...
56|the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire.
56|I shall consume thy blood as my flesh.
56|Therefore, offer me thy blood.
56|Aren't vampires... supposed to be immortal?
56|I've lost too much blood.
56|I can no longer regenerate or transform.
56|I am at death's door.
56|Worthless human,
56|'tis a privilege to become my flesh and blood.
56|B— Blood?
56|Can't you just get a transfusion?
56|H— How much do you need?
56|Thine body's worth is sufficient for the time being.
56|I see. My body's worth.
56|What is the matter?
56|Offer— Offer me thy blood!
56|Quickly! At once!
56|At once, you oaf!
56|It's okay.
56|I can run away.
56|Can thou imagine a greater honor?!
56|I can escape.
56|Run away.
56|Only by doing so,
56|can I deny this reality.
56|Hey!
56|S— Surely you jest.
56|Wilt thou... not help me?
56|Nooo!
56|No, no, no, no! I don't wanna die!
56|I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!
56|Help me! Help me, please!
56|P— Please, I beg thee!
56|Help me...
56|No!
56|Forgive me!
56|Forgive me.
56|Forgive me...
56|I'll die.
56|Besides, she's a monster!
56|A vampire!
56|I don't need to help her.
56|Right?
56|I fucking know that already!
56|Don't give up, stupid!
56|R— Really?
56|Why else would I be here, you fool?
56|Dammit.
56|Dammit. Dammit.
56|Why?
56|Why did it come to this?
56|I swear I'll be successful in my next life.
56|I'll be wiser,
56|able to blame bad things on others.
56|I'll be reborn as someone like that.
56|That's why... I'll help you.
56|Take my blood.
56|Take it all.
56|Every last drop.
56|Suck me dry.
56|Thank you.
56|A dream?
56|HAAAH?!
56|H— Hey!
56|Wa— Wake up.
56|Five more minutes.
56|Five minutes
56|I— I told you to wake up already!
56|Don't feel like it.
56|Feel
56|How long you gonna sleep for?!
56|4.6 billion years
56|4.6 billion years or so.
56|Another Earth will form!
56|March 28th
56|It's been two days?
56|Fool!
56|Goodness me.
56|How stupid must thou be
56|to jump under the sunlight?
56|A normal vampire would have evaporated immediately.
56|Never traverse outside whilst the sun is up.
56|Thou art rash but immortal,
56|so thou would burn, regenerate, burn, regenerate
56|in an endless cycle.
56|Such is the woe of being an immortal vampire.
56|Vam... pire?
56|Th— Then are you—
56|'Tis I, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.
56|Call me Heart-Under-Blade.
56|I made my last underling 400 years ago.
56|Thou art my second.
56|Considering thy regenerative prowess...
56|Thou turned out well.
56|U— Underling?
56|Underling
56|Indeed! Thus, thou—
56|That reminds me, I've yet to learn thy name.
56|No matter.
56|The name thou once bore is meaningless hereafter.
56|Anyways, servant.
56|Welcome to the World of the Night.
56|Whe—
56|Where are we?
56|I believe it was called a "cram school."
56|A few years ago, it was closed down and abandoned.
56|Quite the convenient hiding place.
56|Okay, Kiss-Shot. Next question—
56|Halt!
56|I told thee to call me Heart-Under-Blade!
56|That's too long.
56|"Kiss-Shot" is shorter.
56|Or can I not call you that?
56|Nay.
56|Well, if thou prefers, 'tis acceptable.
56|I've no reason to refuse.
56|So?
56|What is thy next question?
56|Um... I became a vampire, right?
56|Obviously.
56|Must I spell it out for thee?
56|Thou became my underling. My servant.
56|Be honored.
56|Your servant...
56|Then, why do you have a child's body now?
56|When we met, you were more... grown-up.
56|Sorry for looking childish!
56|That's not what I meant.
56|Grown-up
56|Plus...
56|Your limbs were severed
56|I drank all of thy blood,
56|yet 'twas still insufficient.
56|Thus, I had to assume this form.
56|Better this than death.
56|That being said, my immortality is minimal
56|and my vampiric powers are greatly limited.
56|Inconvenient indeed.
56|As thou can see,
56|my limbs regenerated at least in shape.
56|Though they are devoid of power...
56|This shall suffice for now.
56|However, do well not to forget thine place, servant.
56|I may appear this way now,
56|but I am a vampire who has lived for 500 years.
56|As but a newborn vampire.
56|thou must never address me as an equal.
56|O— Oh.
56|Such an ambiguous reply.
56|Dost thou truly understand?
56|I think so...
56|Then as a sign of obedience, pat my head.
56|That is enough.
56|Why did you turn me into a vampire?
56|I was prepared to die from being sucked dry by you.
56|No particular reason.
56|Those bitten by vampires will,
56|without exception, become vampires.
56|That is all.
56|Is that so?
56|'Twas quite convenient for me.
56|There is something I need thee to do.
56|Thy blood alone let me regenerate only this far.
56|I am currently far from my full power.
56|Temporarily, thou shall act in my stead.
56|And do what?
56|Can I...
56|Can I... become human again?
56|Hmph. As I thought.
56|I knew that question would come.
56|So? Can I?!
56|Thou can.
56|I guarantee it.
56|I swear on my name.
56|The names of the three who stole Kiss-Shot's body parts
56|Those three specialize in vampire slaying.
56|They're the ones who slayed you?
56|Do not be foolish.
56|They've yet to kill me.
56|However, they stole my limbs.
56|Little regenerative power remains in me.
56|I cannot fight under these conditions. Thus...
56|Thou shall face the three and retrieve my limbs.
56|Huh?
56|"Y— You shall"? As if it's that easy.
56|To make you human again, I must be at full power.
56|In other words, I must be complete.
56|My limbs are absolutely necessary for that.
56|But— But I suck at things like fighting.
56|Worst case scenario, won't I just be slain?
56|Fool.
56|Thou speak as if thou wert still human.
56|Thou art now my underling.
56|Now that I am severely weakened,
56|while I am a top-class vampire, thou could kill me.
56|You mean, despite being a vampire, you're weak?
56|Wrong!
56|Well, I may be stronger than a weakened you.
56|But those three fought the full-powered, complete you
56|and took your limbs.
56|In that case—
56|I grew careless as they ambushed me together.
56|I underestimated them.
56|Which means, as long as thou fights them one-on-one,
56|they do not stand a chance.
56|To be clear, 'tis an easy task.
56|Wh— What should I do?
56|Sever
56|W— Will you people just listen to me?!
56|Sever
56|I— I'm human!
56|Are— Are you going to murder a human?!
56|Rotate
56|Haha!
56|You're all so energetic.
56|Did something good happen?
56|What?
56|Thanks. You saved me.
56|No need for thanks.
56|You saved yourself,
56|Araragi-kun.
56|Naoetsu High School
56|Namishiro Park
56|North Shirahebi Shrine
56|Don't be so on edge.
56|What an intense glare.
56|You seem energetic.
56|Did something good happen?
56|Whatever. Let's go home, Araragi-kun.
56|"Go home"?
56|To the abandoned cram school.
56|Eh?
56|Hold up!
56|H— How do you know about that?
56|Huh?
56|Of course I know.
56|After all, I'm the one who told that girl about it.
56|"Courage is knowing what is right, and doing it."
56|That Heart-Under-Blade girl
56|was struggling to drag your body around,
56|so I showed her a nice place.
56|Who exactly are you?
56|I'm just an old man who's passing by.
56|Relax.
56|I'm no vampire-slaying specialist.
56|My specialty is broader and more extensive.
56|I'll do a proper self-introduction later.
56|Ah!
56|Thou art back!
56|Who is that behind thee?
56|Seems familiar.
56|That's mean.
56|You don't remember me?
56|So?
56|How did it go?
56|How troublesome.
56|Those three are still cooperating.
56|Together, they even beat you at full power.
56|If so, there's no way I can win against them.
56|Like I said, one-on-one—
56|They're together. That's impossible.
56|You said it'd be fine to lay low here,
56|but it won't be long before they find—
56|Don't worry about that.
56|While you two were sleeping,
56|I quietly drew up a boundary.
56|Boundary?
56|Like a barrier?
56|Yup, close enough.
56|What's your aim here?
56|Why are you helping Kiss-Shot and me?
56|I realize you're not our enemy,
56|but I doubt you're our ally.
56|That's not a nice thing to say.
56|I'm here to maintain balance.
56|That is to say, it's my job.
56|Bridging this side and that side.
56|Introduce yourself.
56|You said you would.

56|Haha!
56|Unlike those three, I'm not great at exorcising though.
56|"Not great"?
56|Allow me to rephrase:
56|I don't like it.
56|But aren't you a specialist?
56|I specialize in maintaining balance.
56|I negotiate from neutral ground.
56|You could say that I'm a mediator.
56|Mediate?
56|Bridging this side and that side?
56|Where are "this side" and "that side"?
56|Speech/Voice
56|If "this" is humans, "that" is monsters?
56|Then right now,
56|which side am I on?
56|Monsters?
56|That's nice.
56|I call 'em "oddities."
56|Oddity
56|And she's known as the Oddity Slayer.
56|A rare type of vampire
56|that can drain energy from oddities.
56|That's what makes her so famous.
56|I listened in to your little chat earlier.
56|You seem to be in quite the pickle.
56|I didn't expect things to get so difficult.
56|We've no difficulties.
56|'Tis very simple.
56|Maybe for an undying vampire.
56|But it's difficult for us humans.
56|Right, Araragi-kun?
56|Also, you've piqued my interest, Heart-Under-Blade.
56|You promised to turn Araragi-kun,
56|your servant, back into a human, didn't you?
56|If you'd like, I can mediate.
56|M— Mediate?
56|Like, with those three?
56|Who else?
56|W— Will you help us out?
56|Nope. But I'll lend a hand.
56|The balance feels kinda off at the moment.
56|You're being bullied.
56|Of course, since it's my job, I won't do it for free.
56|Let's see...
56|How 'bout 2 million?
56|2— 2 million?!
56|Akasegawa
56|I won't bother you about when to pay.
56|That's all I ask for in order to maintain balance.
56|But— But...
56|Shall we hear thy specific plan?
56|Negotiating sounds nice, but is not easy.
56|Those three cannot be persuaded.
56|All I can do is bow down and ask nicely.
56|Sincerely.
56|If that doesn't work,
56|I'll resort to more dangerous methods.
56|If they're willing to talk, we can play a game.
56|A game, you say?
56|First, we gotta separate them.
56|Dealing with them one by one should be easy,
56|according to you, isn't that right?
56|Then, let's make it happen.
56|However, brat.
56|How wilt thou negotiate with those three?
56|The details are a trade secret.
56|I'll level the playing field.
56|Next, Araragi will get your limbs back.
56|When you regain your limbs,
56|your power will be restored.
56|Then, Araragi-kun can safely become human again.
56|Hey servant!
56|I lack human currency.
56|I've no concept of how heavy a debt 2 million is.
56|Can I leave thou to shoulder it?
56|Do not fret.
56|This brat's skills are real.
56|I may be weakened, but even I can see that.
56|I don't have much saved...
56|But if I can pay whenever, with no hassle,
56|and I don't need a guarantor or collateral,
56|I'll shoulder it.
56|It's a deal!
56|Thank you, come again.

57|A vampire?
57|He's a vampire?
57|Is it not obvious?
57|Have you ever seen a human that big?
57|In the 500 years I've been on this planet, I've never seen such a human.
57|But why would a vampire specialize in vampire hunting?
57|It makes no sense to me.
57|Kin-slayer vampires are not so uncommon.
57|Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
57|Vampire for a vampire.
57|Is that you, Araragi?
57|Hanekawa?
57|Not a chance.
57|Not showing you today.
57|I've got no idea what you're talking about.
57|Oh, I just have no clue what you're getting at.
57|Did you forget?
57|You saw my panties.
57|Moreover, you couldn't stop staring.
57|It was a misunderstanding! Just a misunderstanding!
57|I only saw the underside of your skirt.
57|That's it. I was focused on the underside of your skirt.
57|That's quite the fetish.
57|What are you doing here, anyway?
57|Just taking a walk.
57|At this hour?
57|What're you reading, Araragi?
57|Baseball tips?
57|What's wrong? Is it the kinda book I shouldn't see?
57|Could it be some adult material?
57|Don't be silly.
57|I've never laid a finger on such vulgar products.
57|Such a thing would stain my soul.
57|Well then, if you'll excuse me.
57|Hold on!
57|Seeing you out here is so random. Why don't we chat a bit longer?
57|Chat?
57|About what?
57|Let's see...
57|Did you learn anything new today?
57|I decided to learn more about math.
57|M-Math, huh?
57|A-Actually, I only brushed up a bit on my Spanish.
57|Spanish?
57|I don't know much of it at all, sadly.
57|That's too bad.
57|I can only speak it on a conversational level.
57|Spasibo!
57|But "spasibo" is Russian...
57|Also, I don't think you're using it in the right context.
57|You should memorize the meaning of words properly.
57|Right.
57|You really know everything.
57|I don't know everything.
57|I just know what I know.
57|Does it really matter what I learned today?
57|Being alive means constantly learning.
57|What a wise thing to say!
57|So let's think about something more constructive,
57|like how to make society better!
57|You're right.
57|How do you think we could get rid of bullying?
57|Hanekawa,
57|shouldn't you head home?
57|I really should myself.
57|I was. No need to state the obvious.
57|You shouldn't be out this late anyway.
57|What if you run into the vampire?
57|I was actually hoping I might.
57|I don't think it's real anyway.
57|But then what happens if I do?
57|Why?
57|Why would you want to meet a vampire?
57|I didn't give it much thought.
57|I guess I'm at an age where such fantasies are common.
57|Meet a vampire and have a little cha—
57|It's not a joke!
57|Huh?
57|Ah, sorry!
57|Did I say something to offend you?
57|No. You offend me.
57|You piss me off.
57|Rub me the wrong way.
57|I'm alone because I want to be.
57|Leave me be.
57|What's gotten into you, Araragi?
57|You were having a good time with me here just a moment ago.
57|It was not fun.
57|I was just pretending that it was.
57|I was after your assets.
57|But my family's not rich at all!
57|I figure you're just trying to look like the good girl to our teachers.
57|You're the top student anyway, so you should leave a failure like me alone!
57|Maybe it just makes you feel superior,
57|but you're so condescending, it kills me!
57|Hanekawa Tsubasa
57|My phone's not your toy either.
57|Huh?
57|Damn it.
57|Huh?

57|Please, go away.
57|Okay.
57|Whatever.
57|One less weakness to deal with.
57|I've gotten stronger.
57|Now...
57|Now I should be able to fight Dramaturgy and complete the task of retrieving Kiss-shot's right leg.
57|That's the most important thing right now.
57|That it breaks my heart is a fleeting discomfort.
57|You gonna do anything, or just try and hide?
57|Aren't you Heart-under-Blade's kin?
57|Stop calling me that.
57|Hey!
57|How do you like that?!
57|Gotcha!
57|Take that!
57|What are you playing at, Dramaturgy?!
57|As you can see, I clearly give up.
57|I see your strength. If you hit me with that, not even someone like me could take it.
57|I'd take two days to regenerate.
57|You don't seem to understand.
57|Most vampires can't regenerate lost limbs that quickly.
57|You're exceptional.
57|You are Heart-under-Blade's kin after all.
57|Even if you are stronger than me with nothing more than brute force,
57|it was my hope that I could win with superior experience.
57|I was wrong.
57|Hunting you down is impossible.
57|But—
57|Or should I put it this way?
57|Never again will I come after you.
57|Just spare my life, please.
57|Naoetsu Private High School Entrance
57|Got the right leg.
57|What just happened here?
57|Tell me, Araragi.
57|I was watching from afar, so I couldn't see very well, but it struck me as a scene from some fantasy novel.
57|It's none of your business.
57|Why were you following me, anyway?
57|You make no sense.
57|I told you to leave me alone.
57|You're just being nosy, going on about being friends.
57|You normally don't say things like that.
57|That means you said it for my sake,
57|because you're in a situation where you don't have any other choice.
57|I'm sorry for not realizing sooner.
57|Sorry!
57|I just want to help you!
57|How can you be so damn pushy?
57|You're reading too much into it.
57|I was just bored being around you.
57|I like being by myself.
57|You're being dishonest.
57|There are antisocial people, and people who turn their backs on society.
57|You're not one of them.
57|That much is obvious.
57|When you were talking with me, you seemed to be enjoying yourself at least.
57|But I was just after your assets!
57|But my family's not rich, so that makes no sense!
57|Then I was after your Bud!
57|But we're not old enough for beer yet!
57|But I meant I was after your bod!
57|But is it my bod or my Bud then?!
57|Your bod!
57|If you show me your panties again, perhaps I'll reconsider.
57|Fine.
57|Like this?
57|Can you see all right?
57|Should I take off my blouse too?
57|Or—
57|I'm sorry for being so cruel.
57|Would you become my friend?
57|You really got it back.
57|That's what I'm here for.
57|Here, Heart-under-Blade.
57|What are you gonna do with it, though?
57|It's too big for you now.
57|Are you gonna just replace your current leg?
57|Actually, it's more like this.
57|Stop staring, you fools.
57|Leave me alone while I eat.
57|Get some manners!
57|By the way, Oshino.
57|What is it?
57|Dramaturgy blew off my left arm,
57|but it grew back immediately.
57|Why didn't Kiss-shot's limbs grow back too?
57|Maybe Heart-under-Blade lost most of her power by the time you got to her.
57|I thought so too,
57|but when he cut off my arms,
57|as they grew back, the ones he cut off dissolved.
57|I was worried Kiss-shot's limbs had dissolved as well.
57|But they hadn't.
57|So I was wondering why they didn't regenerate or dissolve.
57|She's a rare specimen.
57|They wanted to take her body parts and use them as their own.
57|Take her body parts without damaging them.
57|It wasn't really her limbs that they were after, but her powers as a vampire.
57|Can I really return to being human, Oshino?
57|Once you get back Heart-under-Blade's limbs, I figure.
57|She said so, didn't she?
57|But what if she lied?
57|What if she just wants her limbs back?
57|Now.
57|You shouldn't doubt her like that.
57|That's mean.
57|But—
57|You owe her your life.
57|Learn some gratitude.
57|Why are you making that face, Araragi?
57|Think of something nice?
57|Don't talk like you know me.
57|In the end, maybe it's my fault.
57|What?
57|That you ran into a vampire.
57|They say if you speak of the devil, he'll appear.
57|It works in ghost stories all the time.
57|Speaking of oddities draws them in from the other side.
57|I doubt that's how it works.
57|You're the one who talked to me about it, so shouldn't you be running into one?
57|I don't think it's that specific.
57|There's just a higher chance.
57|And in the end I did get to see one.
57|Right, Araragi?
57|Speaking of which, weren't you actively looking for a vampire last night?
57|Why would you do that?
57|You wanted to talk with a higher lifeform that badly?
57|I wasn't that serious about it.
57|I was just shooting for the moon.
57|How should I put it?
57|I was kinda lost.
57|I wanted some spice in my life.
57|Spice, huh?
57|Escapism, ultimately.
57|And I want to return to reality.
57|You can, I'm sure.
57|While I said I wanted to help you,
57|at this point, I doubt there's much I can actually do for you.
57|I dunno about that.
57|I'm grateful you brought me clothes and stuff.
57|Don't mention it.
57|Shouldn't you change already?
57|Your clothes are a mess.
57|You're right.
57|Um...
57|Oh well.
57|Guess I can put on another shirt.
57|It was a size M, right?
57|Yeah.
57|I brought both trunks and briefs.
57|What's wrong?
57|Weren't you going to change?
57|Right.
57|Hold on.
57|I noticed yesterday.
57|Your physique's changed, don't you think?
57|When I saw you from the back, your silhouette was like someone else.
57|Your muscles changed.
57|You're more slim, or rather more toned.
57|Turning into a vampire changes your body.
57|Your regeneration tries to keep your body in the healthiest state.
57|Excuse me.
57|To the touch you're just like a human,
57|but you feel more dynamic.
57|Just like a human?
57|Have you touched other men before, Hanekawa?
57|I—N-No—Of course not!
57|I was speaking from how I imagined it would be.
57|That's not right.
57|You should put on a shirt.
57|Right.
57|Guess I got the right size.
57|Thanks, Hanekawa.
57|I owe you one for this.
57|That's about all I can do for you.
57|About all, huh? It's more than enough.
57|Thanks a lot.
57|Stop that!
57|We should always help each other in times of need!
57|If there's anything I can do for you, just say it.
57|At this point, I can't really do more than this, though.
57|Oh right! How about cleaning this classroom?
57|It's such a mess.
57|It's fine. It's been like this since I've been here.
57|That doesn't mean it's okay to leave it like this.
57|You should sort things out when you can.
57|Oh? What's this?
57|Oh, I forgot.
57|You seemed to treasure that picture book a lot, so I brought it when we came here.
57|Why would you?!
57|You ran into her on your way home from the bookstore?
57|Back on the 25th?
57|The day we saw each other?
57|What might this be?
57|Episode is a vampire hunter, and also a half vampire.
57|I've picked up enough vampire vocab to understand that,
57|but I'd appreciate some more information.
57|I forgot.
57|What?!
57|Wait a moment. I'll remember.
57|I remembered.
57|What?
57|Episode hates vampires.
57|He does?
57|Why?
57|Isn't he half a vampire himself?
57|Simply put, it's because half vampires don't belong in the world of vampires.
57|Naturally, they aren't exactly accepted among humans either.
57|That's why they despise their own vampire blood.
57|But even then, Episode seems to have an exceptionally strong hatred for vampires.
57|For Dramaturgy, it was just a job.
57|For Episode, it's a personal vendetta.
57|This shit's hilarious.
57|I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
57|Old Dramaturgy got his ass handed to him by a little piece of shit like you.
57|There won't be a trace of you left.
57|You better not be thinking I'll be nice and hold back for you.
57|I hate picking on weaklings,
57|but I love bullying the bad guys.
57|Am I the bad guy here, then?
57|For sure.
57|A fucking monster.
57|As are you.
57|What's that, you say?
57|Say it loud and clear if you've got something on your mind!
57|Nah.
57|I got nothing.
57|Let's get this over with.
57|A cross?!
57|Araragi!
57|Don't give up just yet!
57|He's mist!
57|He's mist, so—
57|Hanekawa.
57|Hanekawa!
57|Shut up, Araragi.
57|Relax.
57|He's just mist.
57|What a fuckin' joke.
57|Mist. Water.
57|What happens if I blow dirt on it?
57|That's enough.
57|Go any further and you'll cease to be human.
57|Oshino... You... Hanekawa...
57|Don't be so loud.
57|You seem so worked up.
57|Did something nice happen to you?
57|Sorry to ruin your fun, but the fight's over.
57|He's knocked out.
57|But... But...
57|Hanekawa...
57|Hanekawa!
57|I saw.
57|You were watching?
57|Why didn't you stop it?!
57|That's not my job.
57|I'm only paid to negotiate with the three vampire hunters.
57|Anything more requires additional payment.
57|I don't get involved with bystanders.
57|Then say so in the first place!
57|Say so...
57|Are you gonna pay, say, two million more for her?
57|Two million? Even three!
57|Not an appropriate time for silliness.
57|Not silliness, business.
57|Three million and you've got a deal.
57|I'll give you a hint.
57|Try using your head a little.
57|What do you have that immortal body for?
57|Hanekawa...
57|Araragi?
57|What are you doing on top of me?
57|Did you rip my uniform?
57|Sorry.
57|Just give me a moment more.
57|My body's gotten much better.
57|I think I've regained most of my immortality.
57|You could even handle the next fight yourself.
57|Alas, I'm still far from being able to use my vampire skills.
57|It'd just take a bit more to kill me.
57|I could maybe fight Dramaturgy, but definitely not Episode.
57|Especially not Guillotine Cutter.
57|Guillotine Cutter.
57|He's human, right?
57|Not a vampire like Dramaturgy or a half-blood like Episode.
57|He's completely, entirely just a human.
57|"Just" a human?
57|Good point.
57|He's a priest.
57|Some Vatican specialist?
57|Close, yet so far.
57|But if he's just a human, how could he stand against a vampire?
57|Not a vampire or a half-blood, just a normal human and a professional.
57|That alone is quite worrying.
57|He took both my arms.
57|I must admit I was careless, though.
57|I wasn't in my best shape either.
57|For Dramaturgy, hunting vampires is just a job. For Episode, it's out of spite.
57|But Guillotine Cutter considers it his destiny.
57|Might sound strange coming from me, but a man's faith is quite a pain.
57|Hanekawa. Has your wound healed?
57|There's no sign of it at all.
57|Good.
57|Let me see it.
57|Oh, please.
57|Want a sandwich?
57|These have tomato in them.
57|I'll pass.
57|Your call.
57|Here, have a Coke.
57|Thanks.
57|And a diet one for me.
57|You don't even have to work out to get muscles.
57|I bet you can't get fat either, no matter how much you eat.
57|Being a girl, I'm pretty jealous.
57|Dunno how that works.
57|I don't really get hungry at all.
57|I feel like I don't need to eat.
57|Don't vampires feed on blood?
57|Now that you mention it.
57|Do you feel like you want to drink blood then?
57|I haven't noticed.
57|Hanekawa.
57|You should stop coming here.
57|I figured you'd say that.
57|Don't feel hurt, please.
57|It's not like the other day.
57|Sure, I was doing it because I didn't want you to get involved,
57|but even more than that, I just couldn't control myself.
57|I was venting at you. I regret it.
57|But not now. This is different.
57|How so?
57|I lost it yesterday when Episode's cross tore a hole in you.
57|My blood started boiling,
57|and I thought it was all over.
57|For me?
57|For me.
57|We talked about power levels earlier, right?
57|When you got hurt, it felt like I was the one bleeding.
57|Hurt even more, actually.
57|I don't want to regain my humanity if it means sacrificing you.
57|Sacrifice?
57|I don't really look at it that way at all.
57|But don't you think it's crazy?
57|I ruined your spring vacation.
57|You almost died, even.
57|Is that not crazy to you?
57|Not at all.
57|I just don't get it.
57|I'm not sure I could go this far if I were in your place.
57|It's so dangerous.
57|And you're not even immortal.
57|I don't think I could stand up like that.
57|But you can.
57|That scares me.
57|Creeps me out.
57|Please don't be upset.
57|I didn't mean it that way.
57|I just don't get why you'd go so far for me.
57|We're schoolmates who just talked for the first time a few days ago.
57|I don't get how can you be so devoted.
57|It's like you're a saint.
57|Your sacrifice is too much for me to shoulder.
57|I don't have a solid enough character for that.
57|It's not sacrifice.
57|Then what is it?
57|Self-satisfaction.
57|You misunderstand.
57|I'm not a particularly good or strong person.
57|I just do whatever pleases me.
57|I think I'm the most selfish person out there.
57|I'm cunning and stubborn too.
57|That part should actually creep you out.
57|But all that makes no sense if I just keep getting in your way.
57|I've done enough shopping for you too.
57|Not much else I could do for you.
57|There is something.
57|Wait for me, when the term starts, at school.
57|Wait for me.
57|I'm honestly looking forward to chatting with you again.
57|Oops.
57|Beep beep.
57|What's that?
57|You almost struck my heart.
57|What, there's a sound effect for that?
57|Man, that was really close.
57|I almost fell for you.
57|Fell?
57|You mean like animal fur?
57|Is that how you pick up girls?
57|Give me a break.
57|I don't even talk to girls.
57|Playing innocent?
57|Don't forget, I saw your magazine.
57|Jeez.
57|Here.
57|You can have it for now.
57|Give it back when the term starts.
57|You've got a thing for panties, right?
57|Uh...
57|Well, if you don't want it—
57|I never said I don't want it!
57|That's not the issue at hand, right?
57|I should return it when the new term starts, right?
57|Sorry, I might not be able to return it.
57|What?
57|Or rather, no way in hell I'm letting go of it.
57|It shall be passed down in the Araragi family as a treasured heirloom.
57|Spare me.
57|These panties have parted with your body forever!
57|That's not fair!
57|I won't return your panties,
57|but I'll be sure to repay my debt.
57|If a time comes when you need me,
57|even if I can't do anything for you, I'll be sure to be there.
57|From this day forward,
57|repaying my debt to you is my reason to live.
57|Just give back my panties.
57|And now I have to get home without anything on, with a skirt that's so prone to flipping!
57|Beating that Guillotine Cutter guy is nothing in comparison!
57|You're right!
57|Best of luck!
57|You too!
57|See you next term!
57|Sorry. I screwed up.
57|He got her.
57|What am I supposed to do?
57|What am I even supposed to do now?
57|Araragi, give up your humanity.
57|Araragi, I'm sorry. I...
57|What do you want with her?
57|Nothing, if you don't move.
57|I possess no powers like you, but I'm quite well trained.
57|Killing one girl isn't an issue.
57|And you call yourself human?
57|Hanekawa.
57|Don't worry.
57|I'll save you.
57|So ominous.
57|I'm not so kind as to see your high school friendship unfold.
57|Should we begin?
57|Begin what?
57|The moment the fight begins, you raise your hands and say, "I give up."
57|That is, the fight would be over the moment it starts.
57|Fine.
57|Araragi, don't worry about me!
57|How could I not worry?!
57|Run! Run!
57|If I can't see you anymore, there'd be no point in being human again!
57|Araragi.
57|I'm really not human anymore.
57|I gave up my humanity.
57|I understand that.
57|I'm a monster.

58|Dramaturgy is a vampire.
58|Va— Vampire?
58|He's a vampire?
58|Just look at him.
58|Are there humans of his stature?
58|Flashback
58|In my five hundred years of life,
58|I've never known a human like that.
58|Then,
58|why is a vampire specializing in vampire slaying?
58|I don't get it.
58|A vampire that kills its brethren
58|is not that unusual.
58|"An eye for an eye,
58|a tooth for a tooth..."
58|And a vampire for a vampire, right?
58|Is that you, Araragi-kun?
58|Hanekawa...
58|Nope.
58|You can't see them today.
58|Rotate
58|What—
58|What are—
58|What are you talking about?
58|I don't—
58|understand.
58|—stand.
58|Sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
58|Um, what?
58|Did you forget?
58|You saw my panties.
58|You got a real good look at them.
58|I SAW THEM
58|N— No!
58|This is a huge misunderstanding!
58|I was only looking at the shape of your skirt...
58|Y— Yeah...
58|I was only paying attention to the shape...
58|That's still pretty perverted.
58|Hanekawa,
58|what are you doing out here?
58|Hm?
58|Taking a stroll?
58|Wait...
58|At this hour?
58|Whatcha reading, Araragi-kun?
58|A baseball book?
58|What's wrong?
58|Can't show me your book?
58|Ah, is it actually porn?
58|Nonsense!
58|I've never even touched such filthy publications.
58|They would taint your soul.
58|Well, later.
58|I'm out.
58|Oh?
58|Wait, I live pretty far away!
58|Let's talk some more!
58|Talk?
58|About what?
58|Huh? Good question.
58|So Araragi-kun,
58|what did you study today?
58|I tried to focus on math.
58|Ma—
58|Math, huh?
58|U— Unfortunately, I only studied Spanish today.
58|Spanish?
58|Darn, I don't know that much Spanish.
58|Wh— What a shame.
58|Yeah,
58|I'm at a conversational level.
58|Spasibo!
58|Spasibo is Russian though.
58|Also, spasibo doesn't mean "wonderful."
58|That's not good.
58|You memorized the wrong definition.
58|R— Right.
58|You really do know everything.
58|I don't know everything.
58|I just know what I know.
58|Anyways,
58|isn't learning in general a good thing?
58|People are learning their whole lives.
58|Great quote, Araragi-kun!
58|So we need to be more constructive...
58|Yeah!
58|By thinking of ways to improve society!
58|That's true.
58|How do we prevent bullying?
58|Hanekawa,
58|shall we go home soon?
58|I should be heading back.
58|Hm?
58|Well, I was going to leave soon anyway...
58|Don't come out at night.
58|You might encounter a vampire.
58|Actually, I was kinda hoping for that.
58|I do think it's just a rumor,
58|but anything's possible...
58|Why?
58|Why do you want to meet a vampire?
58|I haven't thought that far ahead.
58|I'm just hoping for something extraordinary.
58|Meeting a vampire,
58|having a little chat—
58|Shut the fuck up!
58|What?
58|S— Sorry!
58|Did something I say irritate you?
58|No, you irritate me.
58|You piss me off
58|and make me sick.
58|I like being alone, so
58|stop following me.
58|A— Araragi-kun, what's going on?
58|Weren't you just having fun talking to me?
58|No, I wasn't.
58|I was pretending to have fun.
58|I'm just after your money!
58|My— My family isn't that rich!
58|Kishi Gymnasium
58|You're probably just here to make yourself look better,
58|'cause a genius like you would never
58|give a damn about a failure like me!
58|You must feel so superior, so good about yourself,
58|but no one asked for your sympathy!
58|Hanekawa Tsubasa
58|Don't touch people's phones without permission!
58|Huh?
58|Shit.
58|Huh? Huh?
58|Delete 1 entry?
58|Deleting
58|Deleted
58|Get out of my face.
58|Got it.
58|It's okay.
58|With this, I've regained
58|a bit of my humanity.
58|I've gotten stronger.
58|That's why...
58|That's why
58|fighting Dramaturgy
58|and retrieving Kiss-Shot's right leg
58|shouldn't be a problem.
58|For now, that's my priority.
58|A broken heart is no big deal.
58|March 31st
58|Naoetsu Private High School Entrance
58|What's wrong?
58|Merely running away, Heart-Under-Blade's underling?
58|Don't refer to me like that.
58|Take that!
58|Try this
58|What are you doing, Dramaturgy?!
58|Exactly what it seems. I surrender.
58|I cannot afford to be struck by that at your strength.
58|It would take me two days to recover.
58|You don't understand.
58|Not all vampires can instantly regenerate.
58|You are an exception.
58|You are Heart-Under-Blade's servant, after all.
58|Even if I lost in terms of potential,
58|I thought I could win with experience. However...
58|I stood no chance.
58|I cannot hunt you.
58|But still...
58|Would you be satisfied if I said this?
58|I will never lay another hand on you.
58|Please spare my life.
58|Naoetsu Private High School Entrance
58|For now...
58|Right leg obtained.
58|What was that?
58|Hey, Araragi-kun.
58|I'm not sure 'cause I was far away,
58|but weren't you doing things out of a light novel?
58|This doesn't concern you.
58|Or rather,
58|why are you stalking me?
58|I don't get it.
58|Didn't I tell you not to follow me?
58|Stop acting like you're my friend.
58|You're not the type of person to say these things.
58|I think it's my fault for making you saying that.
58|You're in a situation that forces you
58|to act that way, right?
58|Sorry for not noticing sooner.
58|I'm sorry!
58|If that's the case, I want to help!
58|You're so pushy!
58|You're overthinking it.
58|I simply got bored of you.
58|I like being alone.
58|Lies.
58|Someone who hates people or the world itself...
58|That's not who you are.
58|I know that much!
58|Because you at least seemed to enjoy talking with me!
58|Like I said (Dakara), I was just after your money!
58|da
58|ka
58|ra
58|Like I said (Dakara), my family isn't that rich!
58|da
58|ka
58|ra
58|Then I'm after your Dakara!
58|Dakara is a brand of bottled water in Japan.
58|If you're thirsty, just say so!
58|Whoops, bit my tongue
58|No, I meant your body (karada)!
58|da
58|ka
58|ra
58|ka
58|ra
58|da
58|Which do you want, my Dakara or my body?!
58|Your body!!
58|If you want, show me your panties one more time
58|and we can make up.
58|Got it.
58|Is this okay?
58|Can you see them?
58|If you want, I can take my blouse off too.
58|Hey—
58|Sorry for all horrible things I said!
58|Please be my friend.
58|He really gave it back, huh?
58|That's what mediators are for.
58|Here, Heart-Under-Blade.
58|What are you gonna do?
58|It's much bigger than your current leg.
58|You can't just swap them, can you?
58|I'm doing this.
58|Do not watch me, barbarians!
58|Let me eat in peace!
58|Show some manners.
58|By the way, Oshino...
58|Hm? What's up?
58|Flashback
58|When my left arm was blown off by Dramaturgy,
58|it quickly grew back.
58|Then why haven't Kiss-Shot's limbs regenerated?
58|Flashback
58|That's because Heart-Under-Blade's vampiric immortality
58|was almost gone by the time you two met.
58|Don't you agree?
58|That's what I thought, but—
58|But...
58|Flashback
58|After my arms were cut off, they regenerated,
58|and the severed ones vanished.
58|So, Kiss-Shot's limbs should've vanished as well.
58|Yet they haven't.
58|Why is that?
58|They've neither regenerated nor vanished...
58|That girl's a special case, Araragi-kun.
58|Those guys stole her limbs
58|as if they were property.
58|Her limbs are severed but still intact, right?
58|Meaning, what they stole wasn't only her limbs,
58|but also her vampiric existence itself.
58|Oshino.
58|Can I really become human again?
58|Well, if you obtain all of Heart-Under-Blade's limbs,
58|then you can.
58|Isn't that what she said?
58|Yeah, but
58|what if she was lying?
58|In order to regain her limbs, she lied—
58|Hey.
58|You shouldn't say stuff like that.
58|It's pathetic.
58|But—
58|Being so rude to someone who saved your life
58|makes you quite the ingrate.
58|Hey, hey. Why the long face, Araragi-kun?
58|Did something good happen?
58|Don't talk like you can see through me.
58|April 1st
58|It's probably my fault.
58|Huh, what is?
58|That you met a vampire.
58|"Speak of the devil and he shall appear," right?
58|I guess that also applies to the supernatural.
58|Speak of them, and they'll appear before you.
58|That's weird then.
58|Since you were the one who told me the rumor,
58|a vampire should've appeared for you.
58|I didn't say one has to.
58|I just meant the possibility increases.
58|Besides, in a way, one did appear before me:
58|Araragi-kun.
58|Rumors and possibility aside,
58|you were searching for a vampire yesterday.
58|Why were you doing that?
58|You wanted to meet a "superhuman being"
58|and chat with it or something?
58|It's not like I was seriously searching.
58|That'd be asking for the impossible.
58|I don't know how to put this,
58|but I felt like I had hit a dead end.
58|Like, I wanted my life to change.
58|Change, huh?
58|In the end, that's just escaping from reality.
58|I wanna return to reality.
58|You will, I'm sure.
58|Though I said I wanted to help you,
58|if we're dealing with what we talked about,
58|then there's not much I can do.
58|That's not true.
58|Even if it's just bringing living supplies and what not,
58|I'm still grateful.
58|No problem, it's the least I could do.
58|Anyways, you need to change.
58|Your clothes are all torn.
58|Right.
58|Uh...
58|W— Well, um...
58|I'll just change the top for now.
58|Medium should fit, right?
58|Y— Yeah!
58|I didn't know if you wanted briefs or boxers, so I got both.
58|What's wrong?
58|Not gonna change?
58|I will...
58|Hold on!
58|I was right.
58|I noticed yesterday too.
58|Araragi-kun, your physique has changed.
58|You looked like a different person from behind yesterday.
58|Your muscles are more defined.
58|They've gotten leaner, or rather, firmer.
58|Becoming a vampire restructures your body.
58|Your regenerative power keeps you at peak condition.
58|Pardon me.
58|You don't feel different than other humans.
58|Although, there's more elasticity to your body.
58|"Other humans"?
58|Hanekawa, you've touched the bodies
58|of other men?
58|No, no!
58|Never in my life!
58|Th— That's right.
58|It was all just baseless conjecture.
58|Yeah, my bad.
58|Hurry up and put on a shirt.
58|O— Oh!
58|Looks good.
58|You're a lifesaver, Hanekawa.
58|I definitely owe you one.
58|Don't worry, this was the most I could do.
58|This is more than enough.
58|Thank you very much.
58|Do— Don't worry about it!
58|Friends should help each other out in times of need!
58|If there's anything else you want me to do,
58|don't hesitate to ask.
58|That is the best I can do for now, though.
58|Oh right! Why don't we clean this room up?
58|It's a total mess!
58|It's fine, this is normal.
58|We still shouldn't leave things lying around.
58|Any place that can be cleaned, should be cleaned.
58|Huh?
58|What?
58|What's this?
58|Flashback
58|I forgot to mention,
58|that bag you dropped looked important,
58|so after we came, I went back to retrieve it.
58|Y— You fucking traitor!
58|Um...
58|So you encountered a vampire
58|as you returned from the bookstore
58|on March 25th?
58|The night you ran into me?
58|So, what's this?

58|April 4th
58|Episode is a half-vampire vampire hunter.
58|Flashback Complete
58|Well, I know what that means,
58|but can't you give me more details?
58|I forgot.
58|Y— You—
58|Patience. I shall remember forthwith.
58|I remembered.
58|What did you remember?
58|Episode despises vampires with a passion.
58|Despises?
58|How come?
58|Isn't he half-vampire?
58|Well, simply put,
58|half-vampires are not an entity accepted in the vampire world.
58|They are not accepted in the human world either.
58|Thus, he hates his vampire blood.
58|Above all, Episode bears a strong hatred towards vampires.
58|Unlike Dramaturgy, who was just doing his job,
58|he's driven by self-interest.
58|That's hilarious!
58|I'm laughing for real!
58|Chief Dramaturgy got wrecked by a brat like you?
58|Well, there won't be anything left once I'm done with you.
58|I'll say this now:
58|Don't think I'll go easy on you.
58|I hate picking on weaklings,
58|but I love picking on bad guys!
58|Am I a bad guy?
58|Of course!
58|You're a monster, after all.
58|Monster
58|You're the...
58|Huh?
58|I'm the what?
58|If you wanna say something, spit it out!
58|No, never mind.
58|I have nothing to say.
58|Let's do this!
58|The c— cross?
58|Araragi-kun!
58|You can't give up yet!
58|Your opponent turns into fog!
58|Fog, which means—
58|Hanekawa...
58|Hanekawa! Hanekawa! Hanekawa!!
58|Araragi-kun, be quiet...
58|Get it together...
58|Your opponent turns into fog...
58|Hilarious.
58|Fog. In other words, water.
58|What would happen if I scatter the sand?
58|That's enough!
58|Any further and you'll lose your humanity.
58|O— Oshi— O—
58|You— You were—
58|What about Hanekawa?!
58|Don't yell.
58|You sure are energetic today.
58|Did something good happen?
58|However,
58|even if you still have energy,
58|this match is over.
58|Look, he fainted.
58|But— But—
58|Hanekawa was...
58|Hanekawa was...!
58|Yes, I was watching.
58|Why did you just watch then?
58|Why didn't you stop her?!
58|Not part of the fee.
58|I'm only here to negotiate with the three vampire slayers.
58|Anything else costs extra.
58|I'm not concerned with ordinary people.
58|Then tell me from the beginning!
58|If you told me...
58|The fee for Class Rep-chan...
58|How's another 2 million yen sound?
58|2 million?
58|I'd even pay 3 million!
58|This isn't time for jokes, Oshino!
58|It's not a joke (joudan), it's a deal (shoudan), Araragi-kun.
58|jou
58|dan
58|shou
58|dan
58|At 3 million yen, we have a deal.
58|I'll give you a hint:
58|Use your head, Araragi-kun.
58|What can you use your immortal body for?
58|Hanekawa...
58|Araragi-kun?
58|Why are you rubbing my stomach like it's precious?
58|Also, my uniform's been ripped up.
58|Does this mean you're...
58|Sorry, Hanekawa.
58|Let me stay like this a little longer.
58|April 5th
58|My body feels a lot better now!
58|Power has been restored throughout my body.
58|I see. Then can you fight the next battle?
58|Nay. Unfortunately, I still cannot utilize
58|some of my vampire skills.
58|I'm merely harder to kill than before.
58|I may be able to handle Dramaturgy
58|but not Episode in this state.
58|And if the opponent were Guillotine Cutter...
58|Guillotine Cutter, eh?
58|Flashback
58|He's a human, isn't he?
58|Correct. He is not a vampire like Dramaturgy
58|nor a half-vampire like Episode.
58|He is, for all intents and purposes, a mere human.
58|I don't think he's a mere human though.
58|Hm, indeed.
58|That man is a priest.
58|Don't tell me he's part of the Christian Special Forces.
58|Close but not quite.
58|Whatever he is, isn't he only human?
58|No matter what tricks he uses, isn't he no match for a vampire?
58|While he is a human, not a vampire nor a half-vampire,
58|he specializes in vampire slaying.
58|Thou should not take him lightly.
58|In fact, I had both my arms stolen by him.
58|Although, I was careless back then.
58|My physical condition was also poor.
58|If Dramaturgy hunts for work,
58|and Episode hunts out of self-interest,
58|then Guillotine Cutter hunts vampires out of faith.
58|In my opinion, this thing called "religion" is nothing but trouble.
58|Hanekawa, how's your stomach wound?
58|You call it a wound,
58|but there's no scar left.
58|Really?
58|I wonder...
58|Lemme see.
58|What do you mean "I wonder"?
58|Hey Araragi-kun, want a sandwich?
58|This one has tomatoes.
58|Oh.
58|Nah, I'm good.
58|Sure?
58|Here, Araragi-kun.
58|Coca Cola.
58|Oh, thank you.
58|And for me, a Diet Coke.
58|Oh?
58|Now that you're naturally muscular,
58|you won't get fat no matter how many calories you consume.
58|As a girl, I'm pretty jealous.
58|I dunno...
58|It's more like I just don't have an appetite anymore.
58|Like I could go without eating.
58|Wouldn't "eating" for vampires mean "sucking blood"?
58|Ah, right.
58|On that note, do you ever get the urge to suck blood?
58|Hm?
58|Now that you mention it, I don't.
58|Hanekawa.
58|You shouldn't come here anymore.
58|Well, I saw this coming.
58|Please. Don't put yourself in danger.
58|Lately, things have changed.
58|The other night,
58|I didn't want you to get involved in all of this.
58|To be honest, my emotions got the better of me.
58|I vented my anger out on you, and I regret that.
58|But this time, it's different.
58|How so?
58|Yesterday, when Episode's cross gouged out your side,
58|I lost my mind.
58|Blood rushed to my head.
58|I thought someone was gonna die.
58|Me?
58|Me.
58|We once talked about "humanity."
58|When you were wounded, I felt like I was too.
58|No,
58|it hurt more than if I had been wounded.
58|Hanekawa, I—
58|Don't want to become human if it means neglecting you.
58|Neglecting me?
58|I have no intention of letting that happen!
58|Are you even thinking about what you're doing?
58|Your precious spring break
58|is being wasted on me.
58|What's worse, you almost died!
58|Did you forget what happened?!
58|Not— Not at all!
58|I don't understand.
58|Flashback
58|For example, if we were to switch places,
58|I wouldn't be able to do the things you do.
58|I wouldn't have the confidence
58|to confront a dangerous man
58|with a body that isn't immortal.
58|But you do it like it's normal!
58|You... scare me.
58|Frankly, I'm repelled.
58|Don't feel bad!
58|I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
58|But why would you go so far for me?
58|I just don't understand!
58|I'm some classmate you just met,
58|yet, for whatever reason, you're so devoted to me.
58|You're like a saint.
58|But your self-sacrifice is too much for me.
58|It's more than I could hope to bear.
58|It's not self-sacrifice.
58|It's not self-sacrifice at all!
58|Then what is it?
58|Self-satisfaction.
58|Araragi-kun, you have the wrong impression of me!
58|I'm not that good or strong of a person!
58|I only do the things I want to do!
58|I don't think there's anyone more selfish than me!
58|I'm deceitful and very stubborn.
58|At least, enough to repel you.
58|However,
58|if my presence only makes things harder for you,
58|then I must have my priorities mixed up.
58|Time to retire as your shopping assistant.
58|Looks like there's nothing left for me to do.
58|No, there is something you can do.
58|Wait for me.
58|Next semester, in that school,
58|please wait for me.
58|I'll look forward to talking with you again
58|from the bottom of my heart.
58|Woah there!
58|Pipipi. Pipipi. Pipipi.
58|What's that sound?
58|Heartbeats.
58|That's the sound of a girl's heartbeat?!
58|That was dangerous.
58|I almost fell in love.
58|So deeply that you'd have struck water or oil?
58|Do you always hit on girls like that?
58|I don't know what you're talking about.
58|I almost never talk to girls in the first place.
58|Says the guy who buys dirty magazines.
58|Special Issue:
58|Bespectacled
58|Class
58|Reps
58|Geez...
58|Um...
58|I'll lend you these.
58|Give them back when we meet next semester.
58|Araragi-kun, you like panties, don't you?
58|Uh...
58|Ah, if you don't want them...
58|No! No! No!
58|I never said I don't!
58|It's not a matter of whether or not I want them!
58|What did you say?!
58|I can give 'em back next semester?!
58|Wow~Wow~Wow
58|Sorry,
58|I can't give 'em back.
58|H— Huh?
58|Actually, I'll never give 'em back.
58|They'll be passed down as an Araragi family heirloom.
58|Please stop.
58|These panties have parted with your body for eternity!
58|What the hell?!
58|I won't give them back.
58|In exchange,
58|I'll definitely repay this debt.
58|Whenever you need me,
58|even if there's nothing I can do,
58|I'll definitely be by your side.
58|Starting today, repaying this debt
58|will be my life's purpose.
58|Just gimme back my panties!
58|I'm currently going commando
58|with nothing but a thin skirt on,
58|and I have to walk all the way home!
58|Araragi-kun, compared to this,
58|your final battle with Guillotine Cutter
58|should be a piece of cake, right?!
58|Of course!
58|Then, good luck!
58|Good luck!
58|See you next semester!
58|Sorry, I fucked up.
58|Class Rep-chan got kidnapped.
58|What should I do?
58|What the hell should I—
58|Araragi-kun,
58|give up on being human.
58|Araragi-kun!
58|S— Sorry, Araragi-kun, I—
58|What are you planning to do with Hanekawa?
58|Nothing at all,
58|as long as you don't do anything.
58|I don't have superpowers like you lot.
58|Even so, I've been well-trained.
58|I can easily kill one little girl.
58|And you call yourself human?
58|Hanekawa.
58|It's alright.
58|I'll definitely save you.
58|Tsk. How unsightly.
58|I don't have the patience to humor your juvenile chitchat.
58|Shall we begin?
58|Begin what, exactly?
58|The instant the fight begins,
58|you shall raise both hands and say "I surrender."
58|In other words, the fight ends as soon as it begins.
58|Got it.
58|Araragi-kun!
58|Don't worry about me!
58|There's no way I could ever do that!
58|If I can't see you again,
58|then there's no point in being human!
58|Araragi-kun,
58|Give up on being human
58|This is clearly
58|inhuman.
58|I've thrown away my humanity,
58|I know.
58|Because I'm nothing more than a monster.

58|Preview
58|I was always bored.
58|However, thou never bored me, servant.
58|I am leaving. My job is done.
58|Though it ended in failure.
58|Didn't I tell you?
58|If you knew the real me, you'd be disillusioned.
58|It's my fault... It's my fault... It's my fault!
58|Thou did not save me because I was special.
58|Thou would have saved anyone who looked weak.
58|Die, my master!
58|Die, my servant!
58|Kizumonogatari
58|Reiketsu-hen
58|A— Araragi-kun,
58|p— please fondle my braless boobs.
58|Subbed by EdoPhantom
59|Well then, let us begin.
59|O pitiful boy.
59|Ye kin of Heart-Under-Blade!
59|Wait.
59|Before that, let me confirm one thing.
59|If I win,
59|you'll return Kiss-shot's right leg.
59|Agreeable?
59|On the condition that if I am victorious
59|you shall tell me the whereabouts of Heart-Under-Blade.
59|Agreed.
59|Then let's get to it.
59|Dramaturgy is a vampire.
59|A vampire?
59|That dude's a vampire?
59|It should be evident at a glance.
59|Or is such a physique common amongst humans?
59|I have lived for 500 years,
59|yet I have beheld no such specimen.
59|But...
59|Why would a vampire specialise in vampire hunting?
59|It doesn't make any sense.
59|A vampire who kills its own kind
59|is not as uncommon as you might think.
59|An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.
59|And a vampire for a vampire.
59|Is that an Araragi I spy?
59|Hanekawa!
59|Hmm?
59|Too bad. I won't let you sneak a peek today!
59|What in the world
59|could you possibly be referring to?
59|Unfortunate as it may be,
59|I haven't the faintest idea.
59|Eh? Did you go and forget?
59|That's bold considering you were ogling my panties.
59|And I mean you really had yourself a stare.
59|Perish the thought!
59|You're gravely mistaken!
59|I was only admiring the inner lining of your skirt.
59|That's right. I was engrossed solely by the inner lining of your skirt.
59|That's pretty perverted in its own special way.
59|Hanekawa.
59|What are you doing in a place like this?
59|Taking a walk, I suppose?
59|A walk?
59|At this hour?
59|Whatcha looking at, Araragi?
59|A book on baseball?
59|What's the matter? Is it the kind of book you can't show others?
59|Ah!
59|Is it an unsavory kind of book?
59|Such foolishness!
59|I have never even laid a finger on such vulgar literature.
59|I can't allow my soul to be tarnished, after all.
59|Well then, that's that. See you later.
59|Wait up!
59|We finally ran into each other!
59|Let's make the most of it and chat a while longer!
59|Chat?
59|About what?
59|Good question...
59|Well, Araragi,
59|what did you study today?
59|I mainly tried to tackle maths.
59|Maths, you say?
59|Alas, I studied nought but Spanish today.
59|Spanish?
59|That's too bad. I don't know much Spanish.
59|That really is a shame.
59|Yeah, I can only manage a conversational level.
59|Spasibo!
59|That's Russian.
59|Also, it doesn't mean "that's great".
59|That's no good! You have to properly learn what words mean!
59|Yeah...
59|You sure do know everything.
59|I don't know everything.
59|I only know what I know.
59|At any rate!
59|It doesn't really matter who studied what.
59|A human's whole life is one of study.
59|What an astute thing to say, Araragi!
59|So why don't we focus on something more constructive...
59|Like, let's think of a way to better society!
59|Good idea.
59|What do you think should be done to end bullying?
59|Hanekawa,
59|isn't it about time you went home?
59|I'm about to leave myself.
59|Well, I was planning on going home soon anyway.
59|You shouldn't walk around
59|late at night.
59|You might come across a vampire.
59|Well, truth be told, I was kind of hoping for that to happen.
59|Even if I do think it's just a silly rumour,
59|there's a slim chance that I might get to meet a vampire.
59|Why?
59|Why would you want to meet something as dangerous as a vampire?
59|Well, I haven't thought too deeply about it.
59|I guess I'm at an age when I want to seek out the extraordinary.
59|It'd be nice to run into a vampire and have ourselves a conversation.
59|Are you fucking kidding me!?
59|Eh?
59|I'm sorry! Did what I say strike a nerve?
59|No. You get on my nerves.
59|Honestly, you piss me off.
59|I'm fed up with you.
59|I live a solitary life because I prefer being alone.
59|So don't follow me around.
59|B-But, Araragi,
59|where did this come from?
59|Weren't we having a friendly chat up until now?
59|There was nothing friendly about it.
59|I was only pretending to be your friend.
59|I was after your assets!
59|My family isn't particularly wealthy, you know!
59|I don't know if you're just trying to rack up points for a report card or what.
59|But Little Miss Honour Student
59|shouldn't be concerning herself with what a failure like me is up to!
59|You might be riding high on the ecstasy of your good deeds,
59|but I didn't ask for your damn sympathy!
59|And don't mess with my phone, either.
59|So do me a favour and just get lost.
59|I understand.
59|This is for the best.
59|I'm sure now...
59|I've become a bit more powerful as a person.
59|I've grown strong.
59|So...
59|So I'm sure
59|I'll be able to best Dramaturgy.
59|I'll be able to retrieve Kiss-shot's right leg.
59|I can easily overcome these obstacles.
59|That's the most important thing to me right now.
59|This pain in my heart isn't an issue.
59|What's wrong? Are you only going to flee?
59|Ye kin of Heart-Under-Blade!
59|Don't address me so anachronistically.
59|How's that!?
59|What are you playing at,
59|Dramaturgy!?
59|It is as it appears. I concede.
59|If you were to slam something like that into me with your strength,
59|I could not endure it.
59|It would take me two days to regenerate.
59|You might be under some misunderstanding,
59|but a vampire who can completely recover from damage instantaneously
59|is quite a rare being.
59|You're an exception which proves the rule.
59|After all, you are kin of the infamous Heart-Under-Blade.
59|As humiliating as my defeat is,
59|I thought I could use my extensive battle experience
59|to forge a path to victory.
59|But it seems it was a vain attempt.
59|There was no way for me to cut you down.
59|But, wait–
59|However,
59|will you be satisfied if I say this?
59|I shall never lay a hand on you again.
59|At the very least, please spare my life.
59|Well, for now,
59|I've retrieved the right leg.
59|What...
59|was that?
59|Hey, Araragi,
59|I was pretty far away, so I might be mistaken,
59|but were you just engaged in something straight out of an urban fantasy novel?
59|What's it to you?
59|Matter of fact,
59|what are you doing following me around?
59|I don't get you.
59|I'm pretty sure I told you not to.
59|Don't put on a friendly face and meddle in my affairs.
59|You're not the kind of person to say those things, are you?
59|I'm sorry I made you say those things.
59|I feel bad. But,
59|now I understand that you were forced into a position
59|where you had no choice but to say those things.
59|I'm sorry it took me so long to notice.
59|I'm sorry!
59|But I want to help you!
59|You make it seem like I'm in trouble.
59|Don't try to read so far into it.
59|I was just bored out of my mind whenever I was around you.
59|I like being alone.
59|That's a lie.
59|You don't hate people, nor are you jaded with the world.
59|You're not like that at all.
59|I understand that much.
59|At the very least, you seemed like you were enjoying yourself when we spent time together.
59|Are you shitting me? I told you, I was only after your assets!
59|I'm not bullshitting you! I already told you I'm not rich!
59|Then I was really after your Red Bull!
59|If you were that thirsty,
59|you should've just said so.
59|Different thirst! I meant I was as horny as a bull!
59|So did you want a Red Bull or were you horny like one?
59|Horny!
59|Well, how about this:
59|if you show me your panties again,
59|I wouldn't mind making amends.
59|Okay.
59|Huh?
59|Is this good enough?
59|Can you see them properly?
59|If not, should I take off my blouse as well?
59|Well?
59|I'm so sorry I said all those horrible things!
59|Please be my friend.
59|So he really just gave it back.
59|That's what you hired a mediator for.
59|Here you go, Heart-Under-Blade.
59|But what are you gonna do?
59|It's way bigger than your current legs.
59|It's not like you can just swap them out.
59|I just have to do this.
59|Do not stand there watching, you buffoons!
59|Allow me to dine in peace. Have you no manners?
59|So by the way, Oshino...
59|Hmm? What is it?
59|My left arm was blown clean off by Dramaturgy.
59|But it healed immediately.
59|So, that being the case,
59|why haven't Kiss-shot's limbs regenerated?
59|That's because by the time you met Heart-Under-Blade
59|she'd lost most of her vampiric immortality.
59|Wouldn't you think so?
59|Yeah, I did think that...
59|But, I...
59|When my arms were sliced off,
59|and they subsequently grew back,
59|the severed arms evaporated.
59|So I thought that maybe Kiss-shot's limbs had evaporated as well,
59|but that clearly isn't the case.
59|So I found myself wondering
59|why had they neither regenerated nor evaporated?
59|That girl is of a precious lineage, Araragi.
59|Those three flawlessly plundered her limbs
59|in order to take ownership of them.
59|They safely removed her limbs but left her body intact.
59|Get it?
59|In other words, what they stole was more than just her limbs,
59|but rather her very existence as a vampire.
59|Oshino,
59|Can I...
59|really go back to being human again?
59|Well, if you manage to reclaim all of Heart-Under-Blade's limbs,
59|you probably can.
59|That's what she said, didn't she?
59|Yeah, but couldn't she be lying?
59|She could've just been lying in order to get her limbs back and–
59|Come on now.
59|You shouldn't doubt her like that.
59|Don't you feel sorry for her?
59|But...
59|To be talking about the one who saved your life like that,
59|you're quite the ingrate.
59|Oi, come on now. What's with that face?
59|Did something good happen?
59|Don't act like you've seen through me.
59|Bleah!
59|So it's kind of my fault, isn't it?
59|What is?
59|That you ran into a vampire.
59|"Speak of the devil and he doth appear."
59|It seems like that saying applies almost perfectly to this situation.
59|That if you speak about them, these oddities will be attracted from the other side.
59|No, wait, that doesn't add up.
59|If that were the case,
59|shouldn't a vampire have had to appear before you, the person who told me about them in the first place?
59|It's not like it's set in stone.
59|When you get down to it, it only increases the odds of it occurring.
59|And even so, you could say a vampire did appear for me.
59|You, Araragi.
59|Sidelining the rumour talk for now, Hanekawa, yesterday
59|you were out looking for vampires of your own volition.
59|Why were you doing something like that?
59|A being which transcended humanity, was it?
59|And you wanted to speak with one?
59|Well, it's not as though I was searching in earnest.
59|I knew I was asking for the moon.
59|How do I put it...
59|I was stifled by life.
59|I was seeking out a change from my daily grind.
59|A change...
59|I suppose I was just trying to escape reality for a while.
59|Well, I want to return to that reality.
59|I'm sure you will.
59|I said before that I wanted to help you, but...
59|The scale of this thing's getting way out of hand.
59|There's probably not much that I can do for you.
59|That's not true.
59|I'm plenty grateful for you bringing me a change of clothes and other daily necessities.
59|It's fine. This is the least I could do.
59|More importantly, shouldn't you get changed? Those clothes are in tatters.
59|You're right.
59|So, umm...
59|Well, but...
59|I guess it'll be fine to change my top.
59|You're a medium size, right?
59|Ah, yeah...
59|I got a choice of both briefs and trunks for underwear.
59|What's the matter?
59|Not gonna change?
59|Yeah, I'm getting there.
59|Wait a moment!
59|I knew it! I thought so yesterday, but
59|your physique really has transformed.
59|Uh?
59|When I saw you from behind yesterday, I got the strangest feeling that it wasn't you.
59|The distribution of your muscle mass is different.
59|You're more slender, but more so you seem more toned.
59|When you become a vampire, your body undergoes certain changes.
59|The regenerative ability makes the body undergo a transformation to that of peak physical form.
59|Night.
59|Excuse me for a bit.
59|It feels...
59|No different to a normal human.
59|But it does feel as though your muscles are more elastic and resilient.
59|No different to a normal human...
59|Hanekawa, have you felt
59|the bodies of other men?
59|Eh!?
59|No! Not at all! Nothing like that!
59|You're right. I was only speaking based on my imagination.
59|That wasn't proper of me.
59|If you could put on your shirt...
59|S–Sure.
59|Looks good.
59|Thanks a bunch, Hanekawa.
59|I'll definitely return the favour someday.
59|It's fine.
59|This is about all I can do for you anyway.
59|But what you've done
59|is already too much.
59|From the bottom of my heart:
59|Thanks.
59|Not at all! A friend in need is a friend indeed!
59|If there's anything else I can do for you,
59|feel free to let me know, okay?
59|This is pretty much me doing my best though.
59|Oh, I know! I can tidy up this classroom.
59|It looks like it hasn't seen a broom in years.
59|You don't have to stress yourself. It was like this before I got here.
59|Well, even so, there's no reason to let disorder prevail.
59|I'd like to neaten up what I can.
59|Hmm?
59|What's this?
59|My servant left it behind.
59|He was grasping it so firmly as if it were very important,
59|so when I made my way here, I thought I'd better pick it up and bring it along.
59|Such misplaced magnanimity!
59|Night.
59|Umm...
59|So you had your run-in with a vampire on the way back from the bookstore?
59|On the 25th of March?
59|The night we had our first chat?
59|So, what's all this then?
59|So Episode's a vampire hunter, but a half-vampire.
59|Well, I can kind of understand the mediocrity that suggests,
59|but Kiss-shot,
59|can't you divulge any more detailed information?
59|I have forgotten.
59|You-
59|Be patient. I shall remember soon enough.
59|Now I remember.
59|And what do you remember?
59|Episode.
59|He absolutely despises vampires.
59|Despises?
59|Why?
59|Doesn't half mean he's 50% vampire himself?
59|Well, to put it bluntly,
59|half-vampires are not readily accepted by vampiric society.
59|That said, they are not accepted in the world of humans either.
59|As a result, he loathes his vampiric blood.
59|Above all else, it seems Episode holds an extreme hatred towards vampires.
59|In contrast to Dramaturgy, rather than because it's his occupation,
59|he acts out of personal feelings.
59|My sides!
59|It really cracks me up.
59|I can't believe old man Dramaturgy got his ass kicked by a brat like you.
59|Well, I'll be sure to eradicate your entire existence when I kill you.
59|Let me make it clear. Don't think I'll go easy on you.
59|I hate picking on the meek,
59|but I sure do love beating up bad guys!
59|So I'm the bad guy?
59|Well of course you are! You're a monster.
59|Then what about you?
59|Huh? What do you mean by that?
59|If you have something to say then spit it out!
59|No, it's nothing.
59|I don't want to say anything.
59|Let's get to it.
59|A cross?
59|Araragi!
59|You can't give up yet!
59|Your opponent is turning into mist!
59|So if he's mist, that means–
59|Hanekawa?
59|Hanekawa? Hanekawa!? Hanekawa!
59|Araragi...
59|Would you keep it down?
59|Pull yourself together. He's only mist.
59|Her sides.
59|Mist is just a form of water.
59|So what happens if you mix in dirt?
59|That's enough!
59|If you go any further, you'll forsake your humanity.
59|O–Oshi..
59|Y–You! You!
59|You let Hanekawa!
59|Don't fret so much.
59|You sure are feisty, Araragi.
59|Did something good happen?
59|I don't want to intrude on your good times, but,
59|the duel's already over.
59|Take a look. He's passed out.
59|But... But...
59|Hanekawa...
59|Hanekawa was!
59|Yeah. I saw.
59|Why were you just watching?
59|Why didn't you put a stop to it?!
59|It was a matter of payment.
59|I specialise in dealing with vampires.
59|I only received payment to mediate between those three.
59|Anything else costs extra.
59|Don't try and drag me into this.
59|Then you should've said so from the start!
59|If you'd only told me...
59|If you want me to help with the Class Prez's situation, you'll have to cough up another two million.
59|Two million?
59|I'd gladly pay three million!
59|Look around. This isn't a laughing matter, Oshino.
59|Not a laughing matter; but a business matter.
59|And with your offer of three million, our business is complete.
59|Now, I'll give you a hint.
59|Try using your head a little, Araragi.
59|What's the purpose of having an immortal body?
59|Hanekawa.
59|Araragi?
59|Why are you embracing my stomach so lovingly?
59|And it seems my uniform is a bit ripped. Could it be that you–
59|My bad, Hanekawa.
59|Let me stay like this...
59|Just a little while longer.
59|It feels as though my body's capabilities have improved considerably!
59|It is safe to say that I have reclaimed most of my immortality.
59|That so?
59|Does that mean I can leave you in charge of the next battle?
59|I am afraid not. Unfortunately, I can not yet use
59|any of my vampiric skills.
59|All it really means is that it is much harder for me to die than it was until now.
59|If the opponent was Dramaturgy, perhaps I could put up a fight,
59|but as I am now, I could not even defeat Episode.
59|I would not stand a chance against Guillotine-Cutter.
59|Guillotine-Cutter...
59|Is it safe to to call him human?
59|Indeed.
59|He is neither a vampire like Dramaturgy,
59|nor a half-vampire like Episode.
59|He is just a human. Pure and simple, through and through.
59|I find it hard to believe that he's "just a human".
59|Indeed.
59|Rightly so.
59|He is... How should I put it... A man of the cloth.
59|Surely he's not a member of the Christian Special Forces, right?
59|Close, yet far from the truth.
59|Back to the topic,
59|for all that he's still human.
59|No matter what tricks he may pull, surely he's no match for a fully fledged vampire.
59|He is a man, neither vampire nor half-vampire, who, in spite of that, specialises in vampire extermination.
59|On the contrary you ought to be extremely cautious.
59|It is fact that my two arms were plundered by that man.
59|That being said, I did have my guard down at that time.
59|And, for some reason, I was not at peak physical performance.
59|If Dramaturgy does it as a job,
59|and Episode hunts vampires because of a personal vendetta,
59|then Guillotine-Cutter is motivated by his sense of duty.
59|It is not for me to be saying this, but religion can be quite troubling.
59|How's your gut wound, Hanekawa?
59|It may have been a wound, but it didn't even leave a scar.
59|I see.
59|Well, let me take a look.
59|You're getting a bit ahead of yourself.
59|Hey, Araragi, do you want a sandwich?
59|These ones have tomato in them.
59|Ahh...
59|No, I'm fine.
59|Really?
59|Here, have a Coca-Cola.
59|Oh, thank you.
59|As for me I'll have a Diet Cola.
59|You naturally build up muscle now, so I wonder if your body can even turn calories into fat.
59|If not, you'd be the envy of girls everywhere.
59|I'm not sure.
59|If I had to describe it, I guess I just don't have an appetite.
59|Like, I'll be fine even if I don't eat anything.
59|Don't vampires consume blood as nourishment?
59|I guess so.
59|So you don't crave blood at all, or anything like that?
59|Well, now that you mention it, I guess I don't.
59|Hanekawa.
59|You probably shouldn't come around here anymore.
59|Well, I was thinking the same myself.
59|I'm begging you, please don't be hurt.
59|I mean it differently than before.
59|Before, I was of course moved by feelings of not wanting you to get involved,
59|but, to be honest, part of it was me not being able to control my own emotions.
59|I regret that I burst out in anger.
59|But it's different now.
59|In what way?
59|Yesterday, when Episode's cross spilled your guts...
59|I lost all reason.
59|Blood rushed to my head...
59|All I thought of was death.
59|Mine?
59|My own.
59|We talked about someone's strength as a person before.
59|Well when you took that blow, it hurt me as if I received it myself.
59|No, it actually hurt way more than when I get hit myself.
59|Hanekawa, I...
59|I don't think I could return to humanity again if it meant neglecting you.
59|Neglect...
59|Well, it's not as though it was my intention to make you do those things!
59|But...
59|Don't you wonder about what you're doing?
59|This is your precious spring vacation.
59|Yet you're wasting it by watching over a loser like me.
59|And in the end it nearly got you killed!
59|Haven't you thought about what you're doing?
59|N–Not at all!
59|I don't understand.
59|If our positions were reversed,
59|I'm not confident I could do what you've done.
59|You've placed yourself in mortal danger
59|when you're not even immortal.
59|I wouldn't be able to put my body on the line.
59|But you do it like it's nothing!
59|You're...
59|Terrifying.
59|Frankly, it's creepy.
59|Please, don't be hurt!
59|I don't mean it like that!
59|But why would you go so far just for me?
59|I don't get it at all!
59|We're only classmates who just got to know each other.
59|I don't understand how you can be so devoted!
59|You're basically a saint.
59|But all your self-sacrifice is too heavy a burden for me.
59|It's too much for me to bear.
59|I don't have that strength.
59|It's not self-sacrifice at all.
59|It's not self-sacrifice at all!
59|Then, what is it?
59|Self-satisfaction.
59|Araragi!
59|You're mistaken about me.
59|I'm not that good a person.
59|And I'm not a strong person either.
59|I just do things the way I want to.
59|There's probably no other person on the planet who only thinks about themselves as much as I do.
59|I'm cunning and I think I'm pretty selfish.
59|So much so that you'd be surprised.
59|But if it's difficult for you to do what you have to do because I'm around,
59|then that means that I've gotten my priorities backwards.
59|It's about time I retire from my role as errand girl.
59|It does seem like there's nothing more for me to accomplish.
59|Not quite. There's still something you can do.
59|You can wait for me.
59|When the new term starts, at that school.
59|Please be there waiting for me.
59|Because from the bottom of my heart
59|I look forward to chatting with you again.
59|Whoa there.
59|What was that sound?
59|My heart fluttering.
59|What? Girls have that kind of reaction when their hearts flutter?
59|That was too close.
59|I almost fell for you.
59|And by fall, do you mean
59|into a well or a hot spring?
59|You're always making girls swoon with that silver tongue of yours, aren't you?
59|Not at all! I don't know what you're insinuating.
59|For starters, I've barely even spoken to any girls.
59|Trying to deflect the question, eh?
59|That's bold for someone who bought such a raunchy book.
59|You're hopeless.
59|I'll lend you these.
59|Be sure to give them back once school starts.
59|You like panties, right?
59|Err...
59|But if you don't want them...
59|I never said that!
59|It's not a matter of whether I want them or not!
59|What were you saying? I just need to return them at the start of term?
59|My apologies. I cannot return these.
59|What?
59|Not in a million years.
59|These will be handed down and revered as an Araragi family heirloom for generations to come.
59|Please don't do that.
59|These panties have forever been separated from thy flesh!
59|You don't get to decide that!
59|I can't return your panties,
59|but in exchange
59|I will definitely repay my debt to you.
59|If there's ever a time you need someone,
59|even if I'm completely useless,
59|I will unconditionally be there for you.
59|Fulfilling my obligation to you,
59|will from this day forth be my reason to live.
59|I don't care! Just give me back my panties!
59|I have to go home now,
59|in this petrifyingly beezy skirt,
59|whilst not wearing any panties.
59|Compared to that, beating Guillotine-Cutter in your final duel
59|shouldn't be so difficult!
59|You got that right!
59|Well, I wish the best of luck!
59|Good luck to you too!
59|We'll see each other at school!
59|See you at school!
59|My bad. I messed up.
59|Class Prez has been kidnapped.
59|What should I do?
59|What the hell should I do!?
59|Araragi,
59|forsake your humanity.
59|Araragi...
59|I'm sorry, Araragi...
59|I...
59|You bastard!
59|What do you plan on doing to Hanekawa?
59|Nothing at all.
59|As long as you don't pull any fast ones.
59|I may not possess the supernatural strength your kind is renown for,
59|but I am quite well trained.
59|And I can certainly kill
59|a single girl with ease.
59|And yet you still call yourself human?
59|Hanekawa,
59|it's all right.
59|I'll definitely save you.
59|That's rather unpleasant.
59|I'm not tolerant enough to stomach
59|your make-believe high school camaraderie.
59|We should get started soon.
59|And what exactly should I do
59|once we start?
59|The moment the duel has been declared begun,
59|you are to raise your hands and say "I give up".
59|In other words, put an end to the battle the moment it begins.
59|Got it.
59|A–Araragi!
59|Don't worry about me!
59|There's no way I couldn't worry!
59|If I can't see you anymore, there's no point in being a human anyway!
59|Araragi.
59|Now I really can't...
59|claim to be human.
59|I threw away my humanity.
59|I know that.
59|I'm already...
59|a monster.
59|I was bored witless for the longest time.
59|But you, servant of mine, did not allow me my malaise.
59|I'm getting outta here. Job's done.
59|It did end as a failure, though.
59|I told you, didn't I? If you knew the real me, you'd be disillusioned.
59|It's my fault...
59|My fault...
59|My fault!
59|You did not save me because I was I.
59|If they were in need, you would have saved anyone.
59|Please die, my master!
59|Thou art to perish, servant of mine!
59|A-Araragi...
59|P–Please...
59|Please be so kind as to fondle my bare-skinned breasts.
59|A star, and you
59|And you, and me
59|The world is beautiful
59|And you are my world
59|A star, and you
59|And you, and me
59|All that I see
59|And all that I feel
59|You are my universe
59|I want to hear you call my name
59|I want to feel your presence in my arms
59|And for this love to last for eternity
59|A star, and you
59|And you, and me
59|You are my universe
59|I want to hear you call my name
59|I want to feel your presence in my arms
59|Yes, this love will last for eternity

59|You are my universe

59|Cold-blooded Chapter
60|Is that...?
60|Yes, it's what you think it is.
60|Heart-Under-Blade's arms are inside.
60|I see.
60|Hmm?
60|Ah. I get what you want to say.
60|"I'm surprised that Guillotine-Cutter fellow actually held up his end of the bargain", right?
60|That's quite a grudge you got there.
60|Well, it's understandable.
60|In Guillotine-Cutter's defence, though,
60|unlike the other two, he does this out of a sense of duty.
60|Well, at any rate, now you've retrieved all of the limbs.
60|Congratulations, Araragi.
60|Whoa there, Araragi.
60|I'm congratulating you.
60|What's with the displeasure written all over your face?
60|However the means,
60|the completion of one's objectives should be a matter of pleasure.
60|But you, on the other hand, are emitting an aura one might find at a wake.
60|There's something I don't quite get,
60|Oshino.
60|Guillotine-Cutter,
60|not to mention
60|Dramaturgy and Episode,
60|together they
60|made away with Kiss-shot's arms and legs.
60|But going up against them was me,
60|a guy whose entire combat experience can be chalked up to tussling with his little sisters.
60|If you look at it objectively, my defeat was all but inevitable.
60|So how the hell
60|did it end up like this?
60|Were they just overly weak,
60|or was I...
60|just overwhelmingly powerful?
60|The answer's both.
60|From their point of view, you appeared insurmountably strong.
60|And from your point of view they were, of course, underwhelming pushovers.
60|Because after all,
60|the infamous, the one and only
60|Kiss-shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade
60|has but a single kin.
60|But that can't be the only reason—
60|That is the reason.
60|I'm trying to say that if that is the reason, it doesn't make any sense!
60|If you look at it under those assumptions,
60|it doesn't add up.
60|If I achieved so much as her kin,
60|then she herself operating at full power,
60|even if they were working together,
60|should've been able to mop the floor with them.
60|But what if I were to tell you that at that time
60|Heart-Under-Blade wasn't operating at full power?
60|That changes things, does it not?
60|Well I was planning on giving it to you whether you probed me or not,
60|but I'm glad you did ask.
60|The conversation flows much more smoothly this way.
60|Araragi.
60|You're quite perceptive, every now and then.
60|This is the heart of Kiss-shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.
60|She was not in possession of that heart
60|when she did battle with those vampire hunters.
60|Given that fact, it wasn't all that improbable that she lost her limbs.
60|She doesn't know,
60|does she?
60|Probably not.
60|She only thinks she lost her extremities.
60|I see.
60|So that's how it went.
60|I thought he was one sly bastard,
60|that Guillotine-Cutter.
60|But I never would have guessed he snatched out her heart as well.
60|Nah, that ain't it, Araragi.
60|The one who stole her heart
60|wasn't Guillotine-Cutter.
60|Then who did?
60|Me.
60|I took great care
60|in stealthily extracting her heart.
60|You're...
60|Capable of such a feat?
60|Sure am.
60|So that means,
60|even if she got all her limbs back,
60|Kiss-shot couldn't regain
60|her full strength, right?
60|Yeah, that's right.
60|So you were
60|meant to have to take back her heart from me after all that.
60|You were to fight me as your fourth opponent.
60|And, in doing so, an equilibrium would have been struck.
60|You!?
60|Fight you?
60|Meant to, yes.
60|But I'm not inclined to anymore.
60|I mean, I've already given you back the heart.
60|I'm really sorry
60|about what happened to your Class Prez.
60|It's quite rare that an ordinary person would get involved
60|in a case to such an extent.
60|Normally, people run away from oddities.
60|That girl actually has a bit of a grasp on the real situation, doesn't she?
60|And with that,
60|all the parts that Kiss-shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade had lost
60|have been reclaimed.
60|That is to say, now you can become human again.
60|Let me congratulate you once again.
60|Feel free to rejoice.
60|Ah, that reminds me.
60|This is just out of curiosity,
60|but have you had any hunger pangs recently?
60|Uh, no.
60|I think I mentioned this before,
60|but ever since I became a vampire and acquired immortality,
60|I haven't had much of an appetite at all.
60|That may be,
60|but sooner or later I think you'll get hungry.
60|It has been two weeks, after all.
60|It must've been rough, eh?
60|Well then, Araragi.
60|After you're a human again,
60|do be careful as to avoid any rash decisions.
60|After a person makes contact with an oddity,
60|it's easier for them to encounter one again.
60|Be careful.
60|Oi, what are you on about?
60|You make it sound like you're leaving for good.
60|I am leaving.
60|My job's done.
60|I did make quite a mess of it, though.
60|But what's transpired has transpired, what's done is done.
60|Ah.
60|Before I forget, Araragi.
60|About that two million you owe me,
60|and the extra three million for Class Prez,
60|let's call it even.
60|Don't glare at me like that,
60|I'm not pulling a fast one.
60|This just sets my mind at ease.
60|If a balance has been reached, I'm not gonna rock the boat.
60|So on that note,
60|give my regards to Class Prez.
60|What's his deal?
60|Kizumonogatari
60|III: The Ice-Blooded Chapter
60|Yahoo!
60|I'm back!
60|I'm back, baby!
60|Kiss-shot.
60|About Oshino,
60|he left in the afternoon.
60|And what about it?
60|I was just wondering.
60|Shouldn't you be angry about your heart?
60|I care not. Not at all.
60|I shall overlook it.
60|I mean, who gives a shit!
60|Uh, Kiss-shot.
60|I'm sorry to rain on your parade,
60|but if it's okay with you,
60|I'd rather become human again as soon as possible.
60|Ah.
60|'Tis understandable.
60|Fret not.
60|I shall return thy humanity.
60|However, dear servant,
60|before we get to that,
60|shall we have a chat?
60|Now then,
60|what shall we discuss?
60|You didn't have something you wanted to talk about?
60|I suppose the way I phrased it was not quite right.
60|I did not have any one thing I wanted to converse about,
60|but rather I merely wanted to hold a conversation; the subject matters not.
60|And is doing that something which is essential
60|in turning me back into a human?
60|Is it vital.
60|To me, at least.
60|Well,
60|you've lived for over 500 years.
60|I'm sure there's lots for you to talk about.
60|There is nothing exciting, really.
60|My life has been one of fighting to the death with people such as those three.
60|At a fundamental level, it has been quite a tedious 500 years.
60|I suppose...
60|If I must speak of something,
60|the only matter of importance is the tale of that man.
60|I previously spoke of you being the second kin I have produced.
60|So now
60|I shall speak of the first of my kindred.
60|Yeah, you did mention that.
60|That I was your second after 400 years.
60|Was he kinda like me?
60|Why would you think that?
60|Uh... Well... Err...
60|The only similary between you two
60|is thine ethnicity.

60|Ueda Hajime
60|Nisio Isin
60|That man was a warrior.
60|One which I could entrust my rear flank to.
60|A very skilled warrior.
60|I see.
60|But you said we shared ethnicity?
60|Indeed. He was Japanese.
60|During the period in which I was relishing my youth and travelling the globe,
60|I met that man when I came to this country.
60|It was at that time that I learned Japanese.
60|But it seems the language has changed rather extensively.
60|But if so,
60|couldn't you have called upon him this time as well?
60|Impossible.
60|He has long since perished.
60|And that, as well,
60|happened a very long time ago.
60|Do you recall?
60|I believe I mentioned that
60|when I venture into battle I wield a certain sword.
60|And that weapon
60|is a memento of his.
60|The Magic Blade:
60|Heartspan.
60|It may be a nameless item from an eastern land,
60|but apparently quite the myth surrounds it.
60|Do not move.
60|I just cut you.
60|Huh?
60|Is there any pain?
60|N-No.
60|That means my skills have not dulled.
60|You may move again.
60|It has healed.
60|What do you mean?
60|What healed?
60|I don't think it cut deep enough to require healing.
60|Where exactly did you slice?
60|I split thee in two.
60|Once again, I have cut a worthless object.
60|Who are you calling worthless!?
60|Worry not about thy clothes.
60|The sharpness of Heartspan's bladed edge is authentic.
60|So much so that if you but leave the threads alone they shall twine themselves back together.
60|Of course,
60|that is only if I am the one wielding the blade.
60|That man died
60|and left this as a memento mori.
60|For an immortal vampire to have died,
60|that means,
60|he was exterminated by a hunter?
60|Nay.
60|He was not the sort of man to be slain according to another's will.
60|Then how?
60|Suicide.
60|Tedium will kill a man.
60|Is what they say, is it not?
60|In most instances,
60|a vampire will grow tired of existence after about 200 years.
60|So if there was one odd thing about that man,
60|it was that he only lived a few years as a vampire
60|before he chose his own death.
60|Even though in that short time, nothing had really changed,
60|he perished before my very eyes.
60|I stared at him blazing under the sun,
60|as I was forced to watch his death.
60|Ever since
60|I did not produce more kin.
60|Until I met you, that is.
60|Weren't you ever bored?
60|I was bored witless
60|for the longest time.
60|However,
60|you did not allow me my malaise,
60|dear servant of mine.
60|You threw yourself headfirst into whatever needed to be done.
60|You are probably the first human in history
60|to willingly offer his neck to a vampire.
60|Not to mention you called me Kiss-short from the start.
60|Now then,
60|it is time.
60|Shall we return thy humanity?
60|Yeah.
60|Now that I think about it,
60|did your first kin
60|ever say he wanted to be human again?
60|The me of that time
60|could not possibly deliver him back unto humanity even if he so wished it.
60|This time I intend
60|to make amends for what I could not do.
60|So,
60|are you prepared?
60|Well,
60|I think I laughed a bit much.
60|I'm feeling a bit peckish.
60|Can we put something in our bellies first?
60|Very well.
60|It is true that since regaining my true form
60|I have been tinged with hunger.
60|Can you procure some of those mobile snacks?
60|"Mobile snacks"?
60|Well,
60|this is my last night as a vampire.
60|Might as well go out with a bang.
60|Is there anything in particular you want to eat?
60|I have no real preference.
60|Anything shall suffice.
60|Make fruitful of the night, dear servant of mine.
60|If only for a short while, you have been a fine servant.
60|Sate your spirits.
60|I shall be preparing on the second floor.
60|Got it.
60|So I guess
60|she really is going away somewhere.
60|Can't do anything about it.
60|If there is a meeting,
60|there will surely be a farewell.
60|Even if to Kiss-shot
60|these two weeks have been full of nothing but bad memories,
60|looking back on it now,
60|to me,
60|it wasn't that bad a spring break.
60|It wasn't that bad at all.
60|Following our little chat on the roof,
60|we'll have ourselves a farewell party.
60|And then, finally, I'll properly say some words of parting
60|to Kiss-shot, in earnest.
60|I'm back!
60|Oh, dear servant.
60|That was quicker than expected.
60|However, I believe I made myself clear before:
60|It is only proper manners to leave a lady to herself when she eats.
60|Whilst I was awaiting thy return,
60|this one decided to pay us a visit.
60|And of course I could penetrate
60|the barrier and discover him easily with my full power.
60|And what is this?
60|Did you not bring along that mobile snack
60|with the glasses and the plait?
60|I believed men of such raw faith to be rather unappetising.
60|However!
60|This is quite the delicacy!
60|I thought myself to not have preferences,
60|but whoever said that "hunger is the ultimate spice"
60|really knew what they were talking about!
60|No...
60|You can't eat...
60|a human being.
60|But,
60|dear servant,
60|if I do not eat, I shall perish.
60|For her entire existence
60|she has eaten.
60|She has continually sated her hunger.
60|Her first kin.
60|And the second.
60|During her 500 years,
60|she's only stopped at just drinking blood
60|for her two kindred.
60|Every other human being
60|has been, in that violent manner,
60|torn to shreds,
60|leaving neither meat nor bone,
60|and consumed as food.
60|For that is how she acquires nutrients
60|when she is not producing kin.
60|From now own, whenever Kiss-shot eats a human,
60|whenever she sates her appetite,
60|it will undoubtedly be
60|due to my actions.
60|If Hanekawa is eaten,
60|if my sisters are eaten,
60|if my parents are eaten,
60|that would be entirely
60|my fault.
60|It's my fault becaused I saved her.
60|My fault.
60|My fault!
60|I can't...
60|Take it anymore.
60|I can't stand the thought of it.
60|It makes me sick.
60|But I, too,
60|am a vampire.
60|Ah, that reminds me.
60|have you had any
60|hunger pangs recently?
60|What do I do about this?
60|I have to die.
60|There's no other option.
60|Yes, that's right.
60|But,
60|I really want to speak to Hanekawa.
60|I deleted both her mobile number
60|and her email of my own accord.
60|In front of her very eyes.
60|In order to inflict lasting pain on her.
60|I purged everything.
60|I thought I told her
60|not to just mess
60|with my phone.
60|Your girl has been delivered.
60|What do I say about this?
60|I've been tricked into coming to the gymnasium storage room and now we're trapped!
60|If Araragi decides to play an indecent trick on me,
60|whatever will I do?
60|Flashlight:
60|on!
60|Ah!
60|We're sitting like this because you want to peek at my panties.
60|You are under a gross misunderstanding as to the kind of man I am.
60|For example, if before my very eyes,
60|a stark naked woman was standing there,
60|and she told me not to look at her,
60|I would be able to resist looking.
60|That's true for most people.
60|No, I mean, Hanekawa,
60|you just don't understand the extent
60|to which I am a gentlemen.
60|"Gentlemen" is a plural.
60|But, well,
60|if you are speaking the truth,
60|I'm looking forward to seeing it.
60|Looking forward...
60|to what?
60|Well, when the new school term starts,
60|I'll be able to see lots and lots
60|of your gentle side, won't I?
60|So that's why...
60|You can't...
60|Die...
60|You're not allowed
60|to die.
60|If you're thinking about things like that,
60|it just proves that you're running away from your feelings.
60|You...
60|You're amazing.
60|You're...
60|incredible.
60|When I'm here with you
60|I finally realise what an insignificant human I am.
60|If I hadn't met you,
60|I would have probably died a lot earlier.
60|That's why I'm trying to say...
60|You just can't go and die!
60|Listen to what
60|I have to say.
60|Everything's...
60|my fault.
60|My reckless actions
60|have led to this miserable result.
60|You know, I...
60|when I yielded my blood to Kiss-shot,
60|I never would have ever fathomed
60|that any of this would happen.
60|It's my fault that...
60|a person died.
60|It isn't your fault, Araragi.
60|And besides,
60|from Heart-Under-Blade's point of view,
60|that would've been a very mundane occurance.
60|It's the same to her as
60|eating cows and pigs
60|is to us, right?
60|Yeah.
60|So Kiss-shot isn't at fault.
60|The one at fault here is me.
60|It's all my fault.
60|No one else did anything wrong.
60|Besides,
60|I never
60|thought, even once, that
60|Dramaturgy,
60|Episode,
60|and Guillotine-Cutter—
60|that those three were on the side of human justice.
60|I became an enemy of humanity.
60|So is that why
60|you've given up on
60|becoming human again?
60|Have you forsaken your humanity?
60|Didn't you say that you really...
60|wanted to become human...
60|to come back to reality!?
60|Now that there's a victim,
60|granting my own desires
60|would be far too selfish of me.
60|If you want to talk about selfishness,
60|aren't you being far more selfish
60|acting the way you are now?
60|I mean,
60|you want to throw everything you've done into the wind
60|and just run away from it all!
60|You're just running away,
60|in body and soul!
60|You're wrong.
60|I don't want to run away.
60|I want to take responsibility.
60|Extinguishing this immortal body with my own hands
60|is the least I can do to atone for my sins.
60|If you try to erase sin with sin,
60|you'll only add to your sins.
60|Suicide is, after all,
60|a sin.
60|Hanekawa...
60|Hanekawa.
60|Hm?
60|As I am now, I'm not a human being.
60|I'm a vampire.
60|So...
60|I'm not like you.
60|I'm a weak person.
60|So if I don't die now, I'm sure, given time,
60|I'll give into the temptation to feed.
60|Hanekawa...
60|Sooner or later I'll only be able to view you as something to be eaten.
60|So then eat me.
60|Wha—
60|What are you saying?
60|If I can't die for a person,
60|then I wouldn't call that person my friend.
60|I told you that you'd be disillusioned by how I really am.
60|What in the world....
60|are you?
60|Hmm?
60|I believe that I'm your friend.
60|No ordinary person...
60|Would go that far for a friend.
60|I asked you this before,
60|but how are you able to go so far for someone you just recently met?
60|If you're that devoted to just anyone, you wouldn't have nearly enough lives to give.
60|But you're not just anyone.
60|I can do this because it's you, Araragi.
60|Besides, if it's just to save one little Araragi,
60|putting a single body on the line is more than enough!
60|So that's why...
60|you can't die.
60|Don't die.
60|There's no one who can stop
60|Kiss-shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade,
60|when she's at her full strength.
60|I'm responsible for her recovery,
60|and she'll continuing eating people without batting an eyelash.
60|It was impossible for Gullotine-Cutter,
60|so Dramaturgy or Episode wouldn't put up any sort of fight.
60|The only one with a slight chance, Oshino,
60|will never do anything that upsets the balance.
60|To him,
60|everything relating to Kiss-shot has already been settled.
60|There's no one who can put a stop to that vampire.
60|Even you?
60|Wouldn't you be able to stop her?
60|In fact,
60|you're the only left who can stop her.
60|Aren't you, her only kin,
60|conversely, the only one who can put a stop to her?
60|On your marks...
60|Get set...
60|I will... Go up against Kiss-shot.
60|Your expression's changed.
60|It'll be fine.
60|I will definitely exterminate her.
60|Well then, I'll have to help you out, of course.
60|If there's anything I can do, don't hesitate to ask.
60|I say that but, I can't think of any lewder acts you could ask of me more than what I've already done.
60|Hanekawa.
60|What is it?
60|Would you allow me to touch your breasts?
60|Your bre—
60|I heard you.
60|Um... And why exactly is that necessary?
60|It is extremely necessary.
60|You haven't seen it yet.
60|Kiss-shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade's fully powered
60|form, that is.
60|Well, no.
60|But I've seen her 12 and 17 year old forms so
60|I can kind of imagine what her 27 year old form is like.
60|It is most likely beyond that.
60|She has a bust beyond your wildest imagination.
60|Bust?
60|I am deathly afraid that I'll be distracted by her voluptuous bosom and be defeated because of it.
60|Those breasts of hers will probably be swaying madly during the fight.
60|So in order to counteract that, I need to build up a tolerance to a woman's breasts.
60|That's a far more trivial reason than I was expecting.
60|Doesn't the flow of logic make a bit of sense?
60|Very well!
60|What? Really?!
60|Just...
60|wait a bit.
60|Araragi.
60|Yes?
60|If you're going to fondle them, do it properly.
60|Properly?
60|You should fondle them for at least sixty seconds.
60|Sixty seconds!?
60|Do not hold back!
60|You know what, Hanekawa...
60|Could I get you to face the other way?
60|Looking you in the eyes during...
60|Would be a bit rough.
60|Raise your arms in the air.
60|What is this, radio calisthenics?
60|You won't be mad later?
60|It's okay. I won't get mad.
60|You mean it?
60|I mean it.
60|Well then, you know...
60|In the unlikely event that this goes to court...
60|"Araragi, would you be so kind as to fondle my bra-less breasts".
60|"I beg of you". Could you say that for me?
60|A-Araragi!
60|Would you be so kind as to fondle my bra-less breasts...
60|I... I beg of you.
60|No. Saying it in such a soft voice won't do at all.
60|It's almost as if I'm forcing you
60|to say it against your will.
60|You have to speak up and tell me exactly where and what you want.
60|You have to say it of your own volition.
60|A-Araragi!
60|Please be so kind as to fondle my bra-less breasts!
60|I beg of you!
60|"It would be the greatest honour to have my breasts fondled by you, Araragi."
60|It would be...
60|the greatest honour...
60|to have my breasts fondled by you, Araragi.
60|Let's see...
60|"I nurtured these lascivious breasts for the sole purpose of getting them fondled by you, Araragi."
60|I nurtured these lascivious breasts...
60|For the sole purpose of getting them fondled by you, Araragi.
60|Is that so? It sure doesn't look that way.
60|You're quite raunchy, aren't you?
60|Yes, I'm very perverted.
60|I'm sorry!
60|There's no need to apologise, really.
60|No matter how lewd you are, Hanekawa,
60|it's not as if you're causing anyone any problems.
60|That's true...
60|And so?
60|How exactly are the breasts of our diligent, yet indecent, class president lewd?
60|Their size and softness...
60|There exists no other pair of breasts as conceitedly lewd as these!
60|So that's it. I understand now.
60|My entire life was for the purpose of this moment.
60|The person known as Araragi Koyomi was born into this world
60|just to experience this day!
60|What was I doing? I can't just fondle my friend's breasts!
60|This isn't right! We can't do this!
60|Chicken.
60|Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.
60|I'm a chicken! I'm a disappointment! I'm sorry!
60|I was swayed by your unwavering kindess!
60|However! My eyes have been opened by your actions!
60|Do you think you'll get off that easily?
60|Do you understand how much resolve it took
60|to be sitting here as I am now?
60|N-no.
60|A worthless person such as myself could not even begin to grasp it.
60|B-but how resolved were you, by the way?
60|Would you be so kind as to let me ask that?
60|To be frank, I was ready for it to go past mere breast fondling.
60|I thought "Ahh, this is how it's gonna go."
60|"My first time is gonna be on top of a mat in the gymnasium storage room."
60|Were you perhaps jumping the gun just a little?
60|Well, I thought it could happen.
60|IT COULD'VE!?
60|And yet, you put me through
60|a very embarassing situation
60|and didn't even lay a finger on me!
60|Araragi, am I really that unattractive?
60|How does a shoulder massage sound instead?
60|Shoulder?
60|Yes, your shoulders.
60|I want to massage your shoulders.
60|That concludes my service. Thank you very much.
60|Are you done?
60|Yes. See what happens next on the web.
60|As if I'll get fondled on the web!
60|Then how about, we pick this up in the new semester?
60|You're right.
60|If you forced a girl through all this, there's no way that you're planning on losing now, right?
60|Yo.
60|I didn't think you'd be coming to me.
60|I shall say this once.
60|Servant of mine, whilst the sun was shining between us, I managed to grasp the intent behind your feelings.
60|I understand why you grew so irate.
60|I understand the reason.
60|I think that I did not give due consideration to your position as a former human.
60|So just this once,
60|I will ask this of you:
60|return to my side.
60|Live alongside me.
60|My life was saved by you.
60|You are an eccentric fellow, but that is exactly why I feel I can live alongside you.
60|Do you have no wish to exist with me for all of eternity?
60|I do not.
60|You ate someone.
60|That's reason enough for me.
60|If that is your understanding,
60|then why did you save me?
60|Why did you not leave me to die?
60|I didn't understand a single damn thing.
60|No, that's not right.
60|I actually did understand from the start.
60|But I averted my eyes to that fact.
60|Because I thought I wanted to die for your sake.
60|So what I'm saying,
60|is that I pardoned your consumption of people.
60|But I never even imagined that people would die because of it.
60|My feelings may have been beautiful in their concept,
60|but they were not righteous.
60|I thought you would say as such.
60|I wanted to hear you say that.
60|Now I can extinguish all hesitation.
60|Dear servant,
60|I had an inclination from the very beginning.
60|I thought that you were perhaps that sort of person.
60|Your kindness was
60|only directed towards me whilst I was weak.
60|H Y P O C R I T E !
60|That's right. I understood.
60|Now that I have regained my full power,
60|I think that
60|you have no interest in me any longer.
60|You did not save me because I was me.
60|You would have saved anyone, had they shown weakness.
60|H Y P O C R I T E !
60|W a a h
60|Come now. Draw closer, servant.
60|If you kill me with your own hands,
60|you can reclaim your beloved humanity.
60|Kiss-shot,
60|there's something
60|I would like to ask you.
60|Really?
60|Go ahead.
60|As a parting gift for the underworld,
60|I shall answer anything you ask.
60|Ask away.
60|To you,
60|what is a human?
60|A meal.
60|I wanted to hear you say that.
60|Please die, my master!
60|Thou art to perish, servant of mine!
60|Excellent! This is the very essence of a fight to the death between vampiric bretheren!
60|More! Do it more, servant!
60|By the way, I will tell you something nice, servant.
60|It is unfortunate that these will be my parting words to you.
60|What?
60|The truth is, I too was once human.
60|A former human.
60|That is to say, the very same as you and Dramaturgy.
60|Weren't you a pure blood?
60|I have forgotten most of my time as a human, however,
60|apparently I was from quite a good pedigree.
60|Well, to a vampire of over 300 years,
60|purity and kindred no longer hold much meaning.
60|And so what of it!?
60|Nothing. I had just forgotten, is all.
60|I remembered something when I was with you last night.
60|I think you should know.
60|When I first ate human flesh, I recall that I hesitated.
60|If that's the case—
60|Even for you,
60|the sense of guilt would disappear for each human you consumed.
60|Kiss-shot,
60|I am a human being.
60|Is that so? I am a vampire.
60|It's finally time for the final Japanese athletes to take their places.
60|They have withstood many tribulations on their path to glory.
60|And now, the youth of Japan step up, full of pride.
60|Looking back, Tokyo was to have held the 1940 Olympics Games.
60|But the rising conflict shattered many dreams.
60|Five years prior, the atheletes for the competition were decided in Tokyo.
60|And then over the next five years, all their efforts have lead up to this moment...
60|Hold it right there!
60|Araragi, something isn't right!
60|Hanekawa, hurry up and go hide!
60|No, you don't get it. Something's been off for a while!
60|I think we've been overlooking something very important this entire time.
60|You're a nuisance!
60|Don't you dare say anything unnecessary, you mobile snack.
60|Heart-Under-Blade,
60|could it be that you—
60|You damnable human!
60|Don't butt in!
60|What is the matter, dear servant?
60|I still have about half of my blood left.
60|Having had so much of my blood drained, I can no longer move.
60|However, if you do not put an end to me soon, I shall soon rejuvenate.
60|How exactly were you planning on making me human again?
60|Does such a thing really matter to you as you are now?
60|Heart-Under-Blade,
60|did you intend for Araragi to kill you from the very start?
60|In order to for him to become human again?
60|Do not jest, mobile snack.
60|What are you basing that on?
60|Then how exactly were you planning on making him human again?
60|Please tell us that.
60|You already know.
60|I had no intention of returning this servant of mine to humanity at all.
60|I merely fed him falsehoods so that he would retrieve my extremities.
60|You're lying.
60|The reason you got him to reclaim all your parts was because, if you were not complete,
60|his killing of you wouldn't return his humanity.
60|There was no meaning behind his killing of you unless you were fully complete.
60|You were
60|planning on dying.
60|And what exactly do you hope to gain by saying all this?
60|Do you really believe my servant can kill me now that he has heard all of that?
60|W-Why...
60|Why would you do any of that...
60|I was already looking for a place to die.
60|I thought it would be nice to die.
60|Or at least I did.
60|However, at the last moment, I became afraid of death.
60|After 500 years of existence, I was terrified of suddenly disappearing.
60|The thought of no longer existing scared me, frightened me to no end.
60|It was the first time in my life that a stranger lent me aid.
60|From neither human nor vampire
60|had I ever received assistance.
60|And so, as I was extracting your kind blood, I began to question my actions.
60|So please,
60|allow me to die for your sake.
60|I could not die for his sake.
60|I could not bring myself to die for him.
60|I could not bequeath his humanity unto him.
60|So please...
60|What is this? Art thou crying?
60|You sure are a crybaby.
60|How pathetic for a servant of mine.
60|No, these aren't tears.
60|This is... this is just...
60|Blood. My blood is just flowing.
60|Blood flows within you as well, doesn't it?
60|Good grief. You really took some unwarranted action, mobile snack.
60|I was planning on letting my guard down at an inauspicious juncture and forfeiting my life...
60|But this is fine.
60|For you have no other option other than to kill me, after all.
60|For if you cannot kill me, every day from tomorrow henceforth I shall feast on 1000 humans.
60|And, knowing that, now your only choice is to kill me.
60|To prove that was no idle threat, if I seize that mobile snack at the outset,
60|you shall witness my determination.
60|You should be accountable for those you save.
60|That is what they call a "sense of responsibility", is it not?
60|Kiss-shot!
60|You are the second to call me by that name.
60|But you shall be the last.
60|Now, you are to kill me,
60|dear servant.
60|Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. DO IT!
60|Damn it all!
60|Oshino! Oshino Meme!
60|I know you're watching this from somewhere!
60|So stop dicking around and show yourself!
60|I finally understand everything you were trying to tell me!
60|I'm not looking for any explanations anymore, so get out here already!
60|I know exactly what position I'm in!
60|So show yourself, Oshino Meme!
60|You don't have to yell that loudly; I can hear you.
60|What a coincidence, meeting you in a place like this, Araragi!
60|Oshino!
60|This is the feistiest I've ever seen somebody.
60|Did something good happen?
60|I have a job for you.
60|Do something about this.
60|Do something? That's rather vague.
60|I'll pay you.
60|It's not an issue of finances.
60|Then what is the problem?
60|It's your own personal problem.
60|Don't try and force it.
60|Heya, Class Prez.
60|This is our first meeting, right?
60|It's nice to meet you. I'm Hanekawa.
60|Don't get in the way, brat.
60|Wasn't that the deal?
60|I have no recollection of making a deal with you,
60|Heart-Under-Blade.
60|I merely wished to accumulate all the information I could acquire.
60|In order to restore Araragi's humanity,
60|your choice of self-sacrifice
60|suited my needs perfectly, is all.
60|So, what're you gonna do?
60|You've got a job request for a specialist like me, don't you?
60|For the fee, let's see...
60|let's set it at the five million we called even before.
60|Now, what's the request?
60|I want you to tell me a way for everyone to be satisfied.
60|A way I can put an end to this without anyone being dissatisfied.
60|There's no way that's possible.
60|Are you an idiot?
60|However, there is a way for everyone to be dissatisfied.
60|That is to say, there may be a method for divvying up
60|the unhappiness between multiple parties.
60|No one single person's wishes would be fulfilled, but if you're fine with that I'll tell you the way.
60|Specifically you would have to... How do I put this...
60|Suck the life out of Heart-Under-Blade until the very last moment, Araragi.
60|She would lose almost all her vampiric skills and characteristics.
60|On the brink of death she would become something that is even less Heart-Under-Blade than her prior forms.
60|She would be a husk, with no shadow, no form, and not even a name left to her.
60|We'd have her assume an existence of a pseudo-vampire mimicking a human.
60|No matter how much she hungered, she would be unable to eat any humans.
60|A pitiful existence such as that.
60|And, as for you, Araragi, you wouldn't become human either.
60|However, you would be very close to human.
60|Araragi, you would be a pseudo-human mimicking a vampire.
60|Strictly speaking, you couldn't be classified as human, but you would be far away from vampirism.
60|You would assume that sort of half-baked existence.
60|It'd suit you well.
60|However, if settled like that, Heart-Under-Blade, unable to procure nutrients, would starve to death.
60|The only source of nourishment left to Heart-Under-Blade,
60|in her diminished state, would be the blood flowing in your neck, Araragi.
60|You would have to support Heart-Under-Blade for the rest of your life,
60|and Heart-Under-Blade would be tied to you for the rest of her life.
60|So, that means, us humans would—
60|That's right. The humans would abandon their extermination
60|of these vampires.
60|However, a certain risk would remain.
60|Heart-Under-Blade and Araragi could possibly return to vampirism
60|and start eating humans. That would be an ever-present risk, one which could not be ignored.
60|Stop spouting such nonsense, you brat!
60|I do not wish to live on in such a pitiful condition!
60|I will die! Let me die for his sake!
60|Kill me! Hurry up and put an end to me!
60|I do not wish to live any longer!
60|Like I said, you'd be dealing with some dissatisfaction.
60|Your desires would not come to fruition.
60|And besides, the one who gets to decide is Araragi.
60|Servant!
60|Dear servant... Servant of mine...
60|Dear servant...
60|Even so, I want you to live.
60|I... I beg of you.
60|Please! Please be so kind as to kill me.
60|Please kill me and regain your humanity.
60|Think of it as saving me once again.
60|I'm sorry, Kiss-shot.
60|I can't save you.
60|Your wounds...
60|Huh?
60|They left scars.
60|So about how vampiric is your body now that it's all done?
60|It seems I heal a bit quicker now.
60|When I brush my teeth, I don't think my gums can even bleed.
60|That's boring.
60|That's the sum of it.
60|If I take a positive outlook, I did manage to restore my humanity.
60|However, in exchange for that, there are after-effects.
60|After-effects, eh?
60|Well, if I consider myself as a human now,
60|out here walking under the sun as I am,
60|how I view the world has changed considerably.
60|That's very positive.
60|Heya. You're quite late, Araragi. We were getting impatient.
60|I really am...
60|I'm really sorry.
60|If you ever feel like killing me, you can do so whenever you like.
60|I don't think that's a very righteous outcome, though.
60|You can probably call this human egotism.
60|What you remember of a vampire eating someone,
60|if I had to make a comparison, is like the disillusionment of watching a cute cat devour a live mouse.
60|And here you are, having chosen to keep your own little vampire like a pet.
60|You've dulled its fangs, pulled out its claws,
60|crushed its throat and neutered it,
60|right?
60|You, who was once treated as a pet, are getting back at your former master by treating her as one.
60|When you think about it like that, it's not a very moving tale, is it?
60|But still, I'll be here to help if the need arises.
60|If you ever grow tired of your current state, come let me know at any time.
60|There's no way I'll grow tired of it.
60|I'm doing it because it pleases me, after all.
60|Then why don't you just do as you please?
60|We, who hurt each other so terribly, will sit here licking each other's wounds.
60|We damaged goods will each seek the other out in comfort.
60|If you are to die tomorrow, I'm fine with my life ending then as well.
60|But if you want to live for me for one more day, I'll go on living with you today as well.
60|And thus begins a tale of kindred bound by their scars.
60|Soaked in red and written in black,
60|a story of blood.
60|One of which I'll never speak.
60|Our very own, precious as it is, story of scars.
60|And I have no intention
60|of reciting it to anyone.
60|A star, and you
60|And you, and me
60|The world is beautiful
60|And you are my world
60|A star, and you
60|And you, and me
60|All that I see
60|And all that I feel
60|You are my universe
60|I want to hear you call my name
60|I want to feel your presence in my arms
60|And for this love to last for eternity
60|A star, and you
60|And you, and me
60|You are my universe
60|I want to hear you call my name
60|I want to feel your presence in my arms
60|Yes, this love will last for eternity
60|A star, and you
60|And you, and me
60|You are my universe
60|Étoile, et toi
60|Et toi, et moi
60|Le monde est beau
60|Vous êtes le monde
60|Étoile, et toi
60|Et toi, et moi
60|Tout ce que je vois
60|Tout ce que je ressens
60|Tu es mon univers
60|Je veux vous entendre appeler mon nom
60|Je peux te sentir dans mes bras
60|Et c'est l'amour qui va durer pour toujours
60|Étoile, et toi
60|Et toi, et moi
60|Tu es mon univers
60|Je veux vous entendre appeler mon nom
60|Je peux te sentir dans mes bras
60|Oui c'est l'amour qui va durer pour toujours
60|Étoile, et toi
60|Et toi, et moi
60|Tu es mon univers
61|5. Sin
61|7. Hypocrisy
61|April 6th
61|Is that...
61|Yep, you guessed it.
61|Both of Heart-Under-Blade's arms are in there.
61|I see.
61|Hm?
61|Ah, I know what you want to say.
61|"That Guillotinecutter actually kept his promise?"
61|He must hold quite the grudge,
61|that's for sure.
61|'Cause unlike the other two, Guillotinecutter was driven by faith.
61|Anyways, this means you've collected all four limbs.
61|Congrats, Araragi-kun.
61|Hey, hey, Araragi-kun.
61|I'm congratulating you,
61|so why the gloomy face?
61|You should be happy that you accomplished your goal.
61|Instead, you have the aura of someone at a funeral.
61|I have a question, Oshino.
61|Guillotinecutter, as well as Dramaturgy and Episode...
61|They stole Kiss-Shot's arms, right leg, and left leg, respectively.
61|Strangely, even though I've only fought with my sisters,
61|I beat them all easily.
61|What the hell is going on?
61|Were those guys weak? Or was I...
61|too strong?
61|Why not both?
61|From their point of view, you were too strong.
61|And from your point of view, they were too weak.
61|After all, you're none other than
61|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade's servant.
61|Is that the only reason—
61|That's the only reason.
61|I'm telling you, something's off!
61|If I use that line of reasoning, the story gets weird.
61|As a servant I got this far.
61|Destruction
61|For a full-powered Kiss-Shot,
61|even a 1-on-3 battle should've been no contest.
61|Destruction
61|So if Heart-Under-Blade wasn't at full power back then,
61|it'd be a different story?
61|Well, I was planning to hand it over whether or not you asked.
61|But since you asked, you saved me some time, Araragi-kun.
61|You can be quite perceptive sometimes.
61|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade's heart.
61|Without that heart, she fought the vampire slayers.
61|No wonder she got four limbs torn off.
61|She... never noticed.
61|I know, right?
61|She thought only her arms and legs were stolen.
61|I see. Is that so?
61|I knew Guillotinecutter was a cunning bastard,
61|but to stealthily steal even Kiss-Shot's heart—
61|Oh no, Araragi-kun.
61|Guillotinecutter wasn't the one who stole that heart.
61|Then who did?
61|Me.
61|Without being noticed, I stealthily extracted her heart.
61|You're... capable of something like that?
61|I am.
61|So then, retrieving just her limbs
61|wasn't enough to restore Kiss-Shot to full power?
61|That's right.
61|You should have been forced to take the heart from me.
61|A fourth battle between me and you...
61|With that, there would've been a balance.
61|A battle... with you?
61|"Should have," I said.
61|That's no longer my intention.
61|Look, didn't I already give it back?
61|Sorry about what happened with Class Rep-chan.
61|It's rare for an ordinary person to be so entangled
61|in a case like this.
61|Normally, people run away from oddities.
61|That girl is a bit abnormal.
61|With this, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade's stolen parts
61|have all been retrieved.
61|In other words, you can become human again.
61|Congratulations once again.
61|You should be happy.
61|Ah, one more thing.
61|Out of curiosity...
61|Have you not felt hungry lately?
61|No, I don't think so.
61|Since I gained vampiric immortality,
61|I've lost my appetite.
61|Well, I expect you to get hungry real soon.
61|I mean, it's already been two weeks.
61|Haha! Sucks for you.
61|Well then, Araragi-kun.
61|Once you become human,
61|try not to act so rashly again.
61|Those who encounter an oddity once
61|are bound to attract more. Be careful.
61|Hey, don't talk like you're getting ready to leave.
61|I am leaving. My job is done.
61|Though it ended in failure.
61|Anyways, what's done is done, what's over is over.
61|By the way, Araragi-kun.
61|Your debt of 2 million yen and Class Rep-chan's 3 million yen...
61|Consider them paid.
61|Don't look at me like that, there's no catch.
61|It seems like I'm being generous,
61|but as long as there's a balance, I'm happy.
61|Alrighty then, say hi to Class Rep-chan for me.
61|Now what?
61|Kizumonogatari
61|Reiketsu-hen
61|Yyyyyahooooo!
61|Yahoo! I'm back! I'm back!!
61|Kiss-Shot.
61|Looks like Oshino ran off this morning...
61|What of it?
61|Are you mad about the whole heart thing?
61|Worry not, worry not. I forgive him.
61|Actually, it matters not!
61|Uh, Kiss-Shot?
61|Sorry if this is a bad time,
61|but I'd like to be turned back into a human soon.
61|Ah, of course.
61|Rest assured, I shall turn thee back.
61|But before that, servant, shall we have a little talk?
61|Now, what shall we talk about?
61|Didn't you have something in mind?
61|I did not speak accurately.
61|I had no specific topic in mind.
61|Anything will do.
61|Is this necessary for me to become human again?
61|'Tis necessary, for me.
61|Anyways, you've lived for 500 years.
61|You should have plenty of stories.
61|Nothing of note happened.
61|I was constantly fighting to the death with folks like those three.
61|Essentially, it was a boring 500 years.
61|Now, what shall we talk about?
61|Let me see...
61|If I must tell a story, then it would have to be about that man.
61|I told thee that thou art the second servant I have made.
61|Well, this is the tale of the first servant.
61|You mentioned
61|that I was the second in 400 years.
61|And that he resembles me?
61|Why dost thou think so?
61|Uh— Th— That's...
61|All ye have in common is race.
61|An Ancient Tale
61|KIZUMONOGATARI
61|Story: Nisio Isin
61|Art: Ueda Hajime
61|An Ancient Tale
61|KIZUMONOGATARI
61|Story: Nisio Isin
61|Art: Ueda Hajime
61|That man was a warrior.
61|A brilliant warrior worthy of entrusting my back to.
61|You said we're the same race?
61|Indeed, he was Japanese.
61|As I gallivanted across the world in my youth,
61|I met that man in this country.
61|I also learned Japanese then.
61|Although, many words have changed since then.
61|If that's the case,
61|you should've called him for help this time.
61|That is impossible.
61|For he is dead.
61|That too, is an ancient tale.
61|Dost thou recall?
61|I mentioned that I occasionally wield a katana in battle.
61|Huh?
61|That katana is a memento from him.
61|Demon Blade: Kokorowatari.
61|Though forged by a nameless swordsmith,
61|its sharpness is unparalleled.
61|Do not move.
61|Do not move, I have cut thee.
61|H— Huh?
61|Feel any pain?
61|N— No...
61|Indicating that my skills have not dulled.
61|Thou can move now.
61|Thou already healed.
61|Wh— What the...
61|Healed? It's not like my clothes can heal though.
61|Where did you cut?
61|Thy torso, horizontally.
61|As well as something intolerable.
61|Intolerable, you say?!
61|Do not fret about thy clothing.
61|Kokorowatari is genuinely sharp.
61|If cuts are left alone, they close right up.
61|Naturally, 'tis all due to my skill.
61|He left this memento
61|and died.
61|An immortal vampire died, meaning
61|he was done in by vampire slayers?
61|Incorrect.
61|He was not a man who could be killed by others.
61|Then, how?
61|By suicide.
61|"Boredom kills," as the saying goes.
61|In most cases, vampires seek death after 200 years of life.
61|If there were anything different about that man,
61|it would be that he chose death
61|only a few years after becoming a vampire.
61|In that short time, nothing changed his mind.
61|He perished before my very eyes.
61|He threw himself under the sun, as if to taunt me.
61|Henceforth, I never made another servant.
61|Until I met thee.
61|Were you not bored?
61|I was always bored.
61|However, thou never bored me, servant.
61|Thy every action was absurd.
61|Thou are perhaps the first person in history
61|to volunteer his neck to a vampire!
61|Thou even address me as simply "Kiss-Shot."
61|Now then...
61|Is it time I made thee human again?
61|Y— Yeah.
61|Speaking of which, your first servant
61|never asked to be human again?
61|The old me was
61|incapable of turning him back into a human.
61|This time, I shall capitalize on that experience.
61|So, art thou prepared?
61|Oh, I must've laughed way too much,
61|'cause I'm a little hungry.
61|Could I go grab a bite to eat?
61|Hm?
61|Well, I suppose returning to my complete form
61|has made me rather famished...
61|Wilt thou bring some portable food?
61|"Portable food"?
61|Anyways, it's my last night as a vampire,
61|so it feels kinda bittersweet.
61|Is there anything you want to eat?
61|I've neither likes nor dislikes.
61|Therefore, do as thou pleases, my servant.
61|I honor thy desire to be my servant a while longer.
61|I shall prepare on the second floor.
61|Okay!
61|I guess she really is leaving—
61|Well, it was inevitable.
61|For every hello, there's a goodbye.
61|While these two weeks have been a bad memory for Kiss-Shot...
61|Thinking back, it wasn't such a bad spring break for me.
61|It wasn't bad at all.
61|Let's head to the roof and get this farewell party started.
61|Then, I'll give Kiss-Shot a proper goodbye.
61|I'm back!
61|Oh, servant.
61|That was unexpectedly quick.
61|However, did I not tell thee?
61|Show some manners and leave a lady to her meal.
61|This man came whilst I was waiting for thee.
61|As expected, the barrier could not hide my presence at full power.
61|Hm?
61|What is this?
61|Did thou not bring that bespectacled, braided
61|portable food?
61|Curse
61|April 7th
61|I had heard that priests taste unholy...
61|Turns out they taste divine!
61|I've neither likes nor dislikes,
61|but "hunger is the best sauce" is well put indeed.
61|No—
61|Eating humans is... wrong.
61|However, servant...
61|If I do not eat, I will die.
61|She has always eaten.
61|And she will continue to eat.
61|The first servant...
61|Then the second...
61|In 500 years, we weren't the only ones
61|to have our blood sucked.
61|Every single human except us
61|was chopped up
61|and devoured until not a trace remained.
61|They're her source of nutrition when no servant is around.
61|From now on, if Kiss-Shot eats another human,
61|if she has another meal,
61|it will all be my responsibility.
61|If Hanekawa is eaten,
61|if my sisters are eaten,
61|if my parents are eaten,
61|it will all be my fault.
61|My fault for saving her.
61|It's my fault...
61|It's my fault!
61|Stop... it....
61|I hate it.
61|But I...
61|am a vampire.
61|Ah, one more thing.
61|Have you not felt hungry lately?
61|How do I deal with this?!
61|I have to die.
61|Ah, that's right...
61|I wanted to talk to Hanekawa...
61|I deleted her number and email.
61|Right in front of her,
61|in order to hurt her,
61|I deleted them.
61|I told you
61|not to touch people's phones without permission.
61|Delivery: one girl!
61|What is this?
61|Oh no, I've been locked in the storage room.
61|What if Araragi-kun is playing a dirty prank on me?
61|Flashlight, on!
61|Ah! You're sitting there so you can see my panties.
61|Ah. You don't know what kind of man I am.
61|Let's say there's a naked woman in front of me.
61|If she told me not to look,
61|I'm a man who wouldn't!
61|That's normal.
61|No, Hanekawa.
61|You don't know how big of a gentlemen I am!
61|"Gentlemen" is plural.
61|Well, if that's true,
61|then I look forward to it.
61|Look forward to what?
61|Next semester, I'll be able to see your gentle side
61|all the time, right?
61|That's why
61|you can't die.
61|You can't die.
61|If you're thinking of that,
61|it's proof your heart is running away.
61|You are... amazing.
61|You're amazing.
61|Whenever you're in front of me,
61|I'm reminded of how insignificant I am.
61|If I never met you,
61|I might have died much sooner.
61|That's why I'm telling you, you can't die!
61|Listen to what I'm saying.
61|But it's all my fault.
61|My actions are what led to an outcome like this.
61|Back then, when Kiss-Shot took my blood,
61|I never imagined it would lead to this.
61|Because of me, someone died.
61|That's not your fault.
61|Besides, for Heart-Under-Blade-san,
61|that was a completely natural thing to do.
61|The same thing as us eating cows and pigs.
61|Yeah, Kiss-Shot isn't to blame.
61|I'm the one at fault.
61|It's my fault, and mine alone.
61|Could it be?
61|I never considered it.
61|Dramaturgy,
61|Episode,
61|Guillotinecutter...
61|Those three were on the righteous side of humanity.
61|I became an enemy of humanity.
61|Are you giving up on becoming human again?
61|Are you giving up on your humanity?
61|You said you wanted to be human again,
61|and return to reality,
61|didn't you?!
61|There's been a victim.
61|At this point, if I were the only one to get what I wanted,
61|that'd be way too selfish.
61|You say that'd be selfish,
61|but aren't you being selfish right now?
61|Eh?
61|After all, you're just abandoning the mess you made
61|by running away!
61|Your heart is running away,
61|and so is your body!
61|You're wrong.
61|I don't want to run,
61|I want to take responsibility.
61|By putting an end to this immortal life,
61|I can at least atone for my sins.
61|You'd just be committing another sin.
61|Suicide is a sin.
61|Hanekawa...
61|Hanekawa.
61|Yes?
61|Right now, I'm not a human. I'm a vampire.
61|So...
61|I'm not like you. I'm weak.
61|If I don't die now, I'll keep hesitating until
61|I'm overcome by hunger.
61|Hanekawa...
61|Sooner or later, I'll see you as nothing but food.
61|Then eat me.
61|W— Wha— What are you saying?
61|If I couldn't die for someone,
61|I wouldn't call them my friend.
61|I told you, didn't I?
61|If you knew the real me, you'd be disillusioned.
61|What on earth... are you?
61|I believe I'm your friend.
61|Would you normally go this far based on that?
61|I've said this before, but...
61|How can you do so much for someone you just met?
61|If you did this for everyone,
61|you wouldn't have enough bodies to go around.
61|I don't do this for just anyone, though.
61|I'm only doing it because it's you.
61|Basically, if I'm only saving Araragi-kun,
61|having just one body is enough!
61|That's why you can't die.
61|Don't die.
61|She's completely revived.
61|No one can stop Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.
61|She, whom I revived, will continue
61|to eat humans without reserve.
61|Guillotinecutter didn't stand a chance.
61|Dramaturgy and Episode wouldn't even come close.
61|Oshino would have a better chance, but...
61|He won't do anything besides maintain balance.
61|For him, the job involving Kiss-Shot is already over.
61|There's no one left to stop that vampire.
61|Not even you?
61|Can't you stop her?
61|Rather, aren't you the only one who can stop her?
61|As her one and only servant,
61|doesn't that make you the only one who can stop her?
61|On your marks, get set...
61|GO!
61|I will...
61|I will
61|slay Kiss-Shot.
61|Your expression has changed.
61|Don't worry.
61|I will definitely slay her.
61|Rotate
61|Three
61|Two
61|One
61|Of course, I'll be there to help.
61|If there's something I can do, don't hesitate to ask.
61|That's what I say, but don't ask for things like
61|providing ecchi services.
61|Hanekawa.
61|What?
61|Will you let me touch your breasts?
61|Your breasts—
61|I heard you!
61|Um...
61|Why is that necessary?
61|It's extremely necessary.
61|You didn't see it.
61|What the complete Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade looks like.
61|Huh? But...
61|But I've seen her 12- and 17-year-old forms,
61|so I can imagine what she's like at 27 years old...
61|It's beyond your imagination!
61|She has breasts beyond your imagination!
61|Breasts.
61|I'm afraid of losing from being distracted by her breasts.
61|Those breasts will probably jiggle like crazy in battle.
61|So to prepare, I want some experience with female breasts.
61|What a surprisingly stupid reason.
61|You— You get my reasoning?
61|Fine!
61|Eh— Really?!
61|Give me a minute.
61|Araragi-kun.
61|Eh! Wh— What?
61|If you're gonna massage 'em, do it right.
61|R— Right?
61|Massage them for at least sixty seconds.
61|S— Sixty?
61|Don't hold back!
61|Woah!
61|Y— You know what, Hanekawa?
61|Could you turn around?
61|Seeing your face
61|makes it hard...
61|Li— Lift both your arms.
61|Is this radio calisthenics?
61|You— You won't get mad later?
61|Don't worry. I won't get mad.
61|You sure?
61|I'm sure.
61|Then, uh, how do I put this...
61|In case there's ever a trial,
61|could you say, "Araragi-kun, please fondle my braless boobs? I beg you."
61|A— A— Araragi-kun,
61|p— please fondle my braless boobs.
61|I— I beg you.
61|No, it doesn't count if you say it so quietly.
61|That makes it sound like
61|I'm forcing you into it.
61|In a louder voice,
61|tell me how you want me to do it.
61|You have to say it of your own free will.
61|A— Araragi-kun,
61|p— please fondle my braless boobs.
61|I beg you!
61|"To have my breasts fondled by Araragi-kun
61|is such an honor."
61|To have my breasts...
61|fondled by Araragi-kun...
61|i— is such an honor.
61|Let's see.
61|"I grew these slutty boobs just to get fondled by Araragi-kun."
61|I grew these— these slutty boobs
61|ju— just to get fondled by Araragi-kun.
61|Really? You don't look like it,
61|but you're so perverted, Hanekawa.
61|Yes, I am very perverted!
61|I'm sorry!
61|There's no need to apologize.
61|No matter how perverted you are,
61|no one would mind.
61|Is that so?
61|Well then,
61|why exactly are the perverted yet serious
61|Class Rep's boobs so slutty?
61|Their s— size and softness make it so
61|their sluttiness is second to none!
61|Ah, I see.
61|I get it now!
61|My entire life has been leading up to this day!
61|The human named Araragi Koyomi
61|was born solely to experience this day!
61|Actually, it shouldn't be possible to fondle a friend's breasts!
61|I can't! I really can't!
61|Chicken.
61|Chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken chicken—
61|I'm a chicken! And a coward!
61|Please forgive me!
61|I took advantage of Hanekawa-san's kindness, BUT
61|thanks to her voice, I snapped out of it!
61|You think this is over?
61|Do you know how much resolve it took
61|for me to sit here like this?
61|N— No!
61|Someone like me can't even begin to guess—
61|W— Wait, how much resolve did it take?
61|Would you be so kind as to tell me?
61|Honestly, I didn't think you'd stop at a breast massage.
61|"Oh, I see. That's how it is."
61|"My first time will be on a mat in the storage room."
61|Isn't it too early for that resolve?!
61|Well, it happens.
61|Happens, my ass!
61|And yet, after so much teasing,
61|so much humiliation,
61|you didn't even lay a finger on me!
61|Araragi-kun. Am I really that unattractive?
61|H— How 'bout I massage your shoulders instead?
61|Shoulders?
61|Yes, your shoulders.
61|I wish to massage Hanekawa-san's shoulders.
61|That is all.
61|Thank you very much.
61|Satisfied?
61|Y— Yes ma'am.
61|To be continued online.
61|I can't get massaged online.
61|Th— Then, let's continue this next semester?
61|Hm, sounds good.
61|You made a girl do this much.
61|Don't tell me you're going to lose now.
61|Yo.
61|Didn't think you'd do me the favor of coming.
61|Just this once.
61|Servant.
61|As the sun shone, I came to understand thy emotions.
61|I came to understand the reason for thine anger.
61|I did not take into consideration thy former humanity.
61|Thus, just this once, I bow my head to thee.
61|Return under me.
61|Live together with me.
61|My life was saved by thee.
61|Thou may be peculiar,
61|but that is why I believe I may live with thou.
61|Wilt thou not live with me for eternity?
61|I refuse.
61|You eat people.
61|That's reason enough for me.
61|If thou had known that,
61|would thou have not saved me?
61|Would thou have left me to die?
61|I didn't understand a thing.
61|No...
61|That's not right.
61|I knew from the beginning.
61|I merely looked the other way.
61|I made up my mind to die for you.
61|In other words,
61|I tolerated that you ate people.
61|But I never imagined someone would die because of that.
61|My intentions were pure,
61|but not right.
61|'Tis what I thought thou would say.
61|'Tis what I longed to hear.
61|With this, my doubts are cleared, servant.
61|Somehow, I perceived it from the start.
61|That thou wert this kind of person.
61|Hypocrisy
61|Thy kindness
61|would only last whilst I was weak.
61|Aye, I understood that.
61|Hypocrite!
61|I knew that once I was complete, thou would
61|care for me no longer.
61|Hypocrisy
61|Thou did not save me because I was special.
61|Thou would have saved anyone who was weak.
61|Hypocrisy
61|Hypocrite!
61|Waaah
61|Now! Come hither, servant.
61|If thou kill me posthaste,
61|thou can regain thine precious humanity!
61|Kiss-Shot.
61|There's one final thing I want to ask you.
61|Oh? Very well.
61|As a parting gift,
61|I shall answer anything. Ask ahead.
61|What are humans to you?
61|Food.
61|That's also what I wanted to hear you say.
61|Die, my master!
61|Die, my servant!
61|Superb!
61|'Tis the greatest vampire death match ever!
61|More! More, servant!
61|Shall I share something good, servant?
61|Despite it not mattering upon thy parting here?
61|Ah?
61|I too
61|am a former human!
61|A former human.
61|The same as Dramaturgy and thineself.
61|What?
61|You weren't a pure one?!
61|I've almost forgotten all about my days as a human.
61|It seems I was even born to a nice family.
61|Ha! For vampires over 300 years of age,
61|there is no concept of "pure" or "subservient."
61|Does that matter?!
61|Nay, merely something I had long forgotten.
61|I recalled as we talked yesternight.
61|Come to think of it, I too
61|felt rather reluctant
61|to eat humans at first!
61|Then—!
61|Even thou—
61|If thou ate just one human,
61|thou would lose all feelings of guilt.
61|Kiss-Shot...
61|I'm a human.
61|I see.
61|I am a vampire.
61|Finally, it's time for Team Japan to take the stage.
61|They have faced great challenges on the path to glory.
61|Now, these Japanese youth walk forth with pride.
61|As you recall, Tokyo was set to host the 1940 Olympics, but
61|the ensuing conflict swept that dream aside.
61|Hold it!
61|Five years ago, the qualifiers were held in Tokyo.
61|These past five years, the efforts of each and every Japanese citizen have—
61|Araragi-kun!
61|Something's off—
61|Hanekawa! That's enough, go hide!
61|W— Wait, something's been off for a while!
61|There's something important that we're overlook—
61|Silence!
61|Do— Do not spout unnecessary words, portable food!
61|Heart-Under-Blade-san,
61|could it be that you—
61|Insolent human!
61|Do not interfere!
61|What is it, servant?
61|Half my blood remains untouched.
61|While I may be immobilized now from blood loss,
61|if thou dost not end me quickly, I shall recover.
61|How exactly were you going to make me human again?
61|Does that even matter to thee anymore?
61|Heart-Under-Blade-san.
61|Were you...
61|planning to be killed by Araragi-kun from the start?
61|In order to make him human again.
61|Do not spout such nonsense, portable food.
61|What evidence dost thou—
61|Then how exactly were you planning to make him human?
61|Please explain.
61|Thou already know.
61|I simply had no intention of ever turning him back.
61|I lied to have him gather my limbs.
61|You're wrong.
61|You had him gather your parts
61|because if he killed you in an incomplete form,
61|then he wouldn't turn back into a human.
61|It'd be meaningless unless he killed a complete you.
61|You... intended to die.
61|What did thou hope to gain from saying that?
61|Dost thou believe
61|this servant can kill me after hearing that?
61|Wh— Why?
61|Why did you... do such a—
61|I was searching for a place to die.
61|I'd be better off dead.
61|Or so I thought.
61|But alas, I grew fearful of death.
61|I was afraid to disappear after living for 500 years.
61|The prospect of no longer existing
61|was both terrifying and unsettling.
61|For the first time in my life, I was helped by another.
61|Not a single human nor vampire
61|had ever helped me like that.
61|As I sucked thy blood,
61|I began to question my actions.
61|That is why
61|I shall die for thy sake.
61|I could not die for him.
61|I was unable to die.
61|I was unable to make him human again.
61|Thus...
61|What is the matter?
61|Art thou crying?
61|Such a crybaby, my servant is.
61|Pitiful.
61|No, these aren't tears...
61|This is... This is...
61|Blood. My blood is flowing.
61|Isn't blood
61|flowing within you too?!
61|My word. How unnecessary thy actions were,
61|portable food.
61|I was to lower my guard and be killed at a suitable time.
61|But, this is fine.
61|Because thou
61|have no choice left but to take my life.
61|If thou dost not kill me,
61|starting tomorrow, I shall eat 1000 humans a day.
61|Saying that should
61|force thou to kill me, no?
61|To prove I am serious,
61|if I claim that portable food as my first victim,
61|would thou act then?
61|Thou ought to end the very life thou saved.
61|Is that not thine responsibility?
61|Kiss-Shot!
61|Thou art the second to call me by that name.
61|And thou shall be the last.
61|Now, kill me, servant.
61|Now. Now. Now. Now. Now.
61|Now. Now. Now. Now.
61|Now,
61|Now. Now. Now. NOW.
61|FUCK!
61|Oshinooo!
61|Oshino Memeee!
61|I know you're watching from somewhere!
61|Stop fucking around and get your ass over here!
61|I understand everything you told me!
61|I don't need any explanations!
61|Just get over here!
61|I know exactly what I did!
61|So get your ass over here,
61|Oshino Meme!
61|No need to shout, I can hear you.
61|Araragi-kun, meeting you here is quite
61|unprecedented.
61|Oshino.
61|Haha! My, how energetic you are, Araragi-kun.
61|Did something good happen?
61|I have a job for you.
61|Do something.
61|"Something"?
61|That's vague.
61|I'll pay up.
61|It's not a problem of money.
61|Then what's the problem?!
61|It's your own problem.
61|Don't push it.
61|Yo, Class Rep-chan.
61|Nice to meet you, yeah?
61|Nice to meet you, I'm Hanekawa.
61|Brat. Do not interfere.
61|We had an agreement.
61|I don't recall agreeing to anything with you,
61|Heart-Under-Blade.
61|I just do as I please, collecting information.
61|Your decision to make Araragi human again
61|through your own death
61|was awfully convenient for me.
61|So, what now?
61|Don't you have a job for me as a specialist?
61|As for the fee, let's see...
61|How 'bout the 5 million yen I considered paid?
61|So, what is your wish?
61|Tell me a way to make everyone happy.
61|A way to end things with no one unhappy.
61|That doesn't exist.
61|Are you stupid?
61|However, there's a way to make everyone unhappy.
61|What I mean is, the total amount of unhappiness here
61|will be evenly distributed.
61|Nobody's wish will come true,
61|but if that's fine, there is a way.
61|To be specific, well,
61|Araragi-kun has to almost kill Kiss-Shot.
61|Suck away almost all of her vampiric traits and skills,
61|but don't kill her.
61|Heart-Under-Blade will be closer to death than ever before.
61|She'll lose her shadow, her form,
61|and even her name and age.
61|She'll be a pseudo-vampire human-like entity,
61|unable to eat humans no matter how hungry she gets.
61|As for Araragi-kun,
61|you won't be human again, but something close.
61|Araragi-kun will be a pseudo-human vampire-like entity.
61|We can't exactly call you human,
61|but you'll be far from a vampire.
61|A half-assed kind of entity.
61|How fitting.
61|However, as a result,
61|Araragi-kun may cause Heart-Under-Blade
61|to starve to death from malnutrition.
61|Heart-Under-Blade's one and only source of nutrition,
61|once degraded to that state,
61|will be your blood.
61|You must devote the rest of your life to her,
61|and she must stay close to you for the rest of hers.
61|In other words, we humans...
61|Yep.
61|Must quit hunting these dangerous vampires.
61|Ultimately, a risk remains.
61|If Heart-Under-Blade and Araragi-kun become vampires again,
61|they could start eating humans.
61|We can't ignore that possibility.
61|Surely you jest, brat!
61|I— I cannot even consider living
61|under such conditions!
61|I shall die—
61|Allow me to die for his sake!
61|Kill me! Kill me! Kill me now!
61|I do not wish to live!
61|Like I said, you'll be unhappy.
61|Your wish won't come true.
61|Though that's Araragi-kun's decision to make.
61|Servant!
61|Servant...
61|Even so,
61|I want you to live.
61|P— Please... I beseech thee...
61|Somehow...
61|Somehow kill me, please.
61|Please kill me and become human again...
61|Think of it as saving me.
61|Forgive me, Kiss-Shot.
61|I won't save you.
61|April 8th
61|Wound.
61|Huh?
61|There's a wound.
61|In the end, how much vampirism was left in your body?
61|Well, my healing speed is pretty high.
61|My gums don't bleed when I brush my teeth.
61|So plain...
61|That's about it.
61|On the bright side,
61|I did become human again,
61|just with some residual effects.
61|Residual effects, huh.
61|Now that I'm a human,
61|simply being out here in the sun
61|makes me feel like the world has changed.
61|Optimistic, aren't you?
61|You're late, Araragi-kun. I almost fell asleep.
61|I'm really...
61|really sorry.
61|If you want to kill me,
61|kill me anytime.
61|I still don't think that was the right thing to do.
61|I'd call it "human egotism."
61|What you felt toward vampires eating humans
61|was the disillusionment of seeing a cute kitty devour a mouse.
61|Speaking of pets, you chose to keep a vampire as one.
61|You removed her fangs, plucked her nails,
61|crushed her throat, neutered her...
61|You, a former pet,
61|now treat your master like a pet.
61|If you think about it, it's not exactly a moving tale...
61|Anyhow, I'll lend a hand if the need arises.
61|Whenever you get sick of this,
61|come let me know, Araragi-kun.
61|I'll never get sick of it.
61|I do it 'cause I like it.
61|Then, do as you like.
61|We, who wounded each other,
61|now lick each other's wounds.
61|We, who were wounded,
61|now need each other to heal.
61|If tomorrow you die,
61|tomorrow my life will end.
61|If today you live,
61|then today I too will live on.
61|Thus, a tale of the wounded begins.
61|Red when wet, black when dry.
61|A tale of blood.
61|A tale of our precious wounds that will never disappear.
61|I will not tell it to anyone.

62|my love softly blossomed
62|like a flower for the first time
62|I'm sure you don't realize it
62|You held out your hand to me
62|and although I found no strength to take it
62|I want you to hold it out to me
62|for just a while longer
62|That is my ray of light in the darkness
62|I don't want to know the future
62|of my love just yet

62|Yeah, a stone.
62|What about it?
62|Well...
62|I guess it could also be a stone statue.
62|A stone statue?
62|I mean, it's not a stone statue, but...
62|I was just thinking that Oshino might want to know about it since he collects stories like this.
62|Stories like what?
62|Urban legends, gossip, idle rumors, and hearsay.
62|I thought the Seven Wonders of the School would fit right in.
62|Seven Wonders?
62|We don't have any stories of students meeting an untimely death inside the school.
62|Um... What are we talking about here?
62|I'm sorry, Hanekawa.
62|You left out one too many details.
62|I totally lost track.
62|Uh, like I said,
62|it's a ghost story about a stone.
62|Now I see.
62|It's hard to say one way or the other if this is a stone or a statue.
62|Is this the stone you were referring to?
62|Yup.
62|Oshino helped us a lot over spring break, right?
62|I figured we could tell him if something ghostly happened at our school.
62|As a way to repay him.
62|I see.
62|The school doesn't really have a long history,
62|so we don't really have any ghost stories as of yet.
62|There's just one thing that's been bugging me.
62|This stone?
62|Or stone statue... Or something...
62|Yes, exactly.
62|You know, it used to look different.
62|I probed around the school grounds when I first came here.
62|Why did you do that?
62|Wouldn't you want to know more about
62|the kind of place you'd be spending the next three years?
62|So, basically what you're saying is that two years ago when you looked around,
62|this flowerbed didn't have the stone in it, right?
62|No, no. The stone was here.
62|So what's the problem?
62|I told you, it used to look different.
62|The stone was here, but the shrine wasn't.
62|The platform wasn't here either, nor the offerings.
62|In the two intervening years,
62|someone propped the stone up like a statue
62|and began to worship it.
62|There you have it.
62|We figured you'd be interested in hearing it.
62|Hanekawa wants to thank you for what you did for us.
62|It's hard to call this a story about oddities,
62|but it is interesting.
62|I'll write it down.
62|So what do you say, Oshino?
62|Two years ago it was apparently just a stone.
62|Now, two years later, it is the object of religious worship for an unknown section of the student body.
62|Do you think it's an oddity or something similar?
62|Physical objects turning into oddities isn't so rare.
62|Is it being worshipped because it's an oddity?
62|Did it become an oddity from the worship?
62|I can't decide.
62|Is it worshipped because it's an oddity
62|or is it an oddity because it's worshipped?
62|No, no.
62|The question isn't whether it's an oddity because it's being worshipped.
62|It's whether it's being worshipped because it's an oddity,
62|or whether it became an oddity because it was being worshipped.
62|Well, I admit the tenses aren't the same, but I don't really see a difference.
62|In this case, perhaps.
62|It's kind of hard to tell just from your narration.
62|Can you draw a picture for me, Araragi?
62|I don't really have a talent for drawing.
62|Perhaps you're surprised by that.
62|A sketch is fine.
62|All right.
62|Black
62|So the shrine looks like this.
62|To me, the altar just seemed like a place to put the offerings,
62|but when I looked at the shrine itself it seemed like it was clumsily imitating something.
62|Maybe I saw something like it at a temple somewhere,
62|or some wayside statues.
62|I don't know.
62|I feel like I've seen its shape before.
62|That's the kind of nugget of wisdom I need to know first.
62|Did you save it for last to trump up your erudition?
62|No, it was just a vague feeling and only putting it on paper helped me get the words out.
62|I don't really remember anything concrete.
62|I kind of feel like I've seen it somewhere before...
62|That something central about it isn't new to me.
62|Do you know what it is, Oshino?
62|No, can't say I do.
62|However...
62|However what?
62|Don't just stop.
62|Tell me if you figured something out.
62|You seem lively today, Araragi.
62|Did something nice happen to you?
62|All right, Araragi.
62|Tell the prez this.
62|It should be enough that she can understand.
62|You can ignore the ghost stories for the moment.
62|Try looking into Naoetsu High School's curriculum.
62|Studying is what students should really be doing.
62|What's going on?
62|Oh, I was just unnecessarily anxious.
62|Hanekawa, please try!
62|You should be able to explain this in a way that I can understand.
62|Please try, huh?
62|Black
62|Think about the curriculum we have at this school.
62|Remember how we could choose between art classes in our first year?
62|I picked fine arts, but there was calligraphy and woodworking too, right?
62|When Oshino suggested we look at the curriculum, that was what he was hinting at.
62|You mean woodworking?
62|If I remember correctly,
62|the people in woodworking had to make a small house of wood.
62|Basically, one of the little wooden houses got turned into the shrine we saw.
62|Judging from how it looks, it was probably a failed attempt.
62|This is what I think happened.
62|One of the students was making a little house in woodworking and it went awry.
62|But since he made it in class, the teacher told him to take it home anyway.
62|Since he'd only throw it away at home anyway,
62|he decided to sneak it into the school's garbage.
62|On his way there he walked past the flowerbed.
62|It makes sense.
62|The trash is very close to the flowerbed.
62|He walks past and sees the stone.
62|He looks at it and figures, well, this wouldn't look so bad with a stone inside.
62|The stone doesn't look like a statue because of the shrine around it.
62|The wooden junk looks like a shrine because there's a stone in it.
62|Both stop failing as their own objects.
62|The other way around.
62|It's the other way around.
62|It's still a pretty childish thing.
62|The student probably went home after he saw his failure transformed
62|from something bound for the trash into a little shrine, a house, basically.
62|And so produced a stone statue that seemed like it was the object of worship.
62|And now I can relax.
62|Thanks, Araragi.
62|Why would you thank me?
62|You told Oshino that the shrine reminded you of something.
62|I bet that was when he realized it too.
62|It isn't imitating something that you saw.
62|You once made the same thing in class, right?
62|I bet you took woodworking instead of fine arts.
62|Yeah. Right.
62|You're right.
62|Case closed, then.
62|Black
62|Hey, don't run in the hallway!
62|And now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
62|Black
62|Obviously it was I who made this in woodworking two years ago,
62|didn't take it home with me, but left it in the flowerbed.
62|I understood the reason for Oshino's odd smile.
62|I'm sure he was desperately suppressing his laughter.
62|Is it being worshipped because it's an oddity?
62|Did it become an oddity from being worshipped?
62|Those were Oshino's words.
62|They were cheap sweets, but this stone came a long way.
62|There is no disputing that,
62|and perhaps my thoughtless actions turned this stone into an oddity.
62|Perhaps it turned from a normal stone into the stone statue I needed,
62|and from there into an abnormal oddity.
62|The normal becomes the abnormal.
62|Perhaps that is what happened.
62|In light of that, going to school without direction can have real consequences.
62|I decided to go back to the classroom and ask Hanekawa
62|whether being unable to appreciate normality meant that I was like stones and wood.
62|This stone...
62|is just concrete.
62|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
62|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
62|We were happy children full of curiosity,
62|I was the one who pushed you forward,
62|from that day onward.
62|Let's escape our confines
62|and take our time along the way
62|Let's ride our bikes to far away
62|carrying our hopes and dreams in the basket
62|Is the future we heard so many rumors about,
62|a nice place to be?
62|Even if we ask our extending shadows about it,
62|we'll still be none the wiser
63|We can still make it if we act now
63|It'd be better if we retreated
63|Before we get into more misunderstandings.
63|The staples of my words that bound you
63|Somewhere along the way
63|Began to stab into my heart
63|It hurts
63|You're to blame
63|Don’t come near
63|to someone…to someone like me…
63|Don’t look
63|at such…at such a place…
63|Don't talk
63|with that, the kind of smile
63|you make to just anybody.
63|We'll continue on anywhere.
63|Just like the sky,
63|promise me it will be
63|an eternity without end.
63|You're cruel and gentle,
63|just like the ocean,
63|if I jump into your heart,
63|accept me completely.
63|These heavy feelings
63|that cannot be weighed,
63|I convey them now,
63|only to you.

63|It was Tuesday evening.
63|Alongside Senjougahara, I was on the way home from the abandoned cram school.
63|She had suffered,
63|She had lived her life fighting against illness,
63|and then yesterday
63|the time of fighting that illness had come to an end.
63|Comparing this with being ill,
63|I can understand the value of good health,
63|but as someone who has been ill for such a long period of time
63|'just walking’ like this
63|feels like something new to me.
63|Is that so?
63|So then, what should I do about this?
63|About what?
63|Because of this case, I was charged a fee from Oshino, right?
63|Do you have any savings or anything?
63|I do not. I do have debts, though.
63|Senjougahara. Do you happen to know any oddities?
63|Oshino, as a specialist, is a collector of oddity stories, you see.
63|If you happen to know of
63|a weird oddity story,
63|or a rare urban legend,
63|or something, then it’s possible he might lower your debt, I thought.
63|But unfortunately, I don’t happen to know any stories
63|about oddities above the one I experienced personally.
63|Hold on.
63|What is it?
63|Eh?
63|Don’t just touch me so casually.
63|Ah, sorry.
63|It’s just that, you suddenly seemed like you were about to jump out onto the road.
63|I wasn't trying to jump out.
63|I just thought I’d try to get a closer look at that.
63|Huh?
63|It seems a traffic accident occurred around here.
63|Looks like it.
63|I wonder if it was recent?
63|But if you got into an accident because the flowers caught your attention
63|then the person they were meant for wouldn't be able to rest.
63|Be careful.
63|I’ve just remembered.
63|What do you mean when you say you’ve remembered?
63|A 'scary story', Araragi.
63|What?
63|Black
63|This is an order from your princess. Do as you see fit.
63|What kind of princess has that tone of voice?
63|M
63|a

63|th
63|In accordance with Princess Senjougahara’s decree,
63|I went to the rooftop of one of Naoetsu High’s buildings.
63|It’s true.
63|It’s just as Senjougahara said.
63|Near the fence on the rooftop,
63|was a bouquet of flowers wrapped in a vinyl sheet.
63|How did you get onto the rooftop anyway?
63|I may not be Hanekawa, but I happen to be an honors student as well.
63|I’m capable of borrowing the key by going to the teacher with an excuse.
63|So why did you go up onto the rooftop?
63|When I entered Naoetsu High, I had to look into safe places.
63|Her wariness towards other people was strong.
63|In a different way from how Hanekawa looked into Naoetsu High when she took the exams,
63|she must have investigated to see what was dangerous and what was safe,
63|who was a friend and who was an enemy.
63|And there was a bouquet of flowers on the restricted-access rooftop.
63|It’s different from oddity stories or even ghost stories.
63|but,
63|if you think about it,
63|Black
63|it’s still a mysterious story, right?
63|Yes. It was a mysterious story indeed.
63|In the eighteen years of Naoetsu High history that held
63|there wasn’t even one incident in which a student had died.
63|... well, at any rate
63|How am I going to get back inside the building…
63|So, how about it, Oshino?
63|The story I brought just now,
63|is it worth a hundred thousand yen?
63|What is it?
63|Araragi, do you happen to know the young lady’s phone number or email address?
63|No, I don’t.
63|Well, I wanted to tell her this;
63|‘It didn’t meet my expectations, so please take out a loan for the fee.'
63|Could you at least to tell me why it isn't even worth a single yen?
63|First of all, in terms of that traffic accident location that you guys saw;
63|last month, an accident did happen.
63|Is that so?
63|It seems that place has a road structure in which accidents occur rather easily.
63|Well, even Senjougahara looked like she was about to jump out into the road.
63|But in Senjougahara’s case it was because she had noticed a flower offering, I guess.
63|So it’s not really a problem of road structure.
63|So the problem is,
63|'There are no cases of anybody jumping off the school building to commit suicide,
63|or even cases of falling by accident.
63|So why is there a bouquet of flowers left on every roof of your school?' Is that right?
63|Yeah, that’s right.
63|Well, whether or not it was an accident,
63|the rooftop is certainly a place where it’s easy to fall from.
63|That’s why entry was prohibited.
63|Well, schools with accessible rooftops usually
63|have them surrounded by tall fences or something.
63|Right
63|Well, whether they're on a road or in a school,
63|there are places where accidents and incidents are likely to occur.
63|To put it simply,
63|they're like the oposite of power spots, I guess?
63|So, places that are bad spiritually?
63|I guess there are things like that.
63|Like how the northeast direction is the unlucky 'demon's gate’
63|No, that's a different sort of thing.
63|In terms of places where it’s easy for accidents to occur,
63|there’s one in every part of the country.
63|Also for those wishing to commit suicide, there are places that people are likely to choose.
63|Although ultimately those are problems with the geography of the environment,
63|and there’s no spiritual component to it.
63|Even Senjougahara almost jumping out wasn't caused
63|by an oddity or a spirit or anything
63|and was just a problem with the angle of the bouquet, wasn’t it?
63|That’s right. That’s why I planned on changing the placement of the bouquet.
63|Araragi, the bouquet of flowers offered could be asking for accidents to happen.
63|But don’t you think the reverse could be true?
63|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
63|Though I say 'now', the punch line occurred quite a while later.
63|That is because I came to an ‘understanding’ with Oshino’s story
63|and didn't report back to Senjougahara in the end.
63|When I finally remembered, it was near the end of May.
63|Black
63|I've just remembered.
63|Long story short, they're like a piece of the puzzle
63|in the school's rooftop control,
63|those bouquets.
63|Rooftop control?
63|Yeah, like setting locks, or putting up fences.
63|Well, if you compare them,
63|the bouquets are more of a consolation, or a good-luck charm,
63|or maybe something like a jinx.
63|What kind of control do you get from putting bouquets on rooftops?
63|Like some sort of tasteless conspiracy.
63|But by placing a bouquet that makes it seem like it’s saying 'somebody died here’,
63|it’s paradoxically acting as a warning that says 'this place is dangerous’.
63|Acting as a warning?
63|Something like, 'frequent accidents ahead’?
63|There must’ve been someone who thought just saying
63|it was 'dangerous' would be too commonplace and wouldn’t have enough effect.
63|But if there was a stronger message, like 'someone died here in the past’
63|But, could there be any effect other than a jinx?
63|Well, rather than a consolation, Oshino said it was more a playful thing,
63|since the locked door and the fences would normally be enough.
63|It’s just that it’s not completely perfect,
63|After all, there are actually students like you that lie in order to get onto the rooftop.
63|Wait a second, Araragi. Could you not talk about people as if they were liars?
63|Black
63|I just happen to be honey-mouthed.
63|Poison-mouthed, more like!
63|Tasty poison is the worst kind, right?
63|So, knowing that the control wasn’t perfect,
63|the school placed that good-luck charm, that consolation, there.
63|I see.
63|But how was Oshino,
63|from your story alone,
63|able to come to that conclusion?
63|It’s not really a conclusion he came to.
63|You see, both of us were misunderstanding in the same way.
63|Whether it’s suicide or an accident,
63|if someone had fallen from the rooftop
63|then you wouldn’t normally put flowers on the roof, right?
63|You’d put them on the ground where they fell.
63|I see. That was a misunderstanding, wasn’t it?
63|But it’s a mistake anyone could make, isn’t it?
63|You’re quick to cover for yourself.
63|Well, if the other party was aware of that discrepancy
63|they’d know that the flowers have no extra meaning to them.
63|However,
63|there won't be any need to place flowers anymore.
63|Yes. The fact that improvements on the rooftop had started
63|was what caused me to remember this case.
63|The reason why such improvements on the rooftop became necessary was because
63|rumors like, “The other day there was a student
63|who got to the roof from the outside.”
63|began to spread.
63|The school probably hadn’t imagined the existence of someone
63|stupid enough to climb the rooftop from the outside.
63|With the cost of the new fence.
63|And if it was revealed that the true identity of that trespasser was me,
63|I wouldn’t be excused by just dropping out of school.
63|Of course, Senjougahara, who had suggested it,
63|would also be in danger.
63|Araragi.
63|Understood. This’ll be a secret between the two of us.
63|No. Becoming a secret is not enough, I think.
63|What do you want me to do if it’s not enough?
63|Carry on as before, of course.
63|As before?
63|Black
63|Let’s forget about it.
63|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
63|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
63|We were happy children full of curiosity,
63|I was the one who pushed you forward,

63|Even if we ask our extending shadows about it,
63|we'll still be none the wiser
64|Turn right here,
64|then take the next left
64|nothing's working out. I'm so troubled!
64|Right, left, reft, light,
64|Don't let your limbs outside the bus window!
64|Left there, then immediately take the right,
64|It doesn't matter which you take, the result will be the same.
64|Sunny but cloudy later in the day,
64|Partly rainy in some places, it's like this, right?
64|After I keep taking detours, before I knew it,
64|it's already the end of the day, with the end of the year coming.
64|I'm all out of options to take!
64|Since my stomach is empty I'm going back,
64|going back straight to my home.
64|When my heart wanders,
64|that smile is the guide.
64|Take hand in hand and go home.
64|Let's go home together.
64|Always being there,
64|you always find me.
64|Even though it's a roundabout route,
64|it isn't a roundabout route!

64|Hello, Mr Tirey Tirey
64|Mr Tirey Tirey
64|Wait a minute, Hachikuji.
64|Don’t call out to me with such weariness
64|that makes it seem like you're fed up with talking to me.
64|My name is Araragi.
64|Sorry I bit my tongue.
64|No, it was on purpose.
64|I fumble-stumbled!
64|It wasn’t on purpose?!
64|Araragi, where are you headed to today?
64|As you can see, I’m off to school now.
64|Didn't I tell you the other day?
64|I’ve changed jobs from a stupid delinquent into a student sincere about his work.
64|And so, I’m going to school.
64|Although even insincere students go to school.
64|Hey, Hachikuji.
64|There’s something that I need to tell you.
64|What is it?
64|Oshino, Oshino Meme...
64|That old specialist guy that helped you out,
64|he left town.
64|Well, that was quite sudden, wasn’t it?
64|Since you’ve never met him directly, this might not be of any concern to you...
64|though you aren't indifferent to it, I thought I should tell you just in case.
64|But, Araragi. What happens with that case, then?
64|That case? What case?
64|Like I said, it's this, you see, this.
64|Then perhaps it might be better if I said this, Araragi,
64|your failure to pay the 5 million yen was very well done.
64|I didn’t fail to pay it!
64|Look, Hachikuji. I’m the kind of guy that returns money he borrows.
64|I’ve properly repaid my debt to Oshino.
64|With that over with, I’m completely debt-free and clean.
64|Is that so?
64|I'm a little disappointed by that.
64|Why?
64|Didn’t I tell you the other day?
64|The other day?
64|When you were being stalked by that very fast junior of yours.
64|You were asking me, 'I owe a huge amount of money to Oshino
64|and what should I do?' or something like that.
64|Didn’t you say something like, even if you didn’t have any hard cash,
64|if there was an unusual story about an oddity, you’d be able to turn it into cash, right?
64|Did I say all that?
64|So anyway, Araragi.
64|Since then, I was wondering if I could be of any help to Araragi,
64|so during my walks, I’ve been looking for stories,
64|like those 'Oddity stories’ and even 'Ghost stories’.
64|Were you really doing that for me?
64|Now my scheme to sell the story I managed to find to Araragi for a high price is ruined.
64|Scheme?! High price?!
64|Eh, you weren’t going to give it to me?!
64|I wasn’t.
64|Araragi. Now that it’s gone this way, I won’t go as high as five million yen. So please buy it.
64|It’ll be a bargain.
64|Incidentally, how much were you aiming to sell it for, Hachikuji?
64|Around fifty yen is fine.
64|That’s cheap!
64|Well, you see, this story was worth only that much to start with.
64|Were you planning on selling a story worth only fifty yen
64|to your friend for five million yen?!
64|So, what kind of a story is it? Tell me.
64|Yes, well. So it’s a story about sand.
64|Sand?
64|How should I put it?
64|It looked like the expression of a demon.
64|A bloodcurdling drawing.
64|As if the sand itself was almost like an oddity.
64|Because Hachikuji was going around looking
64|for some strange or suspicious phenomenon to try and sell to me
64|it's possible she might have seen the originally normal sandbox
64|as something more mysterious.
64|However, was it also possible to see the same 'demon expression’ on different days?
64|In other words, no matter how it was changed or mixed around, the sand in this sandbox
64|always returned to a demon’s shape.
64|Recurring bizarreness.
64|As if the sand had a will of its own.
64|Well, thinking about it normally, it has to be just somebody playing around.
64|This is just regular sand.
64|Maybe if I played in the same way a kid would play in this sandbox,
64|there would be some kind of response.
64|Whether it’s a prank, it might not be something as impressive.
64|Either way, it doesn’t seem like there’s any need for me to get involved.
64|If it’s an oddity, it’s not going to show itself so easily.
64|But it could also be the work of a human.
64|Hanekawa Tsubasa
64|Hands Free
64|Araragi?
64|There's something I am curious about. Is now a good time?
64|It’s all right.
64|Hanekawa Tsubasa
64|Hands Free
64|A little while ago, Senjougahara
64|gave me her periodical report.
64|Periodical report?! What do you mean?!
64|So during that time, I just happened to hear about it.
64|Araragi, I heard that after Senjougahara's study session,
64|you were going to investigate some sand in a park.
64|Are you done with that already?
64|I thought I’d try and time it so I'd call you once you were done.
64|Bad!
64|Isn’t this a bit hopeless, Araragi?
64|I had hoped that you would have resolved everything neatly.
64|I was planning more of a follow-up report.
64|Investigative
64|report
64|Follow-up
64|A follow-up report...
64|Araragi, you’ve forgotten something important.
64|You’re just looking at it too rigidly.
64|Rigidly?
64|Saying whether the sandbox is either the work of an oddity, or an artificial phenomenon
64|and that it has to be one of the two is too rigid. Isn’t it?
64|Well, I suppose it is.
64|Are there other possibilities?
64|Hanekawa Tsubasa
64|Hands Free
64|There are other possibilities. A third possibility.
64|Huh, so there is something like that?
64|You really know everything, don’t you?
64|I don’t know everything.
64|I just know what I know.
64|The third option.
64|If it’s neither the work of an oddity nor a human act, then it would be...
64|Oddity
64|Human
64|Well, thinking about it properly, using the process of elimination,
64|then the only thing I can think of is it being a natural phenomenon.
64|Hanekawa Tsubasa
64|Hands Free
64|That’s right, so you do understand, Araragi!
64|But, a natural phenomenon?
64|There's no way that's -
64|Listen Araragi. 'Natural phenomena' isn't limited to wind and rain, you know?
64|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
64|Hey, Araragi.
64|When you investigated the sandbox, you only looked at the sand, didn’t you?
64|A sandbox is only a sandbox when you include the container.
64|That’s why, if you’re going to investigate the 'sandbox’, Araragi,
64|you have to investigate the container as well, or you won’t have investigated it properly.
64|When you think of sand, it’s usually weighty, As long as there’s nothing unusual, that is.
64|There was no need to think anymore
64|since the bottom of the sandbox container had fissured likely due to deterioration,
64|and since it had fissured together with the weight of the sand, as Hanekawa mentioned,
64|the answer was the sand settling to form a shape like that.
64|The fact that it was the form of a demon was, as expected, a coincidence.
64|Right now, it was only a natural phenomenon that would cause a strange design.
64|But if the fissures of the container continued to get bigger,
64|the floor would soon break into pieces and the dirt would mix with the sand,
64|which could make it possible for quicksand or liquefaction to occur.
64|That was the worst possible circumstance,
64|and playing inside a fissured container was plenty dangerous,
64|like a race against time.
64|That’s why Hanekawa got angry with me.
64|For the time being I should call the company that manages the park.
64|The scarier one, and the one that wasn’t peaceful at all,
64|was neither an oddity nor a human,
64|but nature.
64|As scary as a demon, and as scary as a person.
64|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
64|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
64|We were happy children full of curiosity,
64|I was the one who pushed you forward,
64|from that day onward.
64|Let's escape our confines
64|and take our time along the way
64|Let's ride our bikes to far away
64|carrying our hopes and dreams in the basket
64|Is the future we heard so many rumors about,
64|A nice place to be?
64|Even if we ask our extending shadows about it,
64|we'll still be none the wiser
65|I captured that scene subconsciously in my head.
65|This is not the future
65|I've been longing for.
65|Unknown to me, never before seen smile...
65|I stood there completely frozen, as if rooted to the spot.
65|Both of us just act so erraticaly. Our worlds stray from each other.
65|Everything is just so erratic. I can't shake off these contradicting feelings.
65|With my reckless heart
65|Someday I will leave you behind
65|and go on
65|Before I noticed, my blind heart
65|managed to outstrip me.
65|Entwined by feelings,
65|Run, run. There's only one thing I can do.
65|Hurry, hurry, hurry to a place beyond here.

65|Kanbaru, you didn’t do anything like filling up this room
65|with junk from other rooms just to harass me, knowing I'd be coming to tidy up, did you?
65|What are you saying? You are casting unfounded suspicions on me.
65|Although, if it's Araragi who casts them,
65|I'm happy whether they're words of praise or suspicion!
65|What's the point in praising someone who's like that?
65|Well, I’ll be going now. It’s gotten really late.
65|Hold it right there, Araragi!
65|Did you think that, after Araragi, who I hold in the highest esteem,
65|cleans my room for me
65|I would send him off without doing anything?
65|Without doing anything…
65|What were you planning on doing to me!?
65|I thought I'd make some tea.
65|No, tea won't do.
65|I should at least prepare a meal for you, Araragi.
65|'Kay, I'll let you treat me to dinner.
65|Now then, Araragi. Before we go for dinner,
65|please take a bath.
65|Eating dinner looking that dirty would be...
65|bothersome!
65|…I can't relax at all.
65|What’s this?! The door won’t open!
65|It’s locked!
65|Are you all right, Araragi?!
65|I’ll come save you!
65|Open up immediately!
65|Come out with your hands up!
65|That's an order!
65|I am Kanbaru Suruga!
65|Araragi’s sex slave.
65|Red
65|My special move is the Wall Jump!
65|Why won’t it open…
65|I have no choice. I’ll go get those sticks that the riot police use when they break in!
65|Stop it! And don't go bringing those things you don't know the name of!
65|Oh, Araragi? So you’re safe...?
65|That really surprised me…
65|I thought you'd been been imprisoned, Araragi,
65|so I was really worried.
65|There's only one person in the world who'd want to imprison me, and that's you!
65|Not necessarily.
65|Senjougahara might be likely to do it.
65|No way. Not even Senjougahara would go that far.
65|If you’re misunderstanding something then I’d like to correct it, but Araragi,
65|I just thought I’d wash your clothes for you while you bathed.
65|I had no shameful thoughts whatsoever.
65|If you’d like, as well as your clothes,
65|I can wash your body for you, too!
65|Front and back!
65|As thanks for making my room nice and clean.
65|I’m saying I’d like to make your body nice and clean, Araragi!
65|Clean up that mind of yours first of all!
65|Even though you use such a nice bath every day, you have such a dirty mind!
65|When you say that it is a nice bath, I cannot help but say that it is so.
65|If I act humbly here, it might seem sarcastic.
65|But not only the bath, the water is nice too.
65|We boil the water drawn from the well in our yard.
65|Deep somethingwater with lots of somethingsium.
65|Speaking of which, Araragi.
65|What is it, young Kanbaru?
65|The water from the well actually has a past, you know?
65|What kind of a past are you talking about?
65|It’s a story about my father, you see.
65|Naturally, my father also used this bath on a regular basis.
65|On a regular basis, huh?
65|However, since childhood, whenever he took a bath, on rare occasions,
65|something very curious occured.
65|Something curious?
65|A curious phenomenon,
65|I guess you could say.
65|I wouldn't call it oddity-related,
65|but a mysterious phenomenon occured.
65|That's quite a, or rather,
65|a considerably specific detail.
65|Araragi. Have a look at the water's surface in the bathtub.
65|I’m looking. It may be too late now… But is there something about this water?
65|No, not the water.
65|I said it clearly, didn’t I? It’s not the water I wanted you to look at,
65|It’s the surface.
65|From : Senjougahara Hitagi
65|Subject : So apparently you went to Kanbaru's room.
65|Body : Empty
65|Calling
65|Call in Progress
65|Die.
65|Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.
65|I-I can't die just yet.
65|I’ve only just become your boyfriend.
65|We’ve only just started going out.
65|I want to go on more dates with you.
65|Life is way too precious to die right now!
65|Senjougahara Hitagi
65|Hands Free
65|Oh my.
65|You say some pretty nice things, don’t you.
65|Then, you don’t have to die.
65|Senjougahara, you're too soft.
65|Tell me to die a little more than that.
65|And so that's why I went to clean at Kanbaru’s house today.
65|Senjougahara Hitagi
65|Hands Free
65|To clean the room of an underclassman?
65|Aren't you the caring role model.
65|Although taking a bath there is rather impudent. I think you should die.
65|Don’t think that.
65|It's better than saying I'll kill you, isn't it?
65|So, Araragi. What do you think of what Kanbaru said?
65|Well, it sure was a mysterious story.
65|No, maybe it wasn’t mysterious?
65|I don’t know if I should say it was a romantic story.
65|In the surface of the water, Kanbaru’s dad
65|saw the image of the girl he would would be tied to in the future.
65|That was the story.
65|Not always, but occasionally.
65|Apparently he saw the image of the partner he would elope with in the surface of the water,
65|But after a while it stopped appearing.
65|So when Kanbaru’s dad met Kanbaru’s mom, that is, Gaen Tooe,
65|he was extremely shocked.
65|Senjougahara Hitagi
65|Hands Free
65|Incidentally, when Kanbaru told you
65|to look at the surface of the water,
65|who was reflected there, I wonder?
65|Me?
65|Or perhaps me?
65|You’re annoying!
65|Hanekawa?
65|Kanbaru?
65|Hachikuji?
65|Scary!
65|Black
65|No, there wasn’t anybody reflected there…
65|It was just my own reflection, like normal.
65|Senjougahara Hitagi
65|Hands Free
65|Well, I’ve heard about it from Kanbaru before, you see.
65|Well, the truth was that I had forgotten until you told me.
65|Back then I was a good kid and didn’t say anything unrefined.
65|Like I said, at the time my personality was quite pleasant.
65|Senjougahara Hitagi
65|Hands Free
65|Back before I was a contrarian,
65|ill-natured, awful-tempered girl.
65|Too much self-awareness.
65|I didn’t add interpretation to that inelegant,
65|romantic, oddity-free love story, is what I mean.
65|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
65|Eh? What?
65|So, Kanbaru’s dad simply saw his own face reflected on surface of the water like a mirror,
65|and thought it was his ‘fated companion’, is what you're saying?
65|No, I don’t think… that could happen.
65|The water's surface shifts, sparkles and sways.
65|It different to a mirror's appearance.
65|Thus isn’t it possible that he might have seen his own shifting reflection as a girl?
65|Well… Certainly, for very young kids,
65|gender difference are few, so in that case it may be possible.
65|But surely once he became an adult,
65|or even just reached some level of discernment, he’d normally notice.
65|He did notice. That’s why it stopped appearing.
65|However, the memories of person he saw in the surface of the water remained.
65|And that's why he thought it was his 'fated companion’?
65|That’s quite the deduction.
65|That sequence is backwards, you see.
65|It was after he met someone he thought to be his 'fated companion’
65|that she resembled the reflection in the water's surface he'd seen long ago.
65|Oh, so that's how it goes
65|from his point of view?
65|Senjougahara Hitagi
65|Hands Free
65|In romance, one is prone to look
65|for someone who resembles oneself.
65|That's just an interpretation of mine, though.
65|If you say too much to Kanbaru, I’ll kill you.
65|If you do tell her, I won’t forgive you.
65|If you let something slip by accident, please kill yourself by tomorrow.
65|Call Terminated
65|Araragi Koyomi
65|Call Incoming
65|Call In Progress
65|Hey, Kanbaru. There was something I forgot to ask you, but what about you?
65|What do you see when you look at the surface of the water in that bath?
65|If Kanbaru’s dad’s explanation was correct, then Kanbaru’s fated companion would appear.
65|But if Senjougahara’s explanation was right,
65|then the image that might be reflected could be Kanbaru's mom.
65|It wouldn’t be strange if Kanbaru saw her dad’s reflection instead.
65|That being the case, that would be pretty romantic in itself.
65|Hm? Oh. I can see my breasts of course.
65|If I do say so myself, they’re very erotic, and I stare at them all the time when I’m bathing.
65|The contrast with my abs below is really vivid,
65|and every night I feel a rush of blood when I look at them.
65|In all honesty nothing else enters my vision.
65|So, what about it, Araragi―

66|One, two!
66|But that's no-no
66|See, with that
66|my heart is evolving more and more.
66|"If the bond is gone soon as it's put to words."
66|“Better not say anything"
66|Or so I thought, backing away.
66|But huh? Something's wrong with that.
66|Every long journey starts with one step,
66|so I'll make my resolve as hard as stone.
66|Many little things make up Yamato Nadeshiko,
66|Disregard the 'shi'? No, I mean my life!
66|Softly, gently, when you call my name,
66|with just that I float up into space.
66|Gently, softly, when you laugh,
66|with just that a smile comes to my face.
66|Thank you, God.
66|even if it's just fate pulling a prank,
66|I'm happy that I could meet you.
66|But that's no-no.
66|See, with that,
66|my heart is evolving more and more.
66|Right, we can't have that.
66|Hey, that'll come later.
66|Keep looking at me, forever and ever.

66|Oh, you're here, Sengoku. Come in.
66|Now that I think about it, I shouldn’t be intruding. I’ll go back home.
66|Don’t go back the second you make a visit.
66|F-f-farewell. I had fun today.
66|There’s no way you did!
66|I…
66|It was the best day of my life.
66|You... what exactly is fun about the Araragi household's entrance?
66|Master
66|What, are you supposedly a master of life?!
66|It was early August.
66|On day the incident of a certain con man was resolved,
66|Sengoku Nadeko came to visit my house.
66|Anyway, come on in.
66|I've made all the preparations for entertainment.
66|Today's party will be an all nighter!
66|To be honest, Tsukihi was also supposed to be with us…
66|But it seems she has some clean-up work to do again.
66|Ah, clean-up work? What kind?
66|Cleaning up after that con man.
66|It’s true. It’s a party, you set up a party!
66|For one.
66|Whoopsie daisy.
66|Was removing one's socks when you entered somebody's room a form of etiquette?
66|I.. I know Tsukihi is out but, Karen as well?
66|Yeah. Those two are a set, after all.
66|Sold as a package deal.
66|And… your parents?
66|My parents are out too, that is, they're at work. Working.
66|Th-then, today it’s just Nadeko and Koyomi. Just the two of us.
66|Well, I guess it is just the two of us.
66|Is there something about that?
66|Of course there’s no problem with it.
66|Well, first of all. Welcome, Sengoku!
66|Y-yes! Thank you, Koyomi!
66|Cheers!
66|Happy birthday!
66|My birthday was in April.
66|I finished telling Sengoku all I could regarding the case of the con man.
66|Koyomi, In my case it’s obvious…
66|But how exactly did Mister Con Man spread those rumors?
66|The rumors…
66|or charms…
66|or ghost stories.
66|The way he did it? That is-
66|Urban legends,
66|Street gossip,
66|Rumors.
66|Spreading them not as the listener but the speaker.
66|What specifically did you have to do to do that?
66|That con man, how did he manage to spread those rumors?
66|Firstly, who did everyone hear those rumors from?
66|Not from the con man himself?
66|Everyone around me said this:
66|'Rumors in the wind', they said.
66|Wind?
66|The process by which rumors spread.
66|Or is it the process by which one spreads rumors?
66|How exactly did that con man manage to pull something like that off?
66|If I wanted to circulate some kind of rumor… Then I would rely on Tsukihi.
66|She’s a celebrity among middle school girls, so if I tell the influential Tsukihi a rumor,
66|then it would be almost the same as telling a hundred people.
66|I doubt that con man probably used the methods we just talked about.
66|For a person like that, it's likely his plan was to circulate it as being from 'a friend of a friend’.
66|Even though it sounds contradictory…
66|Something that spreads without advertising, publicity, or any action whatsoever.
66|That’s what the ideal virus would be.
66|But… If you just expect something to spread on its own...
66|Something more spontaneous…
66|Aren't you just waiting for coincidence?

66|The power to read the wind, the power to raise the wind.
66|I don’t have anything like that.
66|Although, it’s possible that that’s a lie.
66|However, if you ask me, the power to read the wind isn’t very important in the first place,
66|because for pandemics, a windless condition is of most importance.
66|Windless?
66|When something’s popular,
66|it means that something else isn’t popular.
66|About this town specifically, I couldn’t lay a hand here during spring break.
66|Because the gossip about the 'vampire’ was sweeping over.
66|So once that rumor died out in a completely empty location,
66|in a location that was starving, I plunged in my own rumors.
66|Ghost stories, street gossip, urban legends.
66|When the human heart is in disarray, these baseless rumors run rampant.
66|When I say the human heart is in disarray, basically, there isn’t anything to rely on.
66|Think about what kind of lame ducks a con man might want to target.
66|I don’t even want to consider such things.
66|That would be…
66|The wealthy, right?
66|Don’t they go for the rich?
66|A virtuous peron's way of thinking.
66|Someone who is already satisfied is hard to deceive.
66|Humans with a surplus in their lives are humans with a surplus in their hearts.
66|That’s why the people that con men target are the dissatisfied,
66|the humans without a surplus in their hearts.
66|That’s why, when you came to this town, you went for the middle school girls?
66|I suppose. Hearts filled with anxiety are easy to deceive.
66|Because if they’re then filled up with lies, they don’t have the means to verify them.
66|You said that for my plan, I spread 'charms’ to cause the deterioration of human relations.
66|But it’s actually the opposite.
66|Because human relations were deteriorating, everyone jumped for my 'charms’.
66|Are you saying it’s their fault for being tricked?
66|When you say it like that, I want to agree.
66|Perhaps I should just say that the generation was bad.
66|'Why is something like this so popular?’
66|If you want to discuss a chaotic state like that,
66|you should first discuss the void before the chaos.
66|Void?
66|The darkness, one might say.
66|That’s why I’ll give you this piece of advice:
66|If 'something completely incomprehensible' starts getting popular,
66|doubt your generation.
66|Consider that something might be very wrong.
66|That's because the generation has been enveloped by darkness.
66|Enveloped by darkness.
66|Now, Araragi.
66|Now that I’ve taught you a very important trade secret of mine,
66|why don’t I accept a fee from you?
66|My guess is that the money you keep for a crucial moment is in your jacket's inside pocket.
66|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
66|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.

67|I can't ignore you and all you are

67|Late September.
67|I had come with my little sister, Araragi Karen,
67|to the dojo that she frequented.
67|Well, it really is a tree.
67|It has a pretty alluring presence.
67|Is it true?
67|The fact that this tree was here and apparently, nobody had realized it until now.
67|Let’s rewind the story.
67|I was alone in my room, studying for entrance exams.
67|Hey, bro. It’s the boobs you love so much!
67|What's up?
67|Is there something you need, Karen?
67|A very good question, but not the appropriate one.
67|The question you should be asking is, ‘When should we go?'
67|Don’t talk with the assumption that
67|I’ve agreed to help you, and I’m going to accompany you somewhere.
67|Take your enormous chest off my head right now and answer my question.
67|Do you need something?
67|Let’s see, do I need something?
67|But you already know what it is, don’t you?
67|Okay, you don’t need to say anything.
67|Just remove your enormous chest,
67|from your brother's head!
67|Fine. I’ll surrender this time.
67|I said they're enormous,
67|but they don't come close to Hanekawa's.
67|Now, don’t feel up your little sisters' boobs so much, bro.
67|In return, you must listen to what I have to say.
67|I don’t know what you heard from Tsukihi,
67|but in this instance it has nothing to do with me, all right?
67|You’re the ones who both unilaterally take advantage of me, you know?
67|Saying it's unilateral is unthinkable.
67|They say 'God dwells in an honest man's head.’
67|But for you it's just a matter of 'Boobs dwell in bro's head.' Right?
67|Please don’t apply such a ridiculous proverb to me, Karen.
67|What is it?
67|Spit it out.
67|You want me to tell you? I guess I have no choice.
67|The truth is, I want you to help me.
67|Deary me.
67|Karen, it’s impossible for people to help other people.
67|One can only help oneself of their own accord.
67|Don’t spew such meaningless shit.
67|I’ll punch you.
67|Stop saying all that boring stuff and listen to what I have to say, idiot.
67|Want me to beat you up a bit?
67|All right, I’ll listen.
67|Black
67|I’ll listen, so spit it out already. Speedily.
67|Thank you, bro, I’m so happy!
67|I’ll let you peek at my boobs while I talk!
67|Peek! Peek!
67|Hey bro! Feel free to feel up these legs while you listen!
67|They’re big and buxom.
67|You'd describe you legs as buxom?
67|The word's lissom.
67|Lissom
67|And I’m not going to feel you up!
67|If you don’t want me turning into a reticent type character,
67|let's hurry this discussion up.
67|It’s about a tree.
67|A tree was discovered at our dojo,
67|and now everyone is saying it's in the way.
67|That’s why I want to do something,
67|but I don’t have that kind of power, bro.
67|So you do something!
67|What, you don’t get it?
67|You really are dense, bro.
67|A tree was discovered at your dojo?
67|Um, do you mean those wooden boards that you break in karate?
67|No.
67|There’s a yard behind the dojo. And, we discovered a tree there!
67|And what I’m not getting is what you mean by you discovered it…
67|Like, you discovered some branches that had fallen in the backyard or something?
67|You really don’t understand anything, do you?
67|I never said anything about that.
67|All you think about are the boobs you're staring at.
67|Don’t look at your sister with those eyes!
67|I’m not looking, and regardless,
67|all that’s in my head right now is concern for my sister!
67|Thanks for your concern!
67|She hears only the good points.
67|It’s not branches. And it’s not the boards we break either.
67|It’s a growing tree.
67|A tree rooted in the ground!
67|No? You still don't get it?
67|I'll think it through, Karen.
67|Basically, in the backyard of the dojo you go to, a tree was growing…
67|and you hadn’t noticed that it had been growing there?
67|It wasn't just me.
67|Everybody.
67|Including my master who owns the dojo,
67|everyone only noticed a tree was there recently.
67|So, the other day, I discovered it.
67|It was a huge incident because nobody had noticed.
67|'Eh? What’s this?'
67|'Did someone plant it here overnight?'
67|Everyone was talking about it, and it was really rowdy.
67|But, you know… It’s kind of scary.
67|Despite using that backyard for all this time for training and stuff,
67|nobody ever noticed that a tree had been growing there.
67|That’s exactly it, bro!
67|That’s what everyone else is saying! That it’s scary.
67|Well, not scary, more like ominous or something.
67|Obviously Master doesn’t say anything like that,
67|but my less disciplined seniors and juniors are all getting the shivers and stuff!
67|So the fact that the tree had been growing without you noticing wasn’t ominous to you?
67|Nope.
67|I was surprised, but I wasn’t scared.
67|Rather, as a martial artist, the fact that I never noticed something like that
67|after all this time is rather embarrassing.
67|It’s so embarrassing I could almost kill myself!
67|Your martial artist mentality is way too weak.
67|I thought everyone else would feel the same way...
67|but I was wrong.
67|Since nobody felt that way.
67|They said that they were going to chop it down because it's scary.
67|We never noticed because we weren’t paying attention.
67|And once it's finally noticed,
67|we say it’s ominous and want to chop it down.
67|That's super unreasonable, right?
67|So basically, you want to settle this somehow in a way that prevents this tree
67|from being chopped down, right?
67|Yeah. My wish is for this tree to stay here forever, just the way it is.
67|Forever, huh…
67|I understand. Karen, feel free to rely on your reliable brother.
67|Specifically, what'll you do?
67|I’ll do something.
67|Do something, Hanekawa!
67|Don’t delegate everything to me…
67|Hanekawa Tsubasa
67|Hands Free
67|Please!
67|I’ll let you do whatever you want with your boobs!
67|My boobs are already mine in the first place.
67|Well, alright.
67|It’s for Karen, after all.
67|First off I’d like to hear what you think about the whole thing.
67|Between Karen or those around her, who do you support?
67|That would be Karen, of course.
67|It’s terrible to think of getting rid of a tree that’s still living,
67|without a justifiable reason.
67|If you asked me why nobody had noticed the tree’s existence until now,
67|rather than noticing or not noticing, it’s just that nobody was really conscious of it.
67|But when it was noticed for even a moment, it became really noticeable.
67|And it’ll be more noticeable in one's eyes than it needs to be.
67|When you learn a new word, and you see that word in a sentence,
67|that word seems to stand out more.
67|Something like that?
67|Right. Well, I wonder.
67|I’d like to confirm something, Araragi.
67|Hanekawa Tsubasa
67|Hands Free
67|Right now at that dojo, the panic is a pandemic-like situation, right?
67|Saying panic seems exaggerated…
67|But I suppose it is kind of like a mass infection.
67|Hanekawa Tsubasa
67|Hands Free
67|Then, it just needs to be brought to an end.
67|Well, that’s true.
67|But it’s hard to keep a pandemic in check, isn’t it?
67|That’s what’s troublesome.
67|Hanekawa Tsubasa
67|Hands Free
67|No, there’s a way.
67|A way of stopping a pandemic.
67|Hanekawa Tsubasa
67|Hands Free
67|Rather than a way of stopping it,
67|it’s more like a way for it to stop.
67|No choice this time, I guess.
67|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
67|Firstly the conclusion.
67|In the end, the old tree that Karen was trying to protect, wasn't chopped down.
67|In order for a pandemic or a panic to stop,
67|it has to arrive at its destination, then it will stop.
67|In short, no matter the virus, once it spreads until it can’t spread any further,
67|the infection will stop, and the situation will naturally begin to resolve itself.
67|But it was pretty clear that we couldn't let it arrive at its destination.
67|If this pandemic was allowed to reach its ‘destination’,
67|then the result would be the disposal of that old tree.
67|Therefore, we simply extend the goal.
67|Right now, everyone thinks the tree is at the level of 'ominous’, right?
67|Or possibly a level above, at 'scary'.
67|That kind of recognition, right?
67|We just need to take it a step further.
67|That will be the goal.
67|Araragi Koyomi
67|Hands Free
67|A step further…
67|Reverence, right?
67|The next day,
67|D
67|O
67|J
67|O
67|Karen told rest of the dojo students this:
67|That the old tree was made of the same wood used to build the sacred dojo.
67|That the god who protects the dojo
67|made the tree grow in the backyard.
67|That’s why such a bizarre phenomenon occurred.
67|For many decades up til now, whilst hiding his prescense from the dojo's students,
67|the god of martial arts, who watched over the dojo
67|used all his strength to take physical form.
67|It would be outrageous to chop the tree down.
67|This fabrication that Hanekawa came up with was adopted almost word for word.
67|With the truth being what it is, there’s no way they’d think to hurt the tree.
67|Of course, this wasn’t a lie meant to fool Karen’s master.
67|Considering it normally,
67|The wood used to build the dojo, and that old tree,
67|couldn't be the same.
67|But, the master probably won’t point that out.
67|As promised, Karen did manage to persuade the others, after all?
67|For now, that old tree’s life was tethered.
67|Karen, having 'discovered’ the tree,
67|made it her duty to protect it to the end.
67|But no matter what, telling a lie makes you feel bad…
67|But it’s not necessarily a lie.
67|Hanekawa Tsubasa
67|Hands Free
67|It’s possible the tree may actually have been an oddity.
67|To begin with, it's not completely impossible for the wood used
67|to build the dojo and that tree to be the same.
67|The probability isn’t zero.
67|Hanekawa Tsubasa
67|Hands Free
67|What are you talking about?
67|The probably of that is still way too low.
67|Just because it’s low doesn’t make it impossible.
67|Also,
67|because we created an explanation like that,
67|Isn't it possible the tree may actually have become an oddity?
67|The kind of oddity that watches over those undergoing training.
67|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
67|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
67|We were happy children full of curiosity,
67|I was the one who pushed you forward,
67|from that day onward.
67|Let's escape our confines
67|and take our time along the way
67|Let's ride our bikes to far away
67|carrying our hopes and dreams in the basket
67|Is the future we heard so many rumors about,
67|A nice place to be?
67|Even if we ask our extending shadows about it,
67|we'll still be none the wiser

68|Brother, do you believe in ghosts and the like?
68|Ghosts?
68|What’s with that?
68|Did you hear something from Sengoku?
68|Why is Nadeko’s name coming up?
68|Sometimes you say things that make no sense, brother.
68|No, it's nothing!
68|But why are you suddenly asking about ghosts?
68|What, is it something like a ghost appearing in your tea ceremony club?
68|That’s right!
68|I’m surprised you got it!
68|A fluke
68|Or more correctly, a ghost had been appearing in the tea ceremony club.
68|Had been appearing? What do you mean by that?
68|Were there traces of it left in the club room?
68|No, I wouldn’t say it left any traces…
68|That kid,
68|there’s no objective evidence for its existence.
68|That kid?
68|A strangely specific way of referring to it.
68|Tsukihi, I’ll tell you something good.
68|If there’s no evidence, that means there was no ghost!
68|Okay, that settles the matter.
68|Well, we can just chat about something else now.
68|I want this to be a proper consultation!
68|Not some idle chatter!
68|Okay, okay.
68|Whoa there, now.
68|I get it, so put that ballpoint pen away.
68|Put it away?
68|Of the three colors in this tricolor pen, which are you saying to put away?
68|All of them!
68|Red, blue, black, all of them!
68|So, what exactly are you saying here?
68|There’s no evidence for the ghost you said appeared in the tea ceremony club.
68|That’s what I said! Weren’t you listening?
68|If I were to guess, would you be the one who proved there was no ghost?
68|Wow. How’d you figure that out?
68|The story probably went something like this:
68|Rumors were circulating about a ghost appearing in the tea ceremony club room,
68|Tsukihi, probably not as part of the Fire Sisters,
68|but as Araragi Tsukihi individually, set out to investigate the rumor.
68|And then, she resolved it.
68|What do you think I should do, brother?
68|Huh? About what?
68|So, you see,
68|I was able to logically explain the fact that there was no ghost…
68|But nobody believes it, you know?
68|Everyone believes in the ghost instead of believing in me.
68|I took all the circumstantial evidence,
68|including the witness account that started the whole rumor
68|about an 'eighth person’ in the tea ceremony club
68|despite it having only seven members, and logically refuted them one by one.
68|Logically.
68|You don’t need to emphasize logically.
68|It almost sounds like you’re lying.
68|Are you calling me a liar? Rude!
68|So after going through quite a lot of trouble,
68|I managed to disprove the eighth person's existence.
68|But when I told everyone, they just said this:
68|'That might be the case, but whatever.'
68|'What Tsukihi says might be right,
68|and that might be the case in theory,
68|but, even so, the "eighth person” may still exist.’
68|- is what they keep saying! The rumors just won’t stop!
68|So what do you think, brother?
68|What do you think I should do?
68|What you should do?
68|What do you think I should do in this situation?
68|How should I put it?
68|I asserted what was right, and everyone understands that it was right,
68|so the confrontation, the conflict of opinion, is all over now,
68|but the circumstances haven’t changed at all from before…
68|It’s as if what’s 'right’ has no meaning, and there’s no effect.
68|What should I do?
68|Without even arguing against it, they just ignored you
68|and continued to make a racket over this 'eighth person,’ is that right?
68|That's right.
68|In this case,
68|what sort of advice can I give?
68|Hey, Tsukihi. So, what exactly do you want me to do?
68|What’s with that question?
68|Brother. Weren’t you listening to what I was saying?
68|Hey, you don’t need to look so surprised…
68|You don’t need to look so surprised while sounding like you’re going to attack me.
68|My skin narrowly avoided being dyed three colors.
68|Just give it to me straight, Tsukihi.
68|What do you want me to do?
68|It bothers me when you say it like that,
68|So, I want to hear your opinion, as research.
68|Brother, do you believe in ghosts?
68|She returned to her first question.
68|What is it?! Why do you look so cornered trying to answer?!
68|This is one you can answer and finish off with a simple 'yes’ or 'no’, you know?
68|No, no, Tsukihi.
68|The problems of the world aren't all easily finished off with a simple 'yes’ or 'no'.
68|Is that so?
68|In this case I’d be okay with finishing off my brother with a simple 'yes’ or 'no’.
68|It's 'no'.
68|I don’t believe in ghosts.
68|The tea ceremony club members besides you are definitely wrong,
68|and I can guarantee that you’re correct, so don’t worry about it anymore.
68|You just stay the way you are, and stay true to your own correctness.
68|You’re right.
68|But it still bothers me.
68|Well, It’s not like her acceptance or denial the existence of the 'eighth person'
68|will cause the tea ceremony club to break up, or anything serious like that.
68|It’s just that she’s hitting a wall.
68|A wall?
68|As someone who advocates justice,
68|being in an environment that ignores something that’s right
68|makes her feel ill at ease.
68|Situations where the unreasonable or irrational are in control actually happen pretty often.
68|Experiencing irrationality like this can be useful for the future, right?
68|Irrationality, huh?
68|But I think reason has already been hunted down enough,
68|so personally it makes me want to become Tsukihi’s ally.
68|You’ve always been the ally of cute girls, though.
68|No, cuteness is not related in this case.
68|Because if I said that,
68|it’s possible the other six members of the tea ceremony club are also cute!
68|What kind of way of thinking that?
68|But, aren’t you like that, too, Araragi?
68|Because you and I know about oddities.
68|The irrational,
68|the unreasonable,
68|the absurd.
68|We know it.
68|That’s exactly why I want to become Tsukihi’s ally.
68|For Tsukihi, who’s trying to deny oddities, who’s sacrificing herself for reality.
68|Well, certainly. When you say it like that, then I want to agree,
68|but even so, it can’t be helped, can it?
68|There’s nothing we can do about it, is there?
68|If you were to insist, Araragi,
68|then I wouldn't mind marching into
68|Tsuganoki Second Junior High’s Tea Ceremony Club myself!
68|I won't insist.
68|Though I just wonder if there is any way to calm Tsukihi’s temper?
68|Yeah, there is a way.
68|If your goal, Araragi, is just to placate Tsukihi for now, then there is a way!
68|It’s not exactly that I want to placate her, but...
68|there is?
68|However, this solution has just one problem.
68|There's a problem?
68|It’s not good if there’s a problem.
68|What kind of problem is it?
68|The end result will be that we’re deceiving Tsukihi.
68|Say, Araragi, are you opposed to lying to your sisters in any way?
68|Not in the slightest.
68|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
68|Why did Tsukihi’s fellow club members
68|continue to obstinately believe in the ‘eighth person’?
68|After the truth was made apparent, after reason was shown,
68|why did they continue to believe in it based on emotion?
68|In short, if I were able to explain that,
68|If I could give a logical explanation for their irrationality,
68|then Tsukihi might accept it.
68|So Kanbaru added a reason for it.
68|The logic she came up with was
68|that everyone continued believing in the 'eighth person’ for Tsukihi’s sake.
68|Tsukihi often takes as she pleases from the clubroom’s inventory of tea and snacks.
68|Well, it wasn’t something to make a big fuss over,
68|but strictly speaking it was not something to be admired.
68|If word got out,
68|it would certainly be possible for club activities to be suspended.
68|So, by hypothesizing an 'eighth person,’
68|the rate at which the inventory decreased was accounted for.
68|Though they never planned to conspire against her, in order to protect Tsukihi,
68|everyone acknowledged this 'eighth member’ to have joined the club.
68|Is that so? Everyone did it for my sake!
68|The idiot fell for it immediately.
68|And here I was, boorishly saying that there was no such thing as ghosts,
68|but it was actually my attitude that was the ghost, huh!
68|That wasn’t clever at all.
68|All right, I’ll let myself fall for it!
68|I’ll let myself fall for it.
68|I’ll let the tea be muddied.
68|When I told Kanbaru,
68|The tea ceremony club members or Araragi,
68|I wonder which one she let herself be deceived by?
68|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
68|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
68|We were happy children full of curiosity,
68|I was the one who pushed you forward,

69|Surely I'd heard some sort of reason,
69|and I'm carelessly forgetting it...
69|Mountains are said to be the places where gods reside.
69|I consider it to be my 'main field', or something like that.
69|Mountains are, well, how should I put it,
69|somewhat similar to oddities.
69|So it’s my specialty, to put it shortly.
69|I understand why a shrine was placed on the summit, too.
69|Although, the Shrine of the Polar Snake and this mountain used to be completely unrelated.
69|They say that forcibly bringing together
69|unrelated things produces conflict, though, right?
69|Conflict?
69|Ah, please ignore that.
69|Regretably there were mistakes in the initial stages,
69|so now it's a matter which needs endlessly redoing.
69|Have people said that this shrine being built on the mountain a long time ago was a mistake?
69|I’m...
69|here to fix that mistake.
69|Is this it?
69|Yeah, it is.
69|That’s what Oshino told me to put here.
69|Well, just barely in this case, but
69|a tentative balance has been attained.
69|The ground's atmosphere feels refreshing too.
69|Refreshing, huh?
69|Yes.
69|To be able to call this a gathering place for 'bad things' became difficult at some point, at least.
69|Naturally, as on the last day of summer vacation,
69|Shinobu and I had completely 'refreshed’ this place.
69|Although, me coming here today could be another matter…
69|What are you doing, Ougi?
69|Like a monkey, or maybe a cat.
69|The snake god is a representative,
69|but are you aware of how snakes became deified here, though they are not on the level of gods?
69|How snakes were deified…
69|It’s not as if they serve any purpose to the lives of humans like cows or horses.
69|And they don’t live close either. There were more candidates, like bugs or worms.
69|Why do you think this is?
69|Why…
69|Let's see...
69|That’s right.
69|Snakes are supposed to be symbols of immortality or rebirth, I think?
69|You’ve come up with the right answer all of a sudden.
69|Snakes shed their skin in order to grow, after all.
69|Thinking about the secretive nature of snakes,
69|it’s possible that the skin left behind is more noticeable than the snakes themselves.
69|Well, in an era when biology wasn't as advanced as now,
69|if you had managed to observe a snake shedding...
69|you’d want to start considering it sacred.
69|The problem right now is cleaning up the affairs of this shrine.
69|Cleaning up the Shrine of the Polar Snake, which over a thousand years ago
69|enshrined a snake that lived over a thousand years.
69|You could also say it’s cleaning up after my uncle.
69|What do you mean?
69|Haven't we already taken care of the situation where it could become a gathering place?
69|I’ll say this in a way that’s easy to understand.
69|My uncle, after the invasion of the typhoon named Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade
69|was successful in cleaning up
69|But I wonder, And I think my uncle was being naive here,
69|But surely if another oddity on Heart-Under-Blade's level visited,
69|there'd be no countermeasure for that, right?
69|Instead of just keeping the peace for the present,
69|I believe we should form a countermeasure for the gathering place itself for the next time.
69|Without a gathering place, there would be no place for the 'bad things’ to gather.
69|You said the shrine being on this mountain,
69|was a mistake in the early stages which set things off balance.
69|But it’s not something a high school girl like you can do something about now, right?
69|It’s not like we can just move the shrine somewhere else at this point.
69|Yes, that’s right.
69|Speaking of history, Araragi.
69|The truth is, this shrine, the Shrine of the Polar Snake, used to be in a completely different location.
69|Completely different?
69|Yes. At that point even the name was different,
69|but for a certain reason, it was transferred to this mountain.
69|It was placed here.
69|On the peak of this mountain,
69|the very place I’m standing on.
69|There was something I wanted you to think about, Araragi.
69|The shrine that was in another place, the former Shrine of the Polar Snake,
69|how did the people back then, that is, the shrine's officials,
69|manage to relocate to the peak of this mountain?
69|...is what I’m saying.
69|How…
69|Well, we’re talking about something that happened a while back, right?
69|In that case, maybe they took apart the building and moved it like that.
69|But, Araragi, it wasn’t as if taking the shrine apart made the parts any easier to carry.
69|After all,
69|the path we climbed up on didn’t exist in the past.
69|In that case…
69|Wouldn’t the usual way to be to open a path to carry the building materials?
69|It was a sacred mountain that was rather dignified. They couldn’t possibly perform such large-scale construction.
69|Of course, a minimum amount of construction is necessary to transfer the shrine to the peak
69|What, did they use some technique that isn’t part of this world?
69|Like some supernatural superpower, or a spiritual power,
69|like, something miraculous.
69|No, there was nothing of the sort.
69|It was simply the intelligence of humans.
69|If you ask me, it was a 'moving’ that was an extreme annoyance.
69|You could say that it’s because of it that I came here, to this town.
69|White
69|Really, what exactly is a Polar Snake?
69|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
69|That’s simple, Koyomi.
69|It’s an easy game.
69|An easy game…?
69|It seems like they didn’t do any large-scale construction like paving roads,
69|but from hearing what you said, Koyomi, they had to do a minimum amount, right?
69|Hm? Yeah…
69|So, the people doing the construction, the people who completed it…
69|On the peak, they had to clear away the land and make space to build the shrine, right?
69|Yup. Well, clearing land away to make space…
69|That would be considered the minimum amount of construction, right?
69|Right. So, they used the wood from the trees they cut down to build the shrine.
69|With that, they don’t need to carry any lumber up to the top of the mountain, right?
69|So they didn’t need to trail blaze a new path.
69|But, Sengoku. It’s a relocation, you know?
69|Not a new building,
69|but 'moving’.
69|If they had used new wood and built a new shrine, wouldn’t it just be a completely different shrine?
69|Corpse…
69|I mean, bodies of worship, they’d probably take stuff like that with them.
69|But if you’re going to move anyway, wouldn’t you rather want to build a new shrine?
69|So they just shifted the building, switching it out, and kept only the name.
69|As long as the faith didn’t change.
69|No matter what else changed, at least that wouldn’t change.
69|No, what was important was the balance.
69|Enshrining a god on top of that mountain destroyed some kind of balance.
69|…By the way, I just thought of this from that quiz, Koyomi.
69|Er, it wasn’t supposed to be a quiz.
69|That shrine, even though it’s in ruins,
69|I wonder if it will ever be rebuilt.
69|Rebuilt…
69|But even so, what would happen to Ougi's so-called balance?
69|Without any visitors to the shrine.
69|To rebuild a shrine with no god.
69|If it was reformed, what sort of faith would be born there?
69|That was wrong.
69|It wouldn’t be born.
69|It would continue.
69|No matter what logic you apply,
69|no matter what theories you form.
69|Faith and oddities...
69|continue to exist.
69|It would be nice if they rebuilt it,
69|If they rebuilt the shrine, then I bet it would stop being a place for 'bad things’ to gather.
69|And then, Kuchinawa,
69|I mean, the snake god will probably return to the shrine, too.
69|Right, Koyomi?
69|Ah… Right.
69|It would be nice if that happened.
69|Good? Bad?
69|I had no way of knowing that.
69|In any case, at some point,
69|it was something that could destroy the balance of our town.
69|I had a bad premonition.
69|No, not a premonition, I felt that it was real.
69|That it wasn’t long until the day I would use the talisman given to me by Gaen Izuko.
69|Until the day I had no choice but to use it.
69|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
69|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
69|We were happy children full of curiosity,
69|I was the one who pushed you forward,
69|from that day onward.
69|Let's escape our confines
69|and take our time along the way
69|Let's ride our bikes to far away
69|carrying our hopes and dreams in the basket
69|Is the future we heard so many rumors about,
69|A nice place to be?
69|Even if we ask our extending shadows about it,
69|we'll still be none the wiser

70|Fantastico!
70|Hey, Shinobu.
70|Morning.
70|Morntastico.
70|That's what it was.
70|A prime case of 'It's always darkest under the candlestick.'
70|I thought I would get some sugar during break time.
70|Are they donuts?
70|They’re donuts, right?
70|They have to be donuts!
70|Well, they are donuts.
70|So they are donuts! That's magnificent!
70|Now, my master, please present those donuts to me immediately!
70|My master.
70|What is it?
70|What are these?
70|Are they a new product of Mister Donut?
70|No, no.
70|Senjougahara visited just now.
70|She brought me these donuts as a sign of support.
70|For what reason?
70|Well, if you must ask for a reason...
70|Then it’s to encourage me in my exam preparation.
70|Is it not cheaper to buy them?
70|Senjougahara made these donuts for me for no charge.
70|Did you not pay any money, my master?
70|I’ve never heard of a girlfriend that asks for money in exchange for refreshments.
70|Impossible!
70|To think that miser would…
70|Be careful, my master!
70|There could be something in these!
70|Now hold on, what do you think a person's girlfriend is?
70|If anything's in them, it's love.
70|You personally experienced last month how love
70|can turn into poison depending on how it's prepared, no?
70|What is this hole?
70|Hole?
70|This suspicious hole.
70|It’s possible that something was injected into this donut via this hole.
70|No, stop trying to act like such a clichéd idiot.
70|Donuts are supposed to have holes in them.
70|Why is that?
70|Donuts like that with holes in them are a variety of donut called torus donuts.
70|By making a hole in the center like that, the heat can circulate better when they are fried.
70|So you call this shape a torus?
70|If you’re going to check whether it’s poisoned,
70|the best way would be to taste it, you know?
70|Are you telling me to be your poison taster?
70|What a cruel master I have!
70|I have no words!
70|Im telling you now,
70|I’m not one to think that all donuts are fine, you know?
70|If you want to escape from my investigation,
70|then you should go to the Mister Donut Shinobu branch store immediately
70|and buy the Pon De Ring Nama Choco Golden!
70|Can you believe it?
70|It’s already a breakthrough to make a Nama form of the Pon De Ring,
70|but then they arranged it like a Golden Chocolate, you know?
70|I haven’t tasted it yet,
70|but just by imagining the flavor, I can almost feel it expanding in my mouth,
70|and I’m certain that I’ll shout, without being afraid of what others might think,
70|Japantastico!
70|It's become more like a war cry extolling Japan.
70|Well done!
70|Call that tsundere girl immediately! I wish to praise her directly!
70|You’ve come all this way hardly ever interacting with Senjougahara,
70|wouldn't it be odd suddenly meeting her after being moved by donuts?
70|What are you doing?
70|I could ask the same thing, my master.
70|The poison tasting is not yet over.
70|No, it is over, right?
70|You ate it as normal and said it was delicious as normal, didn’t you?
70|You never know.
70|It could be poison with a delayed effect.
70|And so, the poison inspection shall continue.
70|If I do a comparison inspection of four more samples, I should be able to derive the results.
70|Four samples?
70|Dear Shinobu, from what I can see,
70|the number of remaining donuts happens to be exactly four.
70|The exact number? Now that is an ideal coincidence.
70|No, you just intentionally set up the experiment to suit your needs!
70|Hand over that plate!
70|I will not.
70|As my master’s attendant,
70|it is my duty to protect him from any risk, no matter how small!
70|Don’t act like my attendant only when it’s convenient for you!
70|This is your last warning, Shinobu. Hand over that plate!
70|Haha
70|You sure are poor at negotiations, my master.
70|Never letting go of that stubborn attitude, persistently repeating 'hand it over.’
70|Isn’t that the reason that the talisman entrusted to you
70|by the boss of the specialists was stolen from you?
70|If back then you had been able to negotiate properly,
70|we wouldn’t be trapped in the situation we're in right now.
70|You need to reflect on your actions.
70|Why do I need negotiation skills to keep you in check
70|each and every time you want to eat donuts?
70|Before negotiation skills, my master, you should first hone your sense of secrecy.
70|Secrecy?
70|If you'd simply hidden that talisman in a better place,
70|you wouldn't have had to do any negotiating to keep us out of this situation.
70|That talisman, hidden in that easy-to-find hiding place,
70|can be said to mark the beginning of this tragedy.
70|If it were me, I would definitely have hidden that talisman better.
70|And would definitely have hidden the donuts better, as well.
70|My master, know that your own foolishness
70|is what brought about our unfortunate circumstances!
70|Then, tell me this, Shinobu.
70|The case of the talisman aside,
70|if it were you, how would you have hidden the donuts?
70|If you give me just five minutes,
70|I’ll have these donuts disappear before your very eyes with splendor.
70|You’ll never be able to find them.
70|Now hold on,
70|if I gave you five minutes, you’ll just eat the rest of the donuts in that time.
70|If you just eat them and say, "Look, they're gone!" then that's totally cheating.
70|Do you really think I’d use such a crafty trick?
70|You would. Definitely.
70|Well, I don’t know about all four of them, but if it was one or two, I could definitely hide them.
70|How about we bet
70|whether I can hide the donuts in five minutes,
70|5
70|and whether you can find them in five minutes.
70|5
70|The rule will be that out of the four donuts,
70|the donuts that you were unable to find will be mine to eat.
70|In other words my master, if you are able to find all four of them,
70|then you may eat all four of them.
70|All right, I got it.
70|But I’ll say this once more, hiding it does not mean eating it, okay?
70|I get it, I get it,
70|and hiding it in my cleavage is not allowed either, of course.
70|Where is there any cleavage on that little girl's chest?
70|There’s still another problem.
70|And it isn't to do with cheating prevention,
70|but a more realistic problem regarding the game.
70|What is it?
70|You’re bound to my shadow, aren’t you?
70|In that case, wouldn’t it be really hard to hide from me and be secretive in the first place?
70|Well, the only choice is to use a blindfold.
70|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
70|Hanekawa Tsubasa
70|Hands Free
70|Using leggings as a blindfold?
70|Pervert.
70|I’ll stop you there, Hanekawa.
70|It’s not that I myself wanted to use the leggings as a blindfold.
70|Blindfolding me with leggings,
70|and stuffing leggings into my mouth,
70|was all Shinobu’s doing.
70|Hanekawa Tsubasa
70|Hands Free
70|Stuffing leggings into your mouth…?
70|Slip of the tongue.
70|Well, Hanekawa, I want to ask you.
70|Where do you think Shinobu hid the donuts?
70|I was able to find three of the donuts that she hid, but I couldn’t find the last one.
70|I mean, it’s my room, right?
70|There’s a limit to where you can hide stuff in there.
70|Hanekawa Tsubasa
70|Hands Free
70|In that case, I can only think that Shinobu must have eaten it…
70|But after saying it so much, it’s hard to believe that she would go against the rules like that.
70|So despite everything you've said you still have faith in Shinobu.
70|Well if you say so, Araragi,
70|then she must have gone with the second strongest possibility.
70|The second strongest?
70|So there was something I overlooked?
70|You said the donuts had various sizes, right?
70|Then, among the four remaining donuts,
70|the smallest donut would have been hidden in the largest donut, surely?
70|Araragi Koyomi
70|Hands Free
70|Hold on, you can’t do that, can you?
70|You can, with fried donuts.
70|Regardless of the outside, the inside is soft enough.
70|You can just press it in.
70|The inside may be soft, but the outside is hard, you know?
70|If she did something like that,
70|Boiling Water
70|Three Minutes
70|then I would’ve seen it.
70|The donut was split in two from the beginning,
70|so there would be no need to do anything to the outside.
70|Rather, the cream could act as an adhesive after the other donut was pressed in, perhaps?
70|But anyway… I don’t have any evidence.
70|Since you would have eaten the evidence, Araragi.
70|In that sense, you could say that Shinobu hid the donuts in your stomach, Araragi.
70|However, that's no good, right?
70|Wasn’t Shinobu’s objective to eat the donuts?
70|Having me eat them despite that would be putting the cart before the horse.
70|She hasn't fulfilled her objective.
70|That’s the important part, Araragi.
70|Araragi Koyomi
70|Hands Free
70|Basically,
70|abandoning her motives and personal gain.
70|Not taking into account her own self-centered opinions.
70|To put it another way, being completely selfless, even at the risk of one’s life.
70|That’s the point that Shinobu was teaching you about.
70|Araragi Koyomi
70|Hands Free
70|…Point about what, negotiations? Secrecy?
70|About love.
70|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
70|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
70|We were happy children full of curiosity,

71|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
71|as the stars twinkle above
71|I guess this is enough for me
71|I'm sure there's a reason
71|There's more to this world
71|than the things I can see
71|The reason you laugh
71|is my reason to cry
71|Getting logical and serious about this won't let us take another step
71|I'll make a wish upon that shooting star
71|Too bad I'm not sure anymore
71|what I want for the future
71|That's how we pass our days
71|Let's go to bed and to hell with making sense
71|My heart pounds

71|Hey, what are you doing now, Devil boy?
71|Look
71|look

71|Hold on, don’t mix in peace signs,

71|Anyone and everyone has something to say about my peace signs.
71|This body language.
71|And these gestures.
71|'There’s something I’m searching for at the moment,
71|so if you have time, could you help me, Devil boy?'
71|Is what it means.
71|How could I understand that?!
71|So how about it?
71|Will you help me?
71|Won't you help me? Say it clearly.
71|I do want to help you, but…
71|To be honest, the results on my mark sheet weren’t very good.
71|At this point it looks like I'll have to give myself an even harder boost.
71|Devil boy, what were you doing for the past year?
71|You should just die.
71|I won't tell you to study,
71|but you should just die.
71|Don’t try to kill me off like that.
71|As long as you won’t cooperate with helping me search,
71|I’ll continue to abuse you.
71|I’ll continue to tell you to go and die.
71|I lose. I’ll cooperate.
71|So this thing you're looking for is somewhere around here?
71|Who knows. It might not be.
71|Well, if it might not be around here, let’s keep that in mind while looking.
71|So, Ononoki. What are we looking for?
71|I'm not sure. It could be anything.
71|Yay.
71|Yay...
71|It's apparently something I'll know once I see it.
71|While we're searching, I want you to help me out...
71|by expanding my field of view.
71|Field of view?
71|Expand
71|FOV
71|I've pretty much reached my limit.
71|So I was starting to think I need a change in point of view.
71|Being as I am, by nature, an adorable doll,
71|I’m a little runt.
71|In other words I lack the height to do my searching.
71|It's true that I do have a higher point of view than you,
71|but that’s only in relative terms.
71|In absolute terms I’m not actually that tall, you know?
71|I can see that.
71|I can see that even from my low vantage point.
71|You’re absolutely not tall, Devil boy.
71|In absolute terms. Not 'absolutely.’
71|But if we add my considerably short height
71|to your fairly short height,
71|Hey presto! We end up with a pretty tall height.
71|Specifically it’ll be around three meters.
71|I see. It's the 'little girl piggyback ride' event.
71|Ononoki. There’s something I want to confirm.
71|I’m going to give you a piggyback ride, right?
71|That’s wrong, Devil boy.
71|I’m not going to piggyback on you, nor you on me.
71|Think about it, if we piggyback then there’s a big loss, isn’t there?
71|A loss?
71|Hey. It’s simple, Devil boy.
71|We just do the same thing I’ve always done.
71|Say, Ononoki, assuming we’re going to continue searching like this,
71|this thing you'll know when you see it,
71|will I be able to tell what it is once I see it, too?
71|I’ve been using up quite a lot of my vampire powers lately,
71|so if you’re expecting oddity-like eyesight,
71|I can’t really live up to that.
71|Don’t worry. I’m not expecting anything from you, Devil boy.
71|It doesn’t even have to be something suspicious for example,
71|but if anything catches your eye or seems a little weird,
71|then I should like it if you reported it to me in minute detail.
71|You should like it…
71|It’s not like I particularly have any free time right now.
71|You mean how you were only given half a year to live?
71|How much time is left, again?
71|Of your remaining life, Devil boy.
71|Which ends first, your life or your exams?
71|It’s kind of hard to say.
71|The exams themselves end first.
71|But there's the graduation ceremony in the middle,
71|and the results come out after that.
71|When you say you’ve been using up a lot of your vampire powers,
71|that’s also part of it, right?
71|Constantly repeating a useless effort, or rather, a useless defeat, haven't you?
71|It’s not useless.
71|Hey, Devil boy. What do you plan on doing from now on?
71|If you were willing,
71|it’s not like I couldn’t contact Gaen like I’ve done before.
71|However, in this situation I disobeyed her wishes when I didn't use the talisman.
71|Considering that, I can’t rely on her now.
71|Well, I've sown these seeds.
71|I will do something.
71|If you were really the one to have sown the seeds,
71|then you certainly should.
71|However, don’t you think it’s rather strange?
71|How lately, as though someone were seeking balance,
71|everything around you specifically, is in chaos.
71|It's true that once you meet an oddity, you get pulled in by them,
71|but it's almost like even that fact itself is being balanced.
71|I doubt even you are dense enough to not think it unnatural, Devil boy.
71|I am dense.
71|I'm always completely overwhelmed just trying to fix the situation.
71|Something you can tell once you see it, huh.
71|I wonder what it is?
71|Who knows?
71|If that's all I have to work with, I don’t have the slightest idea.
71|But Devil boy, there’s something that I’ve been thinking could be a possibility.
71|What is it?
71|Something that anyone could tell once they see it,
71|but once you start looking for it, you’ll lose sight of it.
71|That is...
71|A smile.
71|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
71|In the end, even though we aimlessly wandered through the town until evening,
71|we couldn’t find anything, and the result was that we didn't obtain any results.
71|A while afterwards -
71|With Tadatsuru's kidnapping of Kanbaru and my sisters,
71|and their rescue long behind us.

71|What do you think's the hardest thing to find?
71|What are you talking about?
71|I'm talking about Ononoki.
71|Araragi, Ononoki ended up living with you, right?
71|So I thought it'd be okay to tell you.
71|Hanekawa Tsubasa
71|Hands Free
71|What do you think's the hardest thing to find?
71|Err, let's see. The hardest thing to find that I can think of...
71|Well, the question is just a preface,
71|so it doesn’t really matter what you think or what you answer.
71|Then what do you plan on asking after this preface?
71|Hanekawa Tsubasa
71|Hands Free
71|'What do you think's the easiest thing to find?'
71|In that case, I guess it’s 'something you can tell once you see it.’
71|No, no, Araragi.
71|Don’t get tied up by those words so much.
71|Because that was just a lie.
71|Araragi Koyomi
71|Hands Free
71|A lie?
71|Well, 'lie' might be an exaggeration.
71|Ononoki wasn’t searching for anything.
71|The hardest thing to find would be, well, exactly that.
71|You can't find that which doesn’t exist.
71|Are you saying that Ononoki, because she wanted to play with me,
71|came up with such an innocent lie?
71|Hanekawa Tsubasa
71|Hands Free
71|Not at all.
71|Quickly
71|Denied
71|The answer is 'the easiest thing to find',
71|Of course, something that’s easy to find is something that stands out,
71|and there is nothing that stands out more than a person
71|who is searching for something.
71|You’d stop walking, look around, crouch over, or stand on your tiptoes.
71|It's utterly suspicious behavior.
71|Searching while standing tall on the finger of a doll-like girl
71|would stand out a lot.
71|Conspicuous
71|Obtrusive
71|Basically, Ononoki's intentions were to have you stand out, Araragi.
71|So that’s why she was hoisting you up like a flag.
71|But, why would Ononoki want to have me stand out?
71|Wasn't there someone in town in January who you absolutely should not have met?
71|It would’ve been bad if you ran into him, and he didn’t want to run into you either.
71|Well, we did run into each other in the end.
71|Since he was visiting the town on a daily basis,
71|then, well, it wouldn’t have been strange if you both up crossed paths at some point.
71|So most likely, at a point where that was likely to happen,
71|Ononoki was there to stop you.
71|By making you stand out, Araragi, it made it easier for the other side to avoid you.
71|Araragi Koyomi
71|Hands Free
71|By making me look for something that couldn’t be found,
71|I was made easy to find…
71|So as that the con man and I—
71|didn’t encounter each other.
71|For Ononoki,
71|she didn’t want to make you any more worried than you were at that time,
71|I'm sure.
71|When situations go without incident - no trouble and no tale to tell, surprisingly,
71|it's because it's helped along by someone's thoughtful consideration.
71|Araragi Koyomi
71|Hands Free
71|Without noticing what was supporting my peaceful life,
71|my saying that I must do something about it
71|is indeed kind of funny now.
71|That explains why she ridicules me.
71|Maybe.
71|'People can only be helped by themselves' is quite the saying,
71|but in actuality, it’s impossible for people to live on their own.
71|Well…
71|That may be true.
71|Although normally you live your life without any consciousness of that.
71|That’s right.
71|Perhaps it's that kind of nonchalant consideration
71|that's the hardest thing to find of all.
71|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
71|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
71|We were happy children full of curiosity,
71|I was the one who pushed you forward,
71|from that day onward.
71|Let's escape our confines
71|and take our time along the way
71|Let's ride our bikes to far away
71|carrying our hopes and dreams in the basket
71|Is the future we heard so many rumors about,
71|A nice place to be?
71|Even if we ask our extending shadows about it,
71|we'll still be none the wiser

72|A lot of things have hit a stopping point for me,
72|so I thought maybe I'd see if I could get some training from you, Kagenui.
72|I was thinking it'd be nice if, the next time I'm met with a difficult situation,
72|I could deal with it as deftly as you, and without relying on my vampirism.
72|Oh, I see. That's what this is about.
72|But you should probably give up on that.
72|If you were to try and learn my technique from me like this in live battle practice,
72|you would die before you learned it.
72|Just why exactly do you think I've sent Yotsugi to invade your house?
72|For a little while at least,
72|I've made it so that you should be able to go without being bothered by oddity affairs.
72|It's just that, it's a little painful going about my day to day life protected by two little girls.
72|And that is exactly why you can't carelessly make a move, now isn't it?
72|It's the same for them, too.
72|In any case, you shouldn't be doing extreme things like trying to learn anything from me.
72|Why did you get involved with oddities and ghost stories, Kagenui?
72|It probably started back in kindergarten, when I punched some irritating kid.
72|Thinking about it now, that brat might have been possessed by some awful thing or another, too.
72|Well, that was from back before I specialized in immortal oddities.
72|So, the reason you specialize in taking on immortal oddities now,
72|is because it's impossible to overdo it, right?
72|Turning that around, that would mean that you've overdone it quite a lot of times before, wouldn't it?
72|Is your profession perhaps based on this?
72|I suppose you could say that.
72|You sure have a lot of questions.
72|What, do you want me to join as well?
72|To the fabled 'Araragi harem' or whatever you call it.
72|Why does she know about that?!
72|Er, no. No such scandalous organization actually exists.
72|It'd be nice if I could become enough of a big-shot to woo you.
72|Though right now I'm more worried about staying human than getting big.
72|Don't worry, if you do lose your humanity, I'll be here to beat you to death.
72|Hey, Kagenui?
72|Ash
72|What is it?
72|How are you and Ononoki related to each other?
72|My relationship with Yotsugi?
72|As you already know, I'm the exorcist and she is my familiar.
72|But, well, Ononoki does refer to you as 'big sister,' now doesn't she?
72|She does.
72|So, I was wondering if you two had a kind of sisterly relationship or something.
72|If you're gonna say that, it's like this:
72|She says big brother when referring to you, too, doesn't she?
72|She says big brother and big sister when referring to most people.
72|Big brother Oshino
72|Big brother Kaiki
72|Yes... but,
72|she calls you just 'big sister.'
72|Well, aren't you the perceptive fellow.
72|Or maybe you have good intuition?
72|Well, it's not really something worth hiding,
72|and it wouldn't really matter if I told you,
72|but being asked so formally makes me not want to tell you, somehow.
72|Then, you won't tell me?
72|No, I'm not saying I won't.
72|I also won't charge or put you to work,
72|so you can rest easy on that front.
72|Okay then,
72|how about a continuation of our battle?
72|Just one shot.
72|If you manage to land just one shot while matched against me,
72|I'll tell you then.
72|Yotsugi's true identity.
72|Magical incantation
72|And so that's why, Karen, it's your turn.
72|Um, what exactly do you mean by 'that's why'?
72|I-can't-talk-about-the-details,
72|but-there's-this-person-who's-strong-as-an-ox.
72|so-strong-that-I'm-utterly-powerless-against-them,
72|but-I-want-to-land-a-punch-on-them.
72|Is there anything I can do?
72|who
72|exactly
72|does
72|my
72|brother
72|think
72|I am?
72|I am a martial artist who walks the path of martial arts.
72|Even if I knew a method to practice violence, there's no way I'd teach it to an amateur like you, bro.
72|Don't talk like that.
72|I'll fondle your breasts anytime you like from now on.
72|Oh, really? Well, with a condition like that, then I am also prepared to concede...
72|Nothing!
72|There is no time when I'd like to get my breasts fondled by my brother!
72|Think about it, Karen.
72|Having your breasts fondled by your brother when you'd like,
72|vs. having your breasts fondled when you'd wouldn't like.
72|Which is better?
72|Oh! I'd prefer getting fondled when I'd like!
72|It's obvious once you compare them!
72|That's my bro, you're so smart!
72|That's my Karen.
72|You're so dumb
72|Alright, got it.
72|It's not my policy to take on apprentices, but I'll make a special exception for my bro.
72|So what would you do for example?
72|If you'd want to land a punch on a person who is clearly stronger than you, what would you do?
72|It's impossible!
72|No, seriously.
72|Under those terms, it'd be difficult to get in a punch versus that person, wouldn't it?
72|Even if it didn't have to be a clean hit.
72|It'd be difficult even to get in behind their guard, wouldn't it?
72|Yeah. I told you, I'm utterly powerless.
72|If there's such a difference in ability,
72|then you just shouldn't fight them.
72|Martial arts says you should run away.
72|Actually, from what you've told me, I'm guessing it's like this:
72|If you can land a punch on this person,
72|they'll answer a question of yours,
72|or something like that, right?
72|Yeah, exactly.
72|That's a pretty good inference coming from you, Karen.
72|Aren't you just being refused indirectly?
72|I bet you asked something insensitive.
72|So maybe you've just been driven away without being exposed to the sharp edges.
72|At some point you've started to wonder only about how to land a shot on this person
72|instead of about whether or not your question will get answered, haven't you?
72|What the?!
72|I see.
72|So that must be how Kagenui expresses her adult considerations.
72|Well in that case, what should I do in response?
72|How should I know?!
72|Think about it yourself!
72|But if it were me,
72|I'd do my best so that this person, who was so considerate of me, wouldn't lose face.
72|At the least, I'd make sure that they didn't find out that I saw through their excuse to propose the fight.
72|So as to give nonchalant concern to Kagenui
72|by way of hiding my intention to respond to her sentiment,
72|I'll need some kind of excuse for when I face her.
72|So that means I'll have to think of some way to get a shot in on her,
72|not to win against her, but to lose gracefully.
72|I'm at a complete standstill.
72|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punchline.
72|To construct a false chance of victory,
72|I basically followed the same method I took when I fought against her back in summer break.
72|As for how I confronted that,
72|I had Oshino Shinobu suck my blood, boosting the vampirism in both of us,
72|strengthening myself, and then went to confront her.
72|This time however, I couldn't use this method as-is.
72|I can't keep using my vampirism,
72|However, I can borrow Shinobu's abilites as much as I want.
72|I borrowed her ability to materialize matter,
72|and had her make me a pistol.
72|Black
72|Donuts
72|100-yen sale
72|I brought the handgun only to use as a tool for rhetoric.
72|Kagenui said 'one shot.'
72|'If you land one shot.'
72|In that case whether that shot was from a punch or a bullet shouldn't matter.
72|That's just exactly the kind of simplistic idea that a fool like me would think up.
72|And also, and this part's cruicial, it was an idea that would 100% fail.
72|An idiotic highschooler stepped up to a game and simply lost.
72|That should be the end of that.
72|A sudden response to a nonchalant concern.
72|Rather, to counteract my carelessness.
72|It should at least get a passing grade.
72|Ash
72|Huh?
72|The lifelong undefeated specialist, Kagenui Yozuru, was gone.
72|Huh?
72|To be continued
72|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,

73|Early morning, I ascended the mountain staircase to the Shrine of the Polar Snake at the summit.
73|It had already become a habit over the past month.
73|Kagenui Yozuru had disappeared from the Shrine of the Polar Snake,
73|and since then, almost a month had passed.
73|Naturally, I'm in no position to worry about Kagenui.
73|But even so I had, unhonorably, gone to the shrine every day.
73|Unhonorably isn’t even a word, is it...
73|This wasn’t good.
73|Even though I have an exam today, I'm losing confidence in myself
73|Well, at any rate, Senjougahara is going to be escorting me to the university,
73|so I 'd have to get off this mountain before our meeting time.
73|For her to think that she needed to escort me to the university,
73|wasn’t giving me a whole lot of credit…

73|Senjougahara Hitagi
73|Hands Free
73|You’re already on the path to success in terms of grades, Araragi.
73|So as long as you can avoid any trouble that keeps you from taking the exam itself,
73|then the campus life is already in sight.
73|A month was about to pass uneventfully, without anything happening.
73|Without any oddities.
73|No urban legends.
73|No street gossip.
73|No idle rumors.
73|And naturally, no school ghost stories, nothing.
73|As if everything had ended.
73|Gaen.
73|Hey, Koyomin, good morning.
73|Good morning.
73|Your body. It’s gotten pretty serious, hasn’t it? Koyomin.
73|Well… It’s something that’s still manageable.
73|I suppose, what’s gotten pretty serious would be...
73|Yozuru.
73|To think that she would be targeted.
73|Really, it was unexpected. Even for me.
73|Aren’t you supposed to be able to expect anything?
73|You know everything, don’t you?
73|Woah woah, what’s with the sarcasm towards a friend you haven’t seen in a while, Koyomin?
73|As for why Kagenui was elimiated, It’s because she was simply in the way.
73|Not Kagenui Yozuru herself, but her familair, Ononoki Yotsugi.
73|In order to render her powerless and ineffective,
73|the master was taken care of instead.
73|By taking out the master, the top of the chain of command,
73|there'd be no need to be afraid of that posed look girl.
73|Sending Yotsugi into your home, Koyomin,
73|although she is capable of protecting you as a genuine manmade oddity,
73|it seemed there was someone who didn’t particularly like that.
73|Well, even so, that person wouldn’t make a move on Yotsugi herself since she is a genuine oddity.
73|That’s why she went after her master instead.
73|From here, the story can diverge into two possible paths.
73|Yotsugi remains a powerless, meaningless bodyguard just as it was planned,
73|or somehow, Yotsugi awakens to human nature and ends up protecting Koyomin of her own free will…
73|Though she would lose sight of the oddity part of her.
73|As for what would happen if she lost sight of the oddity part of her,
73|I don’t need to explain it to you, do I?
73|Since you should’ve seen it with your own eyes.
73|If that happened.
73|If Ononoki Yotsugi stopped being a genuine oddity,
73|she would be something that you could lay a hand on, and you wouldn’t need to fear her.
73|What was the reason for going so far?
73|It felt like they were trying to keep me from doing something…
73|Or were they trying to get me to do something?
73|Is Shinobu...
73|sleeping soundly at the moment, Koyomin?
73|Yes…
73|She’s been completely nocturnal recently.
73|She’s usually asleep around this time, at least.
73|Well, it does sound like something she might think of.
73|Trying to draw closer to the essence of being an oddity, in case an emergency happens.
73|Although, it doesn’t have much meaning, since she’s already started to stray from being an oddity.
73|The Kissshot-Acerolaorion-Heartunderblade of right now,
73|who is no longer completely immortal or completely a vampire,
73|at any rate, cannot protect you twenty-four hours a day.
73|So you aren’t really protected against assassination.
73|As a comparison,
73|it’s almost as absurd as trying to win in Shogi without having any of your pieces taken.
73|Even if you’re a proud, passionate commander, there are still pieces that must be sacrificed.
73|…If you try to protect a pawn, you’ll lose your king, is what you’re saying?
73|The rook, the bishop, the gold general or the silver general,
73|they’ll all possible sacrifies in the end.
73|The only piece that can’t be sacrificed is the king.
73|If you think about it, it’s a strange game.
73|Even if all the pieces except for the king are taken,
73|as long as the king survives, you can still win.
73|Anyway, Koyomin.
73|Do you believe yourself to be the king?
73|Ah, no, impossible.
73|Right? You’re very modest like that.
73|Right now, as for this town's king,
73|there isn't one.
73|Right now, the throne is vacant, in this town, that’s why so many problems are occurring.
73|It’s like a game of shogi without the king.
73|I’ve heard of games where you play without the rook or the bishop,
73|but it’s unusual to play shogi without the king, right?
73|How would you decide who the victor is then?
73|In such a case, there is no winner or loser, is there?
73|Since there are no conditions for victory or defeat.
73|That’s right, it’s a situation with no winner or loser.
73|People would call that a lawless zone.
73|Vacant.
73|As I recall, the one who said that for a chaotic state to arise, a void is needed, was Kaiki.
73|Oshino was able to bring spiritual stability to the town despite the vacancy.
73|What I want to do is fill up that vacancy, if by appearance only.
73|I entrusted that to you, Koyomin, and you failed.
73|That’s how it’s been so far, correct?
73|Really, I had hoped that putting Yotsugi close to you as a restraint would work.
73|But it doesn’t seem to have worked.
73|Kagenui has gone missing.
73|Kaiki isn’t showing his face.
73|And Oshino’s whereabouts is unknown...
73|so we're at an impasse.
73|I had no choice but to act personally.
73|…What do you mean by act?
73|This situation where the collaterol damage keeps increasing. I'd like to put a lid on it, Koyomin.
73|So instead of saying I was going to act, I could say I’d like to put an end to these actions,
73|specifically, Koyomin, your actions.
73|Mine? Um, it’s not like I… planned to act or anything.
73|Isn’t that why Kagenui sent Ononoki to me?
73|But Yotsugi is no longer able to carry out that job.
73|She can no longer protect you, and she can’t stop you, either.
73|Quite literally a dummy.

73|So now you're able to act.
73|You’re already able to act— and there’s no one that can stop you.
73|And the problem is, if you act—
73|the other side will act too.
73|The other side?
73|You don’t have to think about who the other side is.
73|In short,
73|'someone.'
73|The problem is, it’s dangerous for you to act.
73|Or rather, the other side is waiting for you to act.
73|It’s a duel-like situation where the first to act becomes the loser.
73|Almost a dilemma.
73|A dilemma…
73|between what, exactly?
73|I can see a resolution strategy for it, but carrying it out is a little painful.
73|A resolution strategy…?
73|A resolution strategy for what?
73|It’s a resolution strategy to dispel the 'darkness’ that’s been enveloping this town.
73|And so the answer is...
73|for you to die.
73|Don’t worry, it’ll only hurt for a moment.
73|That sword. It resembled something I knew.
73|The sword she swung was...
73|the real thing.
73|Supposedly long since vanished...
73|The original Oddity Slayer.
73|That it came to this is a shame.
73|It was as Senjougahara had said.
73|For a guy like me, rather than the exam itself,
73|being able to arrive at the exam was the bigger barrier.
73|And at that, I had failed.

73|I kick a stone away to get rid of my worries,
73|I'm downplaying the flutter I feel this April.
73|We were happy children full of curiosity,
73|I was the one who pushed you forward,
73|from that day onward.
73|Let's escape our confines
73|and take our time along the way
73|Let's ride our bikes to far away
73|carrying our hopes and dreams in the basket
73|Is the future we heard so many rumors about,
73|A nice place to be?
73|Even if we ask our extending shadows about it,
73|we'll still be none the wiser
73|Now for the epilogue, or rather, the punch line.
73|Huh?
73|What is this?
73|What's going on?
73|Hadn't Gaen swung the Oddity Slayer,
73|and sliced me to pieces with it?
73|What exactly was going on?
73|No.
73|Gaen, what had she done?
73|Ah. You're awake?
73|Or perhaps, is this a case of not being able to let sleeping dogs lie, Rarabai?
73|Don’t say my name like some kind of lullaby.
73|My name is Araragi—
73|I see. Sorry, I stuttered.
73|It was a bright smile that I had liked,
73|that I had loved, once before.
73|Yearned for. I never expected to it see again.
73|So, is the punch line that Araragi couldn’t make it to the exam location, and failed the entrance exam?
73|No, a punch line like that wouldn’t work at all!

74|Since I've had multiple last names,
74|I can't look to my name for an identity.
74|Not in the slightest.
74|One of the biggest reasons I have yet to face myself
74|might be the fact that I don't see my name as my own.
74|So, I must start by learning everything there is to know about my name.
74|Only then will I be able to define who I am.
74|This is a story to let you know that while Araragi puts me on a pedestal, speaking of me as some kind of saint,
74|I am only human.
74|One to let you know that I'm a cat, a tiger,
74|and only human.

74|Oh?
74|So, what are you up to?
74|I forgot something at Araragi's place,
74|so I'm trying to have it returned to me.
74|Forgot something?
74|See?
74|I got apprehended by him yesterday
74|and carelessly left my backpack behind.

74|It was totally by force!
74|And now you've made it sound more like a crime.

74|But he'd apparently gone out already.
74|His bike was nowhere to be seen.
74|Oh...

74|You're right...
74|"Somehow managed to escape"?
74|I think I'll just ignore that statement, which sounds rather ominous in its own right.
74|Okay, I'll tell Araragi you're looking for him if I run into him at school.
74|I'd greatly appreciate it!
74|Well, then.
74|See you soon, Hanekawa.

74|Yep. A tiger, not a cat.
74|Not a tiger-striped cat?
74|Nope. A tiger-striped tiger.
74|You saw a tiger?
74|Don't you think that's a rather big deal?
74|I do, but it's not what you think.
74|I believe it was probably an oddity and not a real tiger.
74|It could even talk.
74|You'd be better off talking to Araragi about it, then.
74|I have encountered a crab oddity before,

74|but I possess neither the methods to deal with them
74|nor the knowledge required to do so. Not more than a layman would, anyway.
74|But it looks like Araragi took the day off today.
74|Huh?
74|He didn't attend the opening ceremony?
74|Not being noticed is one thing,

74|Something, huh?
74|Did you try calling or texting him?
74|Nah, I couldn't bring myself to.
74|Hanekawa, you could afford to be a bit more shameless about things.
74|Shameless?
74|Or should I say, bold?
74|No matter what the circumstances, he wouldn't mind if you relied on him.
74|But you already know that, don't you?
74|Who knows?
74|Maybe I don't.

74|Have you ever asked Araragi to help you?
74|I dunno.

74|Oh. Neither have I.
74|Not like we have many chances to do so, considering he ends up helping us before we ask.
74|All while spouting garbage like "people have to save themselves."
74|But keep in mind that while he may help you before you ask,
74|that doesn't mean you shouldn't.
74|What do you mean?
74|Well, I was just wondering if you were expecting Araragi to help you without you having to ask.
74|Oh...
74|I think you should just rely on him.
74|That's what he's wanted all along.
74|If you'd been able to do that back during Golden Week...
74|We should get back to class.
74|Yeah.
74|I'm not going to force you to do anything,
74|but don't try to take everything on by yourself.
74|You still haven't been cured of that habit.
74|If you want to avoid getting Araragi into trouble,

74|This led to us Hanekawas having our first conversation in a while.

74|Gee, thanks. I had to run all over town as a result.
74|I asked around and found out that you were staying over at a friend's place.
74|But I didn't hear about any of our classmates having you over.
74|Just how many people did you ask?

74|That's why I came here last.
74|Scene no. 334

74|Now that you mention it, I realize how much danger I was putting myself in.
74|They say "don't play with fire or you'll get burned,"
74|but I think my sense of reason burned down with the house.
74|Not to mention you met a tiger.
74|Either way, I certainly did go a bit overboard.

74|You're right. I didn't, but...
74|Look at that bed head.
74|Let's not talk about that!
74|Taking the second day of the new term off would seem really strange.
74|Showing up at school like nothing happened the day after your house burned down would be even worse.
74|You have much to learn if you don't even realize that.

74|I'm just about to take a shower, though.
74|Oh.

74|Yeah, thanks.

74|Senjougahara's character was changing.
74|I beg of you, Hanekawa.
74|Please take a shower with me.
74|All right.
74|You're right in that I don't feel that opposed to it since we're both girls.
74|Oh, I didn't expect you to agree.
74|This is a bit hard to say after I asked,
74|but I figured you weren't the sort to cross that line, even with a friend.
74|What's that supposed to mean?
74|Like not letting people into my room, or refusing to hang out with them outside school?
74|Yes.
74|I won't deny it.
74|But I can't justify keeping my distance from a girl who just slapped me with tears streaming down her face.
74|Who is it?
74|Araragi.
74|Judging by the contents, I think you probably got the same text as well.
74|From: Araragi
74|No subject
74|I can't return home for a while. Don't vorry.
74|Looks like he's at it again.
74|And it seems quite serious this time.
74|I don't exactly know what happened back then,
74|but looking at this text, things are probably just as bad as spring break, if not worse.
74|You think so too?
74|for a while. Don't vorry.
74|Yeah.
74|Though, well, I guess he's matured a little if he can send such messages.
74|He used to be unable to see anything that wasn't directly in front of him.
74|Scene no. 433
74|Is it related to Mayoi?
74|Yeah.
74|Nope.
74|I tried calling him, but I couldn't get through.
74|Well, he's a guy. We don't have to worry about him too much.
74|Very well.
74|When he gets back, I'll brag to him about how I took a shower with you.
74|How is that supposed to make him feel bad?
74|I'll tell him your figure was like this,
74|and that parts of your body were like that...
74|maybe.
74|Enough with the gestures already!
74|But this means we'll have to deal with the tiger ourselves.
74|Tiger?
74|But that was...
74|I was thinking that maybe it was the one responsible for burning your house down.
74|Was I mistaken?
74|Do you know what caused it?
74|No, it's hard to say what did.
74|I don't know.
74|I see. Guess I was just jumping the gun again.
74|Scene no. 450
74|Like the ex-runner I am. Get it?
74|Scene no. 452
74|The posed look on your face makes the joke even worse.
74|Come now, Hanekawa.
74|Let's take a shower good enough for both us and Araragi.
74|I don't think we need to.
74|I'll take a look at your body good enough for both Araragi and me.
74|Good enough for you is more than enough!
74|Scene no. 454
74|Let's be nice and wash each other's breasts, then.
74|Don't you mean "each other's backs"?
74|Hey, Hanakawa.
74|Just when I'd begun taking my uniform off in a hurry,
74|Senjouhara asked me a question that came out of nowhere.
74|Do you still love Araragi?
74|Yep.
74|I still do.
74|Scene no. 463
74|I answered without hesitation.
74|Let's feel each other's heartbeat
74|and tell each other of our feelings without lies
74|A normal Friday
74|is part of a series of days full of doubts and regrets
74|I try to think of a plan
74|to tell you of my love, but suddenly the day is over
74|I get so insecure when your eyes drift away
74|I don't want to wind up being super jealous
74|You know, I wish it was just us two
74|Don't laugh at my innocent words of love
74|Like I'd ever give up on you again
74|I desperately look for an answer
74|It's so ridiculous
74|Let's look into each other's eyes
74|discard our fear
74|and try explaining our feelings
74|Let's take a deep breath and try again

75|The name "Hanekawa Tsubasa" is already very unstable.
75|Animation Number 6
75|My surname has changed several times already.
75|That's why I cannot seek a sense of identity in it.
75|None. Not at all.
75|A large reason why I haven't been able to face myself till now,
75|is the fact that I did not acknowledge my name as something of my own.
75|So I should first learn my name.
75|Only then will I be able to define who I am for the first time.
75|This story is for you to learn that despite Araragi-kun's exaggerations about me being a saint
75|I am nothing more than just another human.
75|This is for you to know that I am a cat, a tiger, and a human.
75|This is a story of betrayal for you all to become disappointed in me.

75|Well, look at that.
75|Animation Number 80
75|The girl: Hachikuji Mayoi
75|If it isn't Hanekawa-san!
75|It seems you're starting school today, Hanekawa-san?
75|That's right.
75|To devote oneself to academics is another form of heavy labor.
75|I'm still just in grade school,
75|but I've been devoting myself to overcome many troublesome obstacles.
75|I see...
75|What are you doing, Mayoi-chan?
75|I forgot something at Araragi-san's house, so I wanted to get it back from him.
75|Forgot something?
75|See?
75|He dragged me away last night. After that, I inadvertently forgot my backpack.
75|Dragged?
75|Dragged against my will.
75|That sounds more like a crime.
75|Animation Number 101
75|If I asked once more, "apprehension" might turn into "assault"
75|But can't you just go to Araragi-kun's house?
75|Of course that was the first place I went.
75|But it seemed he already left. His bicycle wasn't there.
75|Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
75|Really?
75|If he left his house early in the morning, he might have had something really important before school,
75|or maybe it's already been taken care of,
75|Animation Number 107
75|Maybe he didn't
75|Animation Number 107
75|leave home early,
75|and maybe Araragi-kun hasn't returned home at all since last night.
75|Animation Number 107
75|he hasn't yet
75|Animation Number 107
75|returned home?
75|Oh, I didn't think about that! As expected of Hanekawa-san.
75|Perhaps after I managed to escape from Araragi-san's house, some unavoidable catastrophe befell him.
75|Right.
75|I'm going to let the unavoidably disturbing phrase "managed to escape" slide here...
75|Well, if I see Araragi-kun at school, I'll tell him you were looking for him, Mayoi-chan.
75|Please do.
75|Well then! I'll be seeing you again soon, Hanekawa-san!
75|Yup! See you!
75|My episode with him will be in the next title!

75|By the way, Hanekawa-san, am I obligated to listen to that story in detail?
75|Animation Number 161
75|detailed
75|Purple Scene
75|Animation Number 'none'
75|Was your "listen up" a serious plea instead of a mere preface?
75|You said tiger, Hanekawa-san? Not a cat?
75|A tiger, not a cat.
75|Not a cat in tiger stripes?
75|Yup. A tiger in tiger stripes.
75|You saw a tiger. Don't you think that's a huge incident?
75|I do, but it's not like that.
75|It's not a tiger in real life. I think it's an aberration since it talked.
75|In that case, I think you're better off talking to Araragi-kun than to me.
75|It's true I encountered a crab aberration before,
75|Animation Number 175
75|and suffered quite a lot because of it too
75|Animation Number 175
75|but
75|but I don't know how to combat it, nor do I possess more knowledge than others.
75|But Araragi-kun seems to be absent today.
75|He wasn't in line for the term's opening ceremony?
75|To go unnoticed when absent... That's even less of an existence than going unnoticed when you're there.
75|Animation Number 180
75|laughed she.
75|Animation Number 180
75|It made me shiver.
75|I met Mayoi-chan right before seeing that tiger this morning.
75|From what she said, it seems he's up to something right now after all.
75|Something, huh?
75|Did you try calling or texting?
75|I've been hesitating.
75|I see. I think you can be a bit more impudent about things.
75|Impudent?
75|Perhaps "audacious"?
75|That boy will never consider you relying on him bothersome, no matter what.
75|You know this, right?
75|I'm not so sure.
75|I guess I don't know that much.
75|Hanekawa-san, have you ever said "help me" to Araragi-kun?
75|I don't know. Probably not.
75|I see. I haven't either. He helps us before we have the chance to.
75|Acting like a know-it-all, saying people just help themselves on their own.
75|But I don't think it's all right to not say anything just because he helps us, without us saying a word.
75|What's that?
75|Well, I was just thinking that perhaps you're expecting Araragi-kun to help you before you say anything.
75|Ah...
75|I think you can be honest and just rely on him. He's always wanted that.
75|If you had been able to do that back during Golden Week...
75|Should we head back?
75|Sure.
75|I won't force you, but if something happens, don't think about trying to solve it alone.
75|You have a strong tendency to, so if you don't want to trouble Araragi-kun, get me involved.
75|Let's see... I can die together with you at least.
75|A fire.
75|Animation Number 229
75|I said it.
75|My house is on fire.
75|Animation Number 231
75|I called
75|Animation Number 231
75|that house
75|Animation Number 231
75|my own.
75|The house burning down was more shocking than I thought.
75|Enough for my mind to go completely blank.
75|Animation Number 237
75|I was dumbfounded.
75|It was a devastating shock.
75|With this, the Hanekawa family had its first conversation in a while.
75|What was discussed this day was, "Where to sleep this evening?"
75|I said, "I'll be all right. I'll sleep over at a friend's place for a while."
75|My parents immediately consented.
75|100 yen
75|However, this put me in a tough spot. I'm probably completely unable to seek help from another person.
75|Well, I'll be fine. Luckily I know where to go.
75|Animation Number 247
75|And
75|Animation Number 247
75|that "where" is of course

75|Animation Number 266
75|I was trying to make my thoughts coherent
75|Animation Number 266
75|even though I realized the contradiction.
75|Animation Number 266
75|So typical of me.
75|Thank you for that meal.
75|I can't say it was nice to sleep on,
75|but strangely, I felt I slept more soundly than in the hallway at my house.
75|Hmm, did I just skip a chapter?
75|Is it just me? Oh well.
75|Hanekawa-san!
75|You're all right? You're alive?
75|Huh? What? Good morning?
75|You're all right?
75|Y-Yeah...
75|You idiot!
75|Idiot!
75|Animation Number 303
75|It didn't hurt at all.
75|A-A girl sleeping all alone in a place like this!
75|What would you have done if something had happened!
75|Animation Number 303
75|Yet it hurt a lot.
75|I'm sorry.
75|Animation Number 304
75|Animation Number 306
75|Or rather, I was forced to apologize.
75|No, I won't forgive you. I'll never forgive you.
75|I won't forgive you. Even if you apologize, I'll never forgive you.
75|Yeah. I get it. I get it now.
75|I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
75|Animation Number 311
75|I called you numerous times last night. But I couldn't get through at all.
75|Oh, sorry about that. I had turned it off.
75|Because of that, I ended up running all over town.
75|I talked to all sorts of people and finally heard you were staying at a friend's house.
75|But I didn't hear anyone say they had you over.
75|H-How many people did you talk to?
75|I set up a mailing group.
75|Or rather, I'm sorry. I met your parents, Hanekawa-san.
75|I see. So you met Father and Mother, Senjougahara-san?
75|I don't think you have to call people like that "Father" and "Mother," do you?
75|Animation Number 323
75|said Senjougahara nonchalantly.
75|Animation Number 323
75|Quite nonchalantly.
75|It seems you've got a lot going on. I don't intend to pry though.
75|Animation Number 326
75|And now for something completely different
75|After that, I aimlessly searched around and finally thought of this place in the morning.
75|Mitsüi Logistics
75|No, I thought of it from the start,
75|but I didn't want to think an adolescent girl could spend the night in a place like this.
75|So I thought, "Impossible. Most impossible of impossibles." That's why I looked here last.
75|Animation Number 334
75|That's why I got so worked up that I even cried when I found you.
75|Th-Then could it be Senjougahara-san stayed up all night?
75|It's not "could it be." Senjougahara-san did.
75|Animation Number 336
75|After a sleepless night, everything's alright.
75|I think it's also dangerous for a girl to run around the streets all night.
75|Animation Number 338
75|Though to be correct that should be "all right."
75|I have no comeback for that.
75|I'm not the type who thinks things through much either.
75|Thank you.
75|It's fine. It's something I did on my own.
75|Looking at your state, it seems meddling got me nowhere.
75|That's not true.
75|I finally realized just how dangerous what I did was after you told me.
75|It's said fire makes people crazy, so I think I was in a strange tense state from it.
75|Well, you had that thing with the tiger too. I was a bit too worried about you.
75|Sorry to get all shaken up about you.
75|Well, shall we get going?
75|Get going? Where? School?
75|My place.
75|I'll declare this up front. If you resist in any way,
75|I'll shove a stapler in your mouth and staple your neck, if that's what it takes, Hanekawa-san.
75|Father won't be home because of work, so you should stay the night.

75|Let's climb the stairs quietly
75|Oh, it's all right?
75|201
75|Actually, my parents won't be coming home tonight.
75|Why'd you rephrase it into a line from a romantic comedy?
75|Despite this, I once lived in a mansion.
75|Back then, I could've easily tossed you into an extra room, but this is all I can do now.
75|Don't say it like Lupin.
75|This calms me down somehow.
75|Really?
75|Something about this place feels good.
75|Almost feels like my own home.
75|In the first place, what is "my home" anyway?
75|Hanekawa-san, you should stay home from school today. I'll stay home with you.
75|Huh?
75|I'm terribly sleepy, as expected.
75|Animation Number 376
75|The bed is waiting for us
75|I was into track, but it's been too long, so my legs and back are a mess.
75|There's no way you slept well there, right?
75|Well, um, I guess not...
75|And your bed head's awful.
75|Don't talk about bed head!
75|But it's only the second day of the second semester. I can't possibly be absent from school.
75|It's way more abnormal for a girl whose house burned down to cheerfully attend school the next day.
75|Things like that are why you're not street-smart.
75|You don't plan to go to college anyway, right?
75|Then you don't really have to worry about things like attendance or conduct.
75|Well, you're right, but...
75|Animation Number 387
75|But the rules...
75|Animation Number 387
75|I want to follow the rules.
75|Animation Number 387
75|Because they're rules.
75|That's enough. Rest.
75|If you must go to school, you need to defeat me first.
75|Sha kin~
75|Don't mouth off your own sound effects!
75|Animation Number 390
75|Okay, okay. I'll do as you say today, Senjougahara-san.
75|To be honest, I do want to rest.
75|I'm glad you're forcing me.
75|If you say so. It's not really like me to be a busybody.
75|But is it all right for you to be absent from school too?
75|Well, let's see...
75|This is Senjou... Senjougahara.
75|I-It seems like I caught off-season influenza.
75|Is it all right to go to school?
75|I shouldn't? That's a shame. I really wanted to attend your class.
75|Then excuse me.
75|There we go.
75|Influenza? You didn't have to go that far. A common cold would've been fine.
75|Bigger lies are harder to catch.
75|Could you put some clothes on already, Senjougahara-san?
75|But I was going to take a shower.
75|Oh, I see.
75|You too right?
75|Yeah, I would like to. Of course you can go first.
75|Why are you treating me like a stranger? Let's take one together.
75|We're both women. There's no shame in it.
75|Wait, hold on a minute. No, longer! I sense a threatening atmosphere...
75|Oh no. I have no ulterior motives.
75|Or can't you trust your friends, Hanekawa-san?
75|I don't think I can trust a friend saying that in this situation.
75|Don't get me wrong. I'm not like Kanbaru.

75|I just want to see your naked body. I'm not planning anything beyond that.
75|Animation Number 411
75|Senjougahara's character was changing.
75|Please, Hanekawa-san, come take a shower with me!
75|I guess it's all right. We're both girls, so it's not like I'm that opposed.
75|Oh, I didn't expect you to agree. I did ask,
75|but I thought you'd be someone who would never cross a line like that, even for friends.
75|What line? Like someone who won't let anyone in their room or never hangs out with anyone outside school?
75|Yes.
75|I won't deny that.
75|But it won't look good if I distance myself from the girl who slapped me while she was crying.
75|Who's that from?
75|Araragi-kun.
75|Hmm, from what's written here, I think he sent it to you too.
75|From: Araragi
75|No subject
75|I can't return home for a while. Don't vorry.
75|Looks like Araragi-kun's up to something. And this time it looks pretty serious.
75|I don't know much about spring break, but judging from these words, it looks as bad as then, if not worse.
75|You think so too?
75|for a while. Don't vorry.
75|Yes. But if he'd go out of his way to send texts like this, that's a sign of growth.
75|He used to only see what was in front of his eyes.
75|Animation Number 433
75|Is it related to Mayoi?
75|Right.
75|No good. It won't go through.
75|Well, he is a boy, so we shouldn't worry too much.
75|All right. When he comes back, I'll just gloat that I took a shower with you.
75|I don't think that kind of harassment will work.
75|Her body lines were like this, and it was like this over here. And such...
75|Stop gesturing it all out!
75|But now that means we have to handle the tiger here by ourselves.
75|Tiger?
75|But the tiger...
75|I thought the tiger might be the reason your house was on fire.
75|But it wasn't? Do you know the exact cause?
75|No, I don't know the details of that yet...
75|I don't know.
75|I see. I might be jumping to conclusions.
75|Animation Number 450
75|A hasty ex-runner. Get it?
75|Animation Number 452
75|The posed look on your face makes the joke even worse.
75|Now, Hanekawa-san, we should shower for Araragi-kun.
75|I don't think we need to do it for him.
75|I'll look over your naked body for Araragi-kun then.
75|Don't you mean for yourself?
75|Animation Number 454
75|Then let's be friendly and wash each other's breasts.
75|Don't you mean scrub each other's backs?
75|Hanekawa-san...
75|While I eagerly stripped out of my uniform, Senjougahara-san suddenly inquired...
75|Do you still love Araragi-kun?
75|Yup. I still love him.

76|This is good timing.
76|Let's talk a little about Araragi.
76|Talk about Araragi Koyomi
76|Scene no. 3
76|Araragi Koyomi, who is Senjougahara's boyfriend and my friend.
76|Scene no. 4
76|To tell you the truth, I knew of him before spring break.
76|I didn't know everything,
76|but I did know about Araragi.
76|Araragi Koyomi

76|Araragi Koyomi
76|Scene no. 9
76|Araragi was pretty famous at Naoetsu High School.
76|Frankly speaking, he actually stood out in a bad sort of way.
76|May
76|Sat Fri Thu Wed Tue Mon Sun
76|He skipped school
76|and was apathetic about classes or exams.
76|What was he doing then, you ask?
76|Apparently it was similar to what he did during spring break or Golden Week.
76|What Karen and Tsukihi do as the Fire Sisters
76|is nothing in comparison.

76|They're merely rehashing what Araragi did during his middle school years.
76|That said,
76|while there's not much of a difference in what he did then and what he does now,
76|Barely legal extracurricular activities
76|Scene no. 23
76|He fought the law
76|Scene no. 25
76|it seems to be an undeniable fact that there's a large discrepancy in his motives.
76|I'm pretty impressed he lived to become a high-schooler
76|Scene no. 25
76|What happened to him?
76|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
76|He's even more unwilling to talk about it than he is with spring break,

76|but apparently he reached a turning point back in his first year of high school.
76|I suppose you could call it "the reason he turned into a loser," like he does.
76|Either way,
76|whether he has changed or not,
76|Araragi's still himself.
76|The aloof Araragi I first met may seem like a completely different person now,
76|Private Naoetsu High School
76|but he is still himself.
76|And as proof, it looks like he's up to something as we speak.
76|I fell in love with that guy before I even knew it.
76|As for when that happened,
76|My reminiscences

76|let's save that story for another time.
76|Sorry

76|That it'd be the first and last time I did so
76|Tonight is like the color of white chocolate
76|It's too sweet, and full of lies
76|It's a fairy tale world

76|Oh my. Good morning, Hanekawa.
76|Good morning, Senjougahara.
76|Though I'm sure this isn't the right time of day for that.
76|Yeah, it isn't.
76|What time is it?
76|Uh... 1:30.

76|PM, obviously.
76|Scene no. 80
76|After what you saw last
76|Scene no. 80
76|After what you saw last, the two of us really did take a shower together.
76|Senjougahara's also the type of person who'd built a firm wall around herself.
76|Back when she was considered a sheltered princess, I can say without a doubt
76|that she would never have let me stay over or taken a shower with me.
76|Nor would she have run around town at night looking for me to begin with.
76|When I think about the weight of everything she's overcome recently,
76|I feel ashamed that I haven't been able to overcome my own problems,
76|even though I went through the same things.
76|Yeah.
76|I haven't overcome a thing.
76|Despite everything I went through during Golden Week
76|and on the eve of the cultural festival,
76|I haven't matured at all.
76|I haven't changed at all.
76|That's why I felt very envious of Senjougahara.
76|That's why I like her, and am basically incapable of hating her.
76|I felt that way, honestly.
76|After that
76|Scene no. 109
76|Senjougahara and I had half an hour of fun in the shower, and then, feeling refreshed,
76|Scene no. 109
76|we went to the dressing room.
76|Scene no. 109
76|I'm sure you're not very keen on wearing my underwear,
76|but please, Hanekawa, borrow my pajamas at least.
76|As for those obviously cheap sweats with a design that'd send a stupa into a stupor,
76|I'll throw them away for you.
76|Huh?
76|What?
76|They're bad?
76|More like awful!

76|Ionized
76|So Hanekawa, have you decided to grow your hair back out after all?
76|Well, yeah.
76|I haven't gone to a salon since I got rid of it.
76|Going long again?
76|Hmm... I dunno.
76|I only realized this after cutting it short,
76|but surprisingly enough, long hair was easier to maintain.
76|Ionized
76|I suppose that might actually be true.
76|We still have my dad's mattress, but I'm not sure we should use it.
76|Making a high school girl sleep on a middle-aged man's mattress just doesn't seem right to me.
76|Guess we have no choice.
76|Sleep with me, Hanekawa.
76|It's okay. It's all right. It's all good.
76|Relax, I won't do a thing.
76|We'll only sleep on the same bed.
76|I won't lay a finger on you.
76|I'm beginning to understand how you can go out with Araragi.
76|Scene no. 174
76|Hanekawa, I swear I won't use you as a body pillow!
76|It's all right, I get it.
76|No big deal. I wasn't worried to begin with.
76|Really?
76|Thanks.
76|Then you can use my pillow, Hanekawa.
76|I'll use my dad's.
76|What if you were to sleep in your dad's bed?
76|That's not an option. If I did that, I wouldn't be able to sleep with you.
76|I see.
76|Also, I actually have an Electra complex,
76|so whenever I lie down on my dad's bed,
76|I get too aroused to sleep.
76|That's way too much information, Senjougahara.

76|Let's climb the stairs quietly
76|While you might have the chance to say "good morning" to a Roomba,
76|you'd never get the chance to say "good night."
76|Scene no. 199
76|1:30 PM, huh?
76|Looks like we slept quite a while.
76|Did you only just wake up now too?
76|Yeah, something like that.
76|I never thought I'd see the day where I woke up lying next to you.
76|Enough with the pillow talk, please.
76|I usually sleep lightly since I'm always on edge,
76|but for some reason I slept quite well.
76|Hmm... Was it because of the pillow?
76|Now, then.
76|Are you hungry, Hanekawa?
76|Let's have breakfa—
76|Er, I was thinking of making some lunch.
76|Sounds good.
76|I gratefully accept.
76|Anything you don't like to eat?
76|Nope.
76|That so?
76|By the way, Hanekawa.
76|Did you know that adding titles to certain foods makes them sound really silly?
76|Scene no. 201
76|Mr. Bean
76|Ever since I found out about it, I've really, really enjoyed eating beans.
76|Well, it doesn't actually make them taste different.
76|Then what about this?
76|Doesn't it mean that calling someone a "beansprout" is a big compliment?
76|Scene no. 208
76|Do you cook, Hanekawa?
76|I do.
76|I cook all my meals myself.
76|Oh, really? I did that for a while too.
76|Let's eat.
76|This is great!
76|Really?
76|Araragi didn't seem too happy with it,
76|so I was expecting some harsh criticism.
76|Harsh criticism?
76|I think it's delicious.
76|Though, of course, everyone's tastes are different.
76|So basically, you and I have similar tastes.
76|Similar taste in food,
76|and similar taste in men.
76|Scene no. 235
76|Oh my, how bad-mannered of me.
76|Senjougahara...
76|You're way too straightforward.
76|Well, I figured it'd be best to talk about things like this
76|if I truly wanted to break the ice with you.
76|Well, you're walking on thin ice here!
76|Scene no. 238
76|She's such a daredevil.
76|How about this then, Senjougahara?
76|Let's go all out and tell each other what we like about Araragi.
76|I don't know about that.
76|He'd let it go to his head if he found out about it, so I don't think it's worth discussing.
76|What should we talk about, then?
76|Let's tell each other what we hate about Araragi.
76|You're on.
76|Scene no. 246
76|I think it's about time we talked about what to do.
76|What do you mean?
76|I mean what you're going to do from now on.
76|Assuming you stay here tonight,
76|what'll you do from tomorrow?
76|Do you have any ideas?
76|No,
76|I don't.
76|I see.
76|Honestly speaking, I'd like you to stay a lot longer.
76|But as you can see, the Senjougahara residence is quite cramped.
76|My dad will be back tomorrow, and I really can't make you sleep and change in the same room.
76|Yeah, you're right.
76|By the way, what do you think the Hanekawas are going to do from now on?
76|We'll get a fire insurance payment,
76|so I guess we'll rent a place while they use that money to build a new house.
76|So you'll have a roof over your head if they hurry up and rent a place.
76|Yep.
76|I see.
76|Then...

76|Hanekawa, I've got a good idea. Want to know what it is?
76|A good idea?
76|It'll take a week at most for your parents to find a place, right?
76|I think this idea will see you through that week.
76|Okay. Let's hear it.
76|Please tell me what it is.
76|What should I do?
76|Should I tell her?
76|Or should I keep it a secret?
76|Say hello to the new, improved, and somewhat annoying Senjougahara.
76|Scene no. 269
76|Meow.
76|I'm sure you've already figured it out without an expurrnation,
76|but the reason we were skipping chapters when my meowster, Hanekawa Tsubasa, went to sleep
76|was because I've been making appurrances during those times.
76|Scene no. 291
76|The fact that the house she lived in for fifteen years burned to the ground
76|dealt a severe blow to my meowster's spirit. A blow to her mind, so to speak.

76|Who are you?
76|What are you?
76|The Curse Cat, more or less.
76|Well, the purrticulars are a bit different, and so is the basic concept,
76|but you could say it's not all that fur off the mark.
76|Really?
76|You seem completely different to me.
76|The Curse Cat I know is a weak oddity with a complete lack of presence,
76|so much so that you can't even tell if it's there.
76|You, on the other hand...
76|I don't have a comeback to that, unfurtunately.
76|Scene no. 332

76|Oh.
76|Anyway, I don't care about you.
76|But I suppose I should ask what you want from me.
76|You're blocking my path.
76|Since you and I are the same type of oddity, I'm sure you know what that means.

76|Then why are you standing there?
76|Oh, I just came here to warn you.
76|I couldn't care less about why you came to this town.
76|Your purrpose here doesn't matter to me either.
76|That's just how oddities like us are.
76|However,
76|if you hurt my meowster any more than you have already,
76|I'll kill you.
76|Oh, I see.
76|I thought you looked familiar.
76|You're that girl, aren't you?
76|Under construction
76|Sorry for the inconvenience
76|You've possessed her, haven't you?
76|Nah, I haven't possessed her, purr se.
76|I guess that'd be the case if I was a propurr Curse Cat,
76|but I'm pretty much the girl herself.
76|Who cares?
76|An oddity that's taken a liking to a human isn't all that rare.
76|But I'm sure oddities like you are more aware of this than anyone else.

76|Shaking paws is out of the question.
76|Emeowrgy Drain?
76|I have indeed heard of that,
76|but it's not like you'll suck everything out in an instant, right?
76|Surely you can shake hands.
76|Nice to meet you.
76|Take care of Hanekawa.
76|Scene no. 407
76|Why?
76|We skipped three whole chapters this time.
76|What happened while I was asleep?
76|Unnumbered Scene
76|Purple
76|Good morning, Hanekawa.
76|You wake up early, I see.
76|It's still only 6 AM.
76|But you're up too.
76|Oh, I go jogging in the morning.
76|I'm going through great pains to maintain this figure, you know.
76|Whatever I eat tends to end up as fat.
76|Scene no. 420
76|You seem tired
76|Will you jog with me?
76|Scene no. 421
76|I like to run when I'm tired
76|Nah.
76|I'll make breakfast while you're out jogging.
76|Let's eat when you get back.
76|Scene no. 423
76|Wow, this looks good.
76|Hanekawa, if I may...
76|What is it?
76|Ah, hold on a second.
76|Let me first wrap my head around this unbelievable state of affairs.
76|Huh?
76|Did I screw something up?
76|Good.
76|Uh... Senjougahara?
76|Do you know what dressing is, Hanekawa?
76|Huh?
76|Chinese dressing
76|Tare sauce
76|Well, of course I do.
76|That thing salads come with sometimes, right?
76|I get it.
76|There are people who put chuno sauce on fried eggs, some who use soy sauce, and some who use pepper instead.
76|What do you think of this conflict?
76|Chuno sauce
76|Oh, I've heard rumors about people who actually put something on their eggs.
76|Did you notice that there was butter and jam in the fridge?
76|I did, but we had that yesterday.
76|Sorry, did you use any?
76|I have a few more questions.
76|Go ahead.
76|I'd like to know about your diet.
76|My diet?
76|I think I have a very normal diet.
76|Scene no. 458
76|The
76|questioning
76|begins
76|Soy sauce with sushi?
76|No thanks!
76|Dips for tempura?
76|No thanks.
76|Granulated sugar on yogurt?
76|Don't need any.
76|Writing on Salisbury steak or omelets with ketchup?
76|Wouldn't happen.
76|Syrup on pancake?
76|Not a chance.
76|Salt in rice balls?
76|Not interested.
76|How much sugar for a coffee after dinner?
76|I'll take it black, please.
76|Scene no. 472
76|The
76|questioning
76|ends
76|Okay.
76|Oh, I get it now.
76|Sorry, I didn't know you preferred salad with dressing.
76|So that's why you had such a weird look on your face.
76|No, I was unaware that someone who didn't like salad dressing existed.
76|This is the first time I've seen someone serve plain fried eggs,
76|or bread with nothing else on the table.
76|Are you not too fond of adding flavor to your food?
76|Do you like the natural taste of the ingredients?
76|Not really.
76|But food's tasty even without any flavoring, isn't it?
76|So it's settled then.
76|Huh? I'm just saying it doesn't really make a difference if there's any flavoring or not.
76|I suppose this is what they call "letting the cat out of the bag."
76|Scene no. 486
76|The cat's been out of the bag for quite a while now.
76|Thanks for the food.
76|I fully take back what I said about the two of us having similar tastes.
76|You're like the exact opposite of someone with an unbalanced diet.
76|That isn't to say that you're not picky, either.
76|I'm sorry, Senjougahara.
76|I still don't really get what you're trying to tell me.
76|A household taste, huh?
76|But I guess that's off too.
76|You just accept all kinds of flavors, I guess?
76|You're fine with anything as long as it's edible and nutritious.
76|Or does nutrition not matter as long as it accumulates in your stomach?
76|Stop making it sound like I'm a soldier or something.
76|But you do have a sense of taste.
76|If you're not doing this because you like how the ingredients taste,
76|then maybe it just shows how tolerant you are.
76|But, y'know, Hanekawa,
76|I think there's something wrong with that lifestyle.
76|And I'm not just talking about your diet, either.
76|You just...
76|accept anything and everything.
76|Don't you think having things you hate is just as important as having things you like?
76|And yet you accept anything and everything.
76|That might be why you accept me,
76|and also why you accept Araragi.
76|That's how it makes me feel.
76|Scene no. 509
76|Did we change the subject?
76|Scene no. 509
76|Did we stray from the subject?
76|Scene no. 509
76|Did the subject get much wider?
76|Scene no. 509
76|No, that's not it.
76|Our tastes aren't similar, are they?
76|It's just that you like everything, including the stuff I like.
76|Well, maybe it's not correct to say that you have "tastes."
76|Scene no. 511
76|Some things are better left unsaid.
76|I mean, if you like anything and everything,
76|that means they're all the same to you.
76|Scene no. 514
76|Hey, Hanekawa.
76|Unnumbered Scene
76|Purple
76|Senjougahara looked straight into my eyes as she said this:
76|Do you really like Araragi?
76|That flat tone reminded me of what she used to sound like.
76|Can you tell me one more time that you still love Araragi?
76|Let's feel each other's heartbeat
76|and tell each other of our feelings without lies
76|A normal Friday
76|is part of a series of days full of doubts and regrets
76|I try to think of a plan
76|to tell you of my love, but suddenly the day is over
76|I get so insecure when your eyes drift away
76|I don't want to wind up being super jealous
76|You know, I wish it was just us two
76|Don't laugh at my innocent words of love
76|Like I'd ever give up on you again
76|I desperately look for an answer
76|It's so ridiculous
76|Let's look into each other's eyes
76|discard our fear
76|and try explaining our feelings
76|Let's take a deep breath and try again

76|There isn't a third, though.
76|Here's the long-awaited Preview Quiz!
76|I'll pretend to sleep outdoors and scare everyone!
76|Is it really all that long-awaited?
76|We Fire Sisters make one plus one equal five, and sometimes even ten, but...
76|But?

76|Ah! Found the cat!
76|In this world, it often turns out that one plus one equals zero.
76|You put two wonderful things together, but they end up negating each other's good points.

77|This is as good a time as any, so I'll talk about Araragi-kun now.
77|Talk about Araragi Koyomi
77|Animation Number 3
77|Araragi Koyomi, who is Senjougahara's boyfriend and my friend.
77|Animation Number 4
77|Actually, I knew about Araragi-kun even before spring break.
77|Not everything, but I did know about him.
77|Araragi Koyomi
77|Animation Number 7
77|He was pretty famous among the students of Naoetsu High School.
77|Araragi Koyomi
77|Animation Number 9
77|Or to be blunt, he was very noticeable in a bad way.
77|May
77|Sat Fri Thu Wed Tue Mon Sun
77|What was he doing, playing hooky from school and being perfunctory for class and exams?
77|It seems he was doing something like what he had done during spring break and Golden Week.
77|The activities of the Fire Sisters, Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan, pale in comparison.
77|That is a mere rehashing of Araragi-kun's junior-high days.
77|Of course, what he did in junior high and what he's doing in high school are basically the same.
77|Barely legal extracurricular activities
77|Animation Number 23
77|However, it seems there's a big difference in his motivations.
77|He fought the law
77|Animation Number 25
77|I'm pretty impressed he lived to become a high-schooler
77|Animation Number 25
77|He refuses to discuss what happened, even more than the events of spring break.
77|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

77|But it seems there was a mental turning point during his first year of high school.
77|A cause for his "delinquencies" as he would put it.
77|However, change or no change, Araragi-kun is Araragi-kun.
77|He was composed when I met him, and though he's completely different now, he's still him.
77|Naoetsu High School
77|And today, like any day, he's on the move for some reason.
77|Ever since who-knows-when, I've been in love with such a person.
77|Exactly when did it start?
77|My reminiscences
77|Animation Number 42
77|I'll talk about that a little bit later.

77|Animation Number 73
77|of this sleeping face
77|Animation Number 73
77|all to himself just yet.
77|Animation Number 73
77|Oh, good morning, Hanekawa-san.
77|Good morning, Senjougahara-san.
77|Though I think it's past the time to say that.
77|Right. It's not that time of day anymore.
77|What time is it?
77|Well, 1:30...
77|AM or PM?
77|PM of course.
77|Animation Number 80
77|After that
77|Animation Number 80
77|Senjougahara-san and I really took a shower together after that conversation.
77|Senjougahara-san is the type of person who creates strong walls in her heart.
77|There's no mistake her former self, nicknamed "well-to-do girl,"
77|would never have let me stay the night or taken a shower with me.
77|Even before that, she would never have run around the city all night looking for me.
77|Thinking of the sheer weight of everything she's overcome recently,
77|I feel miserable about myself, because in the end
77|I haven't overcome a thing despite having similar experiences.
77|That's right. I have not overcome one thing.
77|Despite the commotion during Golden Week and the day before the arts festival,
77|I have not matured. I have not changed.
77|That's why I envied Senjougahara-san so and loved her so.
77|I couldn't bring myself to hate her.
77|I honestly thought that.
77|After that
77|Animation Number 109
77|Senjougahara and I had half an hour of fun in the shower, then, feeling refreshed,
77|Animation Number 109
77|we went to the dressing room.
77|Animation Number 109
77|I'm sure you feel apprehensive about wearing my lingerie,
77|but at least borrow my pajamas.
77|Since you probably bought those sweats that are as gentle as a stupa at a discount store,
77|I'll go ahead and throw them out.
77|That outfit's no good?
77|Awful.
77|Ionized
77|Hanekawa-san, you've been growing your hair out since you cut it after the arts festival?
77|I guess. I haven't gone to a hair salon since then.
77|Will you grow it out again?
77|Not sure. I realized for the first time after cutting my hair
77|that long hair is surprisingly less of a hassle to maintain.
77|Ionized
77|Maybe that's not too far-fetched a thought.
77|I have another futon that my father uses, but I don't know,
77|I'm uneasy letting a high-school girl sleep in the futon a forty-something old man usually sleeps in.
77|Yes, there's no choice. Hanekawa-san, let's sleep together in my futon.
77|It's all right. Rest assured I won't do anything.
77|We're just sleeping in the same futon. I won't lay a finger on you.
77|I think I'm understanding why you're able to date Araragi-kun.
77|Animation Number 174
77|Hanekawa, I swear I won't use you as a body pillow!
77|All right, I get it. Say no more. That wasn't a concern.
77|Really? Thank you.
77|Then you can use my pillow. I'll use my father's.
77|What about the option of you sleeping in your father's futon?
77|If I were to sleep in his futon, I wouldn't be able to sleep with you.
77|I see.
77|Besides, I have an Electra complex, so I'd get too excited to sleep if I slept in his futon.
77|Senjougahara-san, you're being too frank.
77|Black Scene
77|Animation Number 'none'
77|Well then, let's go to sleep, Down-filled Futon...
77|No, Hanekawa-san.
77|Animation Number 192
77|Nobody would ever say "down-filled futon" when thinking about saying "Hanekawa."
77|Good night.
77|It'd been so long since I said good night that it felt like it was my first time.
77|When dealing with a Roomba, you might say good morning, but you'd never say good night.
77|Hoshinomiya
77|2-4-101
77|Let's climb the stairs quietly
77|1:30 PM, huh?
77|It feels like we really slept well. Did you wake up just now too?
77|Yeah, basically.
77|I never thought we'd wake up in the same futon.
77|Don't make it sound like pillow talk.
77|I'm high-strung, so I'm usually a light sleeper, but somehow I slept really deeply.
77|I wonder why? Maybe because I had a good pillow?
77|In any case, aren't you hungry?
77|I was thinking about making some breakfast... no, lunch.
77|Oh, sounds good. I'll definitely partake.
77|Do you have food you dislike?
77|No.
77|Okay. Lun-lun-lun...
77|By the way, the kanji for "mo" in "moyashi" is the same "mo" in "moe."
77|Animation Number 201
77|Moyashi
77|Ever since I learned that, they've been so good. So good.
77|Hopelessly good.
77|Well, knowing that didn't change its taste for me.
77|So what do you think? Maybe calling someone a "beansprout kid" is actually a compliment.
77|Animation Number 208
77|Do you cook at all?
77|Yep, I do. Everything I eat I cook for myself.
77|I see. I did that for a while too.
77|Thank you for this meal.
77|Oh, it's good.
77|Really? Araragi-kun wasn't thrilled with it, so I was honestly prepared for scathing criticism.
77|Scathing criticism? I think it's pretty good, but taste buds differ from person to person.
77|In other words, our tastes are pretty similar.
77|Our taste in food and in men.
77|Animation Number 235
77|Oh my, how bad-mannered of me
77|Senjougahara-san, you're really too frank about things like that.
77|Well, I thought it'd be better to discuss those things too so we could truly break the ice.
77|One wrong step and the gap between us might have grown.
77|Animation Number 238
77|She's such a challenger
77|Then why don't we go out on a limb and tell each other what parts of Araragi-kun we like?
77|No, we shouldn't, because on the odd chance this leaks out, he'll go on an ego trip.
77|Then what should we discuss?
77|Let's see... Why don't we talk about what parts of him we detest.
77|I'll take it.
77|I think it's time we talk about the future.
77|What do you mean?
77|I mean your future.
77|Let's say you stay here tonight. What about tomorrow?
77|Do you have any ideas?
77|Ideas?
77|None.
77|I see.
77|To be honest, I'd like you to stay over tomorrow and beyond as well...
77|But as you can tell, our home is cramped, so I can't possibly ask you,
77|to sleep, wake up, and change in the same room as my father, who's back tomorrow.
77|Yeah, that would actually be a bit much.
77|So what's your guess on the Hanekawa household's future?
77|They'll get money from fire insurance, and while they're rebuilding
77|I figure we'll be renting.
77|If your family hurries and finds a place to rent, at least that secures you a place to sleep, right?
77|Well, then,
77|Hanekawa-san, I have a good idea. Want to hear it?
77|A good idea?
77|It should take your parents a week at most to find a place to rent.
77|I think you could manage that with this idea.
77|I'd like to hear it. Please tell me.
77|Now what should I do? Should I tell you, or should I keep it to myself?
77|Senjougahara-san turned a new leaf, and her candid personality became slightly more annoying.
77|Nya!
77|There's no need to explain, as you've purrobably realized
77|the chapter numbers skip when my myaster, Hanekawa Tsubasa, is asleep because I've come out.
77|The fact that the house she lived in for 15 years burned to the ground
77|caused a catastrophic shock to my myaster's spirit, or what you'd call her heart.
77|That's why I'm out.
77|Black Hanekawa's third appearance, meow.
77|I'm the incarnation of my myaster's stress, a symbol of fatigue.
77|The mere fact that I'm cut off from my myaster like this gives her peace of mind.
77|Animation Number 295
77|At least for my myaster. I've never purr a second hated her.
77|Animation Number 295
77|Not purr a second.
77|Maybe this way?
77|No, purrobably this way.
77|There it is.
77|Meddlecat. No, not quite...
77|You're not a Meddlecat. Even though I say that, you cannot be anything else.
77|What are you? You are what?
77|Basically a Meddlecat.
77|To be purrecise, you got the details and fundamental concept wrong, but it's not too far off.
77|Really? It seems like I'm completely off.
77|The Meddlecat aberration I know is very weak, and you wouldn't know if it's there or not.
77|But you...
77|Putting it that way, I can't say much.
77|Stuff happens, even for things like me.
77|Animation Number 332
77|Can't argue with that
77|Animation Number 332
77|Meddlecats
77|Animation Number 332
77|that maybe we're rather just odd stories, not oddities.
77|I see. Well, I couldn't care less about you.
77|But I must ask what you want of me.
77|As the same type of aberration, you must know what it means to bar my path.
77|The same type?
77|I should be a completely different type of aberration from this guy.
77|Animation Number 340
77|A cat and a tiger—he must mean we're similar in that way
77|I really don't intend to get in your way, meow.
77|Then why do you stand there?
77|Well, just to warn you.
77|I couldn't care less what your businyess in this town is.
77|And I don't care what your duties are.
77|That's how aberrations are.
77|But if you happen to cause any more harm to my myaster,
77|I will kill you.
77|I see. I thought I recognized you from somewhere.
77|You're that girl. You've possessed that girl.
77|Under construction
77|Sorry for the inconvenience
77|That's inyaccurate. I haven't possessed her.
77|If I was a decent Meddlecat, that'd be the case. But I'm more like the girl herself.
77|I don't care either way.
77|An aberration that sides with humans. That's not all that uncommon.
77|However, aberrations like you know best.
77|You can't hold back the traits of aberrations. The problem lies in those that can see them.
77|The one you call your "master" saw me.
77|That's all that matters.
77|Black Scene
77|Animation Number 'none'
77|It's useless.
77|It's all useless.
77|The girl... That girl saw me.
77|That alone is essential. That alone is important.
77|I have already started acting.
77|Can you wipe your feet before coming in?
77|I'm a light sleeper since I'm high-strung. Didn't I tell you that?
77|It's not like you told me, meow.
77|But you're still Hanekawa-san, right?
77|Though this is the first time I'm meeting you. Is Black Hanekawa-san all right?
77|Well, something like that.
77|I see.
77|What are you trying to do, meow?
77|I thought we'd shake hands in salutation.
77|Haven't you heard a thing?
77|My special ability as a Meddlecat is purrpetual Energy Drain.
77|By merely touching someone, I drain their life force.
77|A handshake's out of the question.
77|Energy Drain. I've heard of that, but it's not like you'll drain it all in an instant, right?
77|I'm sure you can at least manage a handshake.
77|Nice to meet you.
77|Take good care of Hanekawa-san for me.
77|Why? We skipped three whole chapters now.
77|Something must have happened while I was asleep.
77|Good morning, Hanekawa-san.
77|You're an early riser. It's still 6 AM.
77|Yeah. But you're awake too, Senjougahara-san.
77|I go on a short jog in the mornings.
77|I go through a lot of hard work to keep this figure.
77|I'm the type that easily stores anything I eat as blubber.
77|Animation Number 420
77|You seem tired
77|Would you like to jog with me?
77|Animation Number 421
77|I like to run when I'm tired
77|No thanks. I'll just make some breakfast while you're out jogging, Senjougahara-san.
77|Let's eat together when you're back.
77|Oh, that looks good.
77|Do you have a moment, Hanekawa-san?
77|What is it?
77|No, hold on. First...
77|About this unbelievable situation...
77|I have to be sure.
77|Huh, did I screw up something?
77|Hmm...
77|Senjougahara-san...
77|Hanekawa-san, do you know about salad dressing?
77|Huh?
77|Chinese dressing
77|Tare sauce
77|Of course I know. You mean the stuff that's poured on salads occasionally?
77|I see. I see.
77|Of the three fried-egg factions,
77|what do you think of those who use pepper, chuno sauce, or soy sauce?
77|Chuno sauce
77|Oh, I heard rumors of people putting stuff on their fried eggs.
77|Yup, yup.
77|Did you realize we had butter and jam in the fridge?
77|I saw them.
77|You put them out for me yesterday. Oh, sorry. Did you want them?
77|A few more questions.
77|Go ahead.
77|About your eating habits.
77|My eating habits? I think my eating habits are very ordinary.
77|Animation Number 458
77|The
77|questioning
77|begins
77|Soy sauce for sushi?
77|I don't dip.
77|Tsuyu for tempura?
77|I don't dip.
77|Sugar in yogurt?
77|I don't put any.
77|Ketchup letters on hamburg steaks or omelets?
77|I don't write any.
77|Sauce on okonomiyaki?
77|I don't brush any.
77|Salt in onigiri?
77|Not mixed in.
77|How much sugar in your coffee after a meal?
77|Black please.
77|Okay.
77|Animation Number 472
77|The
77|questioning
77|ends
77|Oh, I get it now. I'm sorry. Senjougahara-san, you're the type that uses salad dressing.
77|That's why you were making that strange face.
77|No. I wasn't aware that people who didn't use dressing existed until now.
77|I've never seen anyone eat fried eggs plain and put out plain bread.
77|Are you one of those people vehemently opposed to seasoning?
77|The type that enjoys the ingredients' natural flavors?
77|It's not that.
77|But isn't food good even without flavor?
77|There's the comment that seals the deal.
77|I'm just saying it's the same whether it has flavor or not.
77|They say secrets don't come from questioning, but slips of the tongue.
77|Animation Number 486
77|The cat's been out of the bag for quite a while now.
77|Thank you for that meal.
77|I completely take back my assertion that our tastes in food are similar.
77|You're like the polar opposite of a picky eater. Not that you have no preferences either.
77|I'm sorry, Senjougahara-san. I still don't really understand what you're saying.
77|A taste of home, huh?
77|That's not it either. I guess it just means you accept any flavoring, Hanekawa-san.
77|In the extreme, I'd say you just need it to be edible and nutritious.
77|Or just filling if it's not nutritious?
77|Don't make me out to be some warrior!
77|That you can taste is a burden. If you're not enjoying each ingredient's flavor
77|I guess it ends up being that you have a big heart.
77|But I think something's wrong with living like that, Hanekawa-san.
77|It's not something limited to your eating habits. You always, you know,
77|accept anything and everything as it comes your way.
77|To have something you detest is about as important as having something you love.
77|Yet you accept everything that comes your way, right?
77|That may be the case with me, and that may also be the case with Araragi-kun.
77|At least that's what I think.
77|Animation Number 509
77|Did we change the subject?
77|Animation Number 509
77|Did we stray from the subject?
77|Animation Number 509
77|Did the subject get much wider?
77|Animation Number 509
77|No, that's not it.
77|It's not that we shared tastes in food.
77|It was merely that your tastes in food completely enveloped my tastes.
77|No, I don't think I can call your preferences "tastes."
77|Animation Number 511
77|Some things are better left unsaid.
77|Because if you like anything and everything, they all end up being the same thing in the end.
77|Hanekawa-san?
77|Senjougahara-san continued without looking away from my eyes.
77|Were you really in love with Araragi-kun?
77|She sounded a little like she once did, with a flat tone of voice.
77|Can you tell me once more that you're still in love with Araragi-kun?
77|shinzou ni awasete hontou no kimochi o
77|I will convey my feelings my own way

77|She's got a girl's body.
77|She got used to being touched.
77|That makes you minus 1.
78|Scene no. 1
78|I've been wondering about it for a while, you see.
78|Wondering how you and Araragi are different.
78|You both get all too eager to sacrifice yourselves in a bid to help someone,
78|but from where I sit, you're worlds apart.
78|It's almost like you're nothing alike.
78|Black
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|Simply put, Araragi seems fake, whereas you're more like the real deal.
78|I've been wondering why this is, since you both act in very similar ways.
78|But now that I've eaten your food, I get the feeling I understand.
78|Understand what?
78|Figuring out a person's nature via their cooking reminds me of a certain cooking manga.
78|Purple
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|Reminds me of Oishinbo.
78|Why come right out with it after trying to be subtle?
78|You two perceive danger very differently.
78|Let's say there's a cat lying dead on the street after being run over by a car.
78|Giving the cat a proper burial is surely the right thing to do.
78|I believe that's what you'd do,
78|and while Araragi might complain about it, he'd probably do the same.
78|I'm sure the difference is the complaining part.
78|The vast majority of people would ignore it and walk past, as though they didn't see anything.
78|And they'd do that because burying a cat could be dangerous.
78|In our society, letting others find out that you're a nice person is a very risky move.
78|It's highly likely that someone would take advantage of it.

78|Araragi probably understands that acting like the bad guy is the safe thing to do.

78|You, on the other hand, are not aware of that at all.
78|No, hold on.
78|You probably realize that there's risk involved too.
78|However, you think it's no big deal.
78|That's probably it.
78|You don't regret a thing.
78|You don't see a problem with ill will or malintent.

78|You shouldn't just accept everything.
78|You aren't wary of stupidity or weakness.
78|Despite knowing that you could be taken advantage of, you don't care and keep doing the right thing.
78|Despite knowing that you might stand out in a bad way,
78|you always try to be ethical.
78|In conclusion, I won't say you're a nice person, a saint, or a paragon of virtue.
78|You just don't realize how dangerous darkness is.
78|You'd be a failure in the wild.

78|Actually, I was on my way to see Senjougahara.
78|Is she in the classroom?
78|Uh...
78|Senjougahara took the day off.
78|She's suffering from the flu.
78|I became her accomplice in her lie.

78|Oh, I see.
78|She's not around, huh?
78|What now?
78|Did you need her for something?

78|I guess you'll do.
78|She's polite,
78|but inconsiderate
78|Scene no. 97
78|The thing is, I got a text from Araragi just now.
78|What do you think this means?
78|What it means?
78|It means Araragi has something to ask you,
78|so he wants you to see him alone in the second-floor classroom at 9 PM, doesn't it?
78|I knew it.
78|What do I even do with this guy?

78|But why didn't he just call me?
78|I tried calling him multiple times, but I couldn't get through.
78|Scene no. 110
78|So he's asking me out on a date, I take it?
78|I'm sure he's not taking my calls because he's got a surprise in store for me.
78|Uh, don't you think the wording was a bit more serious?
78|Ah, I see.
78|Now I get it.
78|I wanted to read a book tonight,
78|but I can't ignore an invitation from Araragi.
78|I'd overcome any hurdle to heed his call.
78|Overcome any hurdle, huh?
78|Thank you for your help, Hanekawa.
78|Oh, you're welcome.
78|I heard your house had burned down, so I thought you'd be depressed.
78|But I'm relieved to see that you're doing well.
78|I can't believe she acts like this even though she knows.
78|Scene no. 121
78|Way to go, Hanekawa!
78|No.

78|I stopped by at the supermarket to replace the ingredients I used this morning.
78|Wait.
78|Pleased to meet you.
78|I'm Hitagi's father.
78|U-Um... I'm Hanekawa Tsubasa.
78|I'm very grateful I had the chance to stay here last night.
78|He sent a text to Kanbaru?
78|How annoying.
78|Araragi asked her for help and not me?
78|How should I pay her back for this?
78|I'll start with her organs—
78|Senjougahara, you're regressing!
78|Oops.
78|I'm sure he has his reasons.
78|The same goes for having to ask her about something.
78|I mean, unlike you and me,
78|Kanbaru still has an oddity residing in her left arm.
78|She does indeed.
78|Basically, it's more like he needs her left arm?
78|I'm just guessing, but yeah.
78|So, what are you going to do?
78|Black
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|What do you mean?
78|Are you going to that meet-up place or not?
78|Regardless of what his circumstances are, you'll be able to meet Araragi if you go there.
78|I considered it, but I don't plan to.
78|It feels like I'd be in the way if I did.
78|That so? Then I won't go either.
78|That so?
78|I'll just consider no news to be good news.
78|Unlike that one time with Kanbaru's monkey, it doesn't seem like he's trying to keep something from me either.
78|You won't go?
78|Black

78|I won't go.
78|Black

78|Like you,
78|I feel like I'd only be in the way if I went.
78|Also, I get the feeling there are other things I could be doing.
78|However, it looks like Araragi and Kanbaru weren't the only ones who still had an oddity residing in their bodies.
78|There's someone else?
78|Aren't Araragi's Vamp and Suruga's Monkey the only oddities around us now?
78|Purrcisely.
78|Oh, looks like they're here.
78|I put my guard up somewhat, wondering who it could be,
78|but when Senjougahara opened the door and I saw the girls standing on the other side,
78|I understood everything.

78|Oh, my. Well, well,
78|if it isn't Karen.
78|Never thought I'd run into you out here. What a coincidence.
78|Oh, if it isn't Senjougahara!
78|Seriously, what a coincidence.
78|Never thought I'd see you right in front of my house.
78|Huh? Hang on. What about school, Senjougahara?
78|School?
78|What's that?
78|Uh, I guess it's okay if you don't know what it is.
78|I was kidding. I know what it is.
78|That was just a Gahara joke.
78|Oh, and by the way,
78|this just suddenly, and by that I mean "just happened to," came to mind.
78|Did you know?
78|There was a fire at Hanekawa's place.
78|Huh?
78|Bolt from the blue
78|Scene no. 195
78|Oh, I'm sorry.
78|That was a stupid question.
78|Of the two Fire Sisters, heroes of justice, you're the one in charge of combat.
78|The peace of this town rests on your shoulders, Araragi Karen,
78|and there's no way you wouldn't have known about such a major incident, right?
78|Huh?
78|Y-Yeah, you're right! Of course I knew.
78|Must've been hard.
78|I was actually thinking of giving Tsubasa a visit to see how she was doing.
78|Hanekawa wasn't hurt.
78|But since the house burned down, she has nowhere to sleep tonight.
78|What? Really?
78|You didn't know?
78|Nah, I totally knew!
78|I was actually going to bring that up, y'know.
78|Why'd you have to go and say it first?
78|I apologize.
78|But it's quite unbelievable
78|that this world doesn't have a bed for a girl as nice as Hanekawa to sleep on.
78|How much more unfair could you get?
78|Actually, if there truly is such a thing as justice in this world,
78|this makes me wonder where it's spinning its wheels.
78|Scene no. 203
78|Since that hollow concept doesn't seem to be doing anything,
78|I'm taking the day off school to look for a place where Hanekawa could stay the night.
78|Araragi
78|Oh, I'm so sorry.
78|There's no point in complaining to you about this.
78|I mean, you're just Araragi's little sister.
78|At the end of the day, you're just a middle schooler.
78|I can't treat you like I'd treat him.
78|That would be expecting too much.
78|You can't do anything if brother dearest isn't around, so I'm just getting on your nerves, aren't I?
78|I am truly sorry.
78|Well then, I should be on my way.

78|Nah, I don't think you need to.
78|They're our parents, and Bro's, too.
78|They're a lot like us.
78|Huh?
78|But...
78|They both have a hot-blooded sense of justice,
78|so they'd never tell someone in need of help to leave.
78|Black
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|Say, Karen, Tsukihi.
78|Just so I know, I'd like to ask you something.
78|You said both your parents worked, right?
78|Yeah!
78|I think they'll be back by around six today.
78|Scene no. 248
78|What do they do?
78|Together they said...
78|Scene no. 249
78|They're police officers!
78|Scene no. 250
78|Of course, there were some bumps on the road.
78|But still, it unexpectedly didn't take much for Mr. and Mrs. Araragi to say,
78|"If that's what's going on, then we can't say no."
78|They were by no means gung-ho about it,
78|but in the end they let me stay with them.
78|That side of them certainly fit the label "Araragi's parents" to a T.
78|Either way,
78|was this the good idea Senjougahara was talking about?
78|Senjougahara planted this idea in Karen's head.
78|Scene no. 258
78|That was her "trump card."
78|Stop it!
78|It's gonna get into my eyes!
78|How should I put this?
78|It was like I was taking advantage of the Fire Sisters' sense of justice,
78|so it made me feel even more guilty than usual,
78|Lilac
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|but Senjougahara had taken it upon herself to play the villain.
78|Also...
78|I was just waiting for you to bring it up, you see.
78|It was the same
78|Scene no. 273
78|This all happened without me once asking for help.
78|when Senjougahara let me
78|Scene no. 273
78|stay at her place.
78|Scene no. 273
78|I'm sure it's completely different from Oshino's "people have to save themselves" line of thinking.
78|Yeah...
78|I've probably abandoned myself.
78|I remember the words Senjougahara said to me this morning.
78|Scene no. 278
78|I don't look to save myself.
78|I accept the lack of flavor,
78|I'm don't realize how dangerous darkness is,
78|and I'm a failure in the wild.
78|You're not very snobby, are you, Tsubasa?
78|I mean, when I'm talking to the so-called brainiacs at school,
78|it makes me wonder if they really are all that smart sometimes.
78|They use all these big words, or make references nobody cares about.
78|But you're different.
78|You're smart,
78|Yellow
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|but you stand on equal grounds when you talk to people like me.
78|That really makes a person happy, y'know.
78|Blue
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|Yeah.
78|But apparently that's how things work, Karen.
78|White
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|The really smart people—
78|more like, you find out that all the "talented" folk, be it at sports or whatever,
78|tend to be surprisingly normal when you talk to them.
78|They don't tend to put on airs at all.
78|I wonder if they don't feel the need to embellish who they are because they're the real thing, so to speak.

78|Good night, Hanekawa.
78|See you tomorrow.
78|That said,
78|Black
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|considering I was wearing Araragi's pajamas,
78|lying on his bed,
78|and resting my head on his pillow,
78|I found it hard to sleep,
78|and only dozed off past midnight,

78|Scene no. 315
78|Now, then.
78|What on meowrth should I do about this?
78|I've been making frequent appurrances,
78|which means my meowster's under some kinda stress yet again.
78|I thought the fire at her place was to blame,
78|but it really doesn't seem like that's all there was to it.
78|Lilac
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|But only making appurrances when she's asleep?
78|What a flexible ailment.
78|Lilac
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|The purrevious two times,
78|those guys had to go through so much trouble just to supurress me.
78|They even had to get that pintsize vampire to help them out and all.
78|Who are you calling a pintsize vampire?
78|Yellow
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|Meow?
78|Long time no see, Cat.
78|I haven't a clue what you're doing in my master's quarters,
78|but I suppose it'd be rather boorish to ask an oddity why it showed up.
78|I'm not like that fellow with the Hawaiian shirt.
78|Huh? What's going on?
78|Weren't you supposed to be impurrisoned in that human's shadow?

78|24
78|35
78|'Tis true.
78|These are rather irregular circumstances, you see.
78|Currently, my master and me—
78|Oshino Shinobu and Araragi Koyomi have had our link severed.
78|Huh? You're not?
78|I thought that perhaps my master could've returned to his abode,
78|but I see it was but a fleeting hope.
78|Forget that. I ended up finding you here.
78|I suppose this is how Little Red Riding Hood must've felt when she found the big bad wolf.
78|If it's your meowster you want,
78|I think he was at that abandoned cram school at around 9 PM.
78|He was meeting that meownkey woman.
78|What?
78|Meeting the monkey this late in the game—
78|Oh, I see now!
78|Coming from my master, that is a rather good idea.
78|The oddity isn't important.
78|It's the "lineage" that the lady possesses.
78|Lineage?
78|You've provided me some valuable information.
78|Now I can say this wasn't a wild goose chase.
78|You have my praise.
78|I was planning on sucking your blood for fun,
78|but I'll give up on that as my token of gratitude.
78|Purretty close call.
78|Scene no. 344
78|What a terrifying plan!
78|Or would you rather I sucked your blood as my token of gratitude instead?
78|I'll pass.
78|Things are different this time.
78|This time, I'm purretty sure I have a fully respectable mission.
78|I'm not furry sure what it's supposed to be, though.
78|Understood
78|Scene no. 347
78|I see.
78|You're pretty much a new type of oddity,
78|so that's not a decision that should be made lightly.
78|To put it simply, you and your former self
78|are like Terminator and Terminator 2.
78|That is a simple analogy,
78|but should you, as a vampire, really be using that?
78|Either way, me sucking your blood is but a makeshift measure
78|that does nothing but fix things temporarily.
78|It is not a technique that ought to be used multiple times.
78|Purrcisely.
78|I might be out here like it's nothing,
78|but at the end of the day, I'm only my meowster's dark side.
78|I can't be taking center stage.
78|What does it matter?
78|You're like two sides of the same coin.
78|I can't say my master's much better,
78|but you seem to be indulging in the futile—
78|or well, running around in circles.
78|I've lived for five hundred years, and this is a deeply significant flashback of mine.
78|Shut up and listen.
78|'Tis an anecdote about Emperor Napoleon.
78|Apparently, that fellow slept for naught but three hours each day.
78|What about it?
78|Let me finish.
78|On the other hand, he was well-known for his love of baths.
78|I hear he spent more than six hours each day taking them.
78|Yellow
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|Speaking in modern day terms, he was like Shizuka.
78|Her knowledge is furcused on the wrong things.
78|Scene no. 358
78|When I heard these two anecdotes, I couldn't help but wonder.
78|"I know!"
78|"He's gotta be sleeping in the bath!"
78|Oh! That makes purrfect sense!
78|Black
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|Basically,
78|things that seem completely different at first glance might be unexpectedly related.
78|That's what I'm trying to say here.
78|There is no point to splitting things up as "heads" or "tails."
78|Sure, you as Black Hanekawa may have a different personality from Hanekawa Tsubasa.
78|That said, there isn't much of a difference between the two,
78|in my opinion.
78|In my eyes, oddities and humans aren't all that different.
78|Oh.
78|Meow that you mention it...
78|Scene no. 370
78|Me and my meowster are the same, huh?
78|Sometimes I feel light as a feather,
78|and sometimes things weigh me down.
78|Scene no. 370
78|In that case, though, I really must avoid letting you suck my blood.
78|I suppose.
78|Having you disappear naturally would be for the best.
78|And I'm speaking in both specialist and oddity terms here.
78|So Vampurr,
78|if you wish to thank me, could you answer a question fur me?
78|Hmm?
78|I don't mind.
78|Keep it short,
78|for I must head to where my master is at once.
78|If I don't hurry, that good-for-nothing fellow could get killed for real this time.
78|Do you know of a tiger oddity?
78|Tiger?
78|Yeah, a tiger.
78|He's purrently loitering in this town.
78|There are plenty of tiger oddities.
78|Just the ones I know add up to a pretty big number.
78|And if I include the knowledge I gained from that kid with the Hawaiian shirt,
78|that number easily goes past fifty.
78|It's a purretty huge tiger.
78|Most tigers are.
78|A smaller one would weed out more options.
78|He's really fast!
78|He got around in furont of me in an instant!
78|Most tigers are.
78|An immobile one would weed out more options.
78|Also, he can talk.
78|He can talk?
78|An oddity that takes on a beastly form and can talk, huh?
78|That is quite unusual,
78|but hearing that has made me even more unsure of what it is.
78|To begin with, there's no way I wouldn't have noticed a strange oddity loitering in this town.
78|Are you saying you saw that tiger?
78|Yeah.
78|Actually, hang on.
78|I did see him, but my meowster saw him first.
78|That's why I saw him too.
78|That might be the focal point here.
78|Basically, it's an oddity that only the two of you can see.
78|Oddity
78|Scene no. 386
78|A tiger that only you two can see.
78|Tiger
78|Scene no. 386
78|It's just a possibility, though.
78|My apologies for not being of much help.
78|I'd like some time to think of ways to thank you.
78|Hey, Vampurr.
78|What is it, Cat?
78|I'll give you a ride.
78|I can reach that building in one fell swoop.
78|Scene no. 393
78|Don't be so cautious.
78|You can't fly now, right?
78|It's not much trouble for me,
78|and you can save thirty minutes.
78|Yellow
78|Unnumbered Scene
78|Could I ask that of you?
78|Swift decision
78|Scene no. 395
78|Sure thing. Go right ahead.

78|Off Limits
78|Oshino Meme's home for several months,
78|a very memorable place for my meowster, Senjougahara Hitagi,
78|Kanbaru Suruga, and Sengoku Nadeko, and an abandoned cram school,

78|the abandoned ruin of that school, was not there.

78|Let's feel each other's heartbeat
78|and tell each other of our feelings without lies
78|A normal Friday
78|is part of a series of days full of doubts and regrets
78|I try to think of a plan
78|to tell you of my love, but suddenly the day is over
78|I get so insecure when your eyes drift away
78|I don't want to wind up being super jealous
78|You know, I wish it was just us two
78|Don't laugh at my innocent words of love
78|Like I'd ever give up on you again
78|I desperately look for an answer
78|It's so ridiculous
78|Let's look into each other's eyes
78|discard our fear
78|and try explaining our feelings
78|Let's take a deep breath and try again

78|You're counting them as beasts?
78|Preview Quick!
78|Quick?!
78|Keep things moving at a brisk pace, I mean.
78|I realized this while playing with Bro the other day.
78|Aren't nail clippers amazing?
78|Suck
78|What the heck? Who the hell invented this thing?
78|A sharp tool that exists solely to clip nails, and one that is easy enough for every kid to use!
78|Don't you feel life would be really inconvenient if it didn't exist?
78|You may very well be right.
78|We might not be able to take care of our nails!
78|Suck
78|The sharp part is amazing in and of itself, but the lever and the file being merged is amazing too.
78|Not to mention, you can attach a case so your nails don't go flying around.
78|This tool's innovation knows no bounds!
78|Long live nail clippers!
78|Long live nail clippers?!
78|The Fire Meowster's power is exploding!
78|Ah!
78|Boom!
78|I want to shower it with praise using a flame torch made of nails!
78|And that's the end of the explanation of the amazing nail clippers,
78|which I totally nailed!
78|Why'd you have to go and do that after you wrapped it up so nicely?

79|No, I've been thinking for a while now
79|about how you and Araragi-kun differ, Hanekawa-san.
79|Both of you sacrifice yourselves to help others with such zeal.
79|But in my eyes, you have almost nothing in common.
79|You seem like totally different beings.
79|In simpler terms, it feels like Araragi-kun is a fake, and you're the real thing, Hanekawa-san.
79|You're doing the same thing, but why do I feel this way?
79|I think I understand from this meal you made.
79|You understand now?
79|It feels like a cooking manga where I can figure out people's qualities by eating their cooking.
79|Like Oishinbo.
79|Why'd you mention the title anyway?
79|There's a difference in awareness of danger between you and Araragi-kun.
79|For instance, if a cat were killed on the street by a car
79|giving it a proper burial is probably the correct course of action.
79|I'm sure that's what you would do.
79|Araragi-kun probably would as well, though he'd be grumbling the whole time.
79|I'm sure the difference is the "grumbling the whole time" part.
79|Why do so many people ignore that cat and pass by as if nothing had happened?
79|Because it's "dangerous" to give it a burial.
79|Because there's a very high risk when society knows
79|that you're a "good, virtuous person."
79|There's a very high chance someone will exploit you.
79|Open
79|Ignite
79|Araragi-kun probably knows pretending to be a bad person is safer.
79|You, on the other hand, don't understand that at all.
79|No, that's not it. I'm sure you also realize such a risk exists,
79|but you don't think it's that big a deal.
79|That's probably it. You don't regret anything.
79|You don't feel anything about the ill will people have.
79|Or rather...
79|You accept them all as they are. You're probably just too white.
79|You're too pure a white.
79|You're not supposed to accept everything.
79|You have no sense of alarm against stupid or bad things.
79|Even though you know you'll be exploited, you do good deeds anyway.
79|Even though you know you'll distance yourself from others, you try to stay logical.
79|To conclude, you're not a good person nor a saint nor a madonna.
79|You're just thick-headed when it comes to shadows.
79|In that case...
79|You will be a failure in the wild.

79|I was just on my way to see Senjougahara-senpai.
79|Is she in the classroom?
79|Um...
79|Senjougahara-san is absent from school today. She caught influenza.
79|I became her accomplice in her lie.
79|Animation Number 92
79|Hmm, I see. She isn't here? What should I do?
79|Did you have something for Senjougahara-san?
79|If you want to tell me, I can at least listen.
79|I guess you'll have to do!
79|She's polite,
79|but inconsiderate
79|Animation Number 97
79|Actually, I just got a text from Araragi-senpai.
79|What do you think this means?
79|There's no other meaning.
79|He has something to tell you,
79|so he wants you to go to the second-floor classroom at nine o'clock tonight, right?
79|So that is it. He's so troublesome sometimes.
79|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
79|This meeting place of a "second-floor classroom" is too vague.
79|How many buildings does he think Naoetsu High has?
79|No, not our school. I think he means the cram-school ruins.
79|Oh, really?
79|But he could've called me then.
79|Actually, I tried calling several times but couldn't get through.
79|So this means he's asking me out on a date?
79|He must not be answering because he's preparing some surprise.
79|Don't you think it's more serious based on his wording?
79|I see. I see. I'm convinced.
79|I wanted to read a book tonight, but I've got no choice if he's asking me out.
79|I'll oblige his request of my presence at any cost.
79|At any cost?
79|Well, Hanekawa-senpai, thanks for telling me all this.
79|Not at all. You're welcome.
79|I heard your house caught fire, so I thought you'd be down
79|but I'm relieved to see nothing of the sort.
79|I can't believe she acts like this even though she knows.
79|Animation Number 121
79|As expected of Hanekawa-senpai.
79|No.
79|Animation Number 123
79|Did she really know?
79|Why did she say I don't seem to be feeling down?
79|Animation Number 124
79|Then best of luck.
79|It's unreasonable.
79|Animation Number 133
79|There must be some need for Araragi-kun to specifically text Kanbaru-san.
79|So it's unreasonable for me to be mulling over him asking Kanbaru-san for help instead.
79|That's why I think I'm being unreasonable.
79|Animation Number 137
79|1 0 2
79|Oh, welcome back.
79|Senjougahara
79|Animation Number 143
79|Hanekawa-san, you're quite late.
79|Yeah. I stopped by the supermarket to restock the food I used for breakfast... Oh?
79|Nice to meet you. I'm Hitagi's father.
79|Um, I'm Hanekawa Tsubasa. Excuse me for having slept over last night.
79|He texted Kanbaru? How unpleasant.
79|To think Araragi-kun would seek that woman's help over mine.
79|What should I do? First, disembowel.
79|Your persona's turning back from its new leaf.
79|Whoops.
79|I'm sure there's a reason.
79|Concerning that, the fact he has something to ask must be part of it.
79|After all, unlike us, Kanbaru-san's aberration remains in her left arm, right?
79|It does.
79|In other words, he doesn't want Kanbaru per se, but rather just her left arm?
79|Well, it's just a guess.
79|So what will you do?
79|Black Scene
79|Animation Number 'none'
79|Do what?
79|Will you go? Or will you not?
79|No matter what condition he's in, you could see Araragi-kun if you go.
79|I thought about it, but I'm not planning to. I have a feeling I'd get in the way if I did.
79|I see. Then I won't go either.
79|Really?
79|I'll just go with "no news is good news."
79|Unlike the time with Kanbaru's monkey,
79|it doesn't seem like he's really trying to hide something.
79|You won't go?
79|I won't.
79|Like you, I feel I'd only get in the way.
79|Besides, I have a feeling there's something else that I can be doing.
79|But it seems Araragi-kun and Kanbaru aren't the only ones who still have aberrations in them.
79|Who else?
79|The only aberrations left around us are Araragi-kun's demon and Kanbaru-san's monkey, right?
79|That's right, meow.
79|Whoa. They're here.
79|I braced myself for a moment, wondering who it was.
79|But when Senjougahara-san opened the door and I saw those girls, I understood everything.
79|Trump card
79|Animation Number 185
79|It was Araragi-kun's younger sisters.
79|Araragi Karen-chan and Araragi Tsukihi-chan, The Fire Sisters.
79|After school - the Araragi residence
79|Animation Number 188
79|Apparently, they had a conversation like this.
79|Oh, what's this? If it isn't Karen-san. What a coincidence to see you here.
79|And if it isn't Senjougahara-san!
79|This really is a coincidence, running into you in front of my house.
79|But Senjougahara-san, what about school?
79|School? What's that?
79|If you don't know, that's fine...
79|I kid. I know. It's a Gahara-joke. That reminds me.
79|I just remembered this out of the blue.
79|Did you know that Hanekawa-san's house burned down?
79|Bolt from the blue
79|Animation Number 195
79|Sorry, that was a silly question.
79|There's no way you, the mobile half of the heroes of justice, the Fire Sisters,
79|who upholds the peace of this town, wouldn't know of such a huge incident.
79|Oh, yeah, yeah, of course I knew.
79|That must have been rough. I was just thinking of paying Tsubasa-san a consolation visit.
79|Hanekawa-san wasn't injured. But without a home, she has no place to sleep tonight.
79|Really?
79|You didn't know?
79|No, I knew! I was just about to bring up that subject.
79|Why do you say everything before me?
79|I'm sorry.
79|But it really is strange that there's no bed in this world a good girl like her can get a good night's sleep on.
79|It feels like the epitome of absurdity.
79|It's like I'd want to ask what justice is doing right now if it existed in this world.
79|Well, justice is empty and ineffectual,
79|so I'm actually taking off from school today to find Hanekawa-san a roof to sleep under.
79|Araragi
79|Whoa, sorry. Even if I'm telling you this, it's not like you can help.
79|After all, though you're Araragi Koyomi's younger sister, you're merely a junior-high student.
79|The expectations would be too heavy if I treated you like Araragi-kun.
79|You can't do anything without your dear older brother, so I only troubled you by mentioning this.
79|I'm truly sorry. I guess I'll be on my way now.
79|Just like there's no place for Hanekawa-san to sleep, I know there's no justice in this world.
79|Hold on a second!
79|The fox
79|Animation Number 217
79|jumped in the well
79|Animation Number 217
79|on its own.
79|Animation Number 217
79|What? Is something wrong?
79|There is a place for Tsubasa-san to sleep! And there is justice!
79|Araragi residence Living room
79|/
79|Animation Number 220
79|And so I'm now at the Araragi residence.
79|Relax. Think of this as your own home, Tsubasa-san.
79|That's right! Think of this as your home! It's all yours, Hanekawa-san.
79|You're pretty risqué anyway, Tsubasa-san.
79|I think she meant reserved,
79|not risqué
79|Animation Number 228
79|If you didn't have a place to sleep, you could've come to me first and foremost.
79|I've been waiting for you to approach me about this.
79|But I thought it was hard for you to bring it up, so I offered.
79|Yeah.
79|You were the one who made the offer, Karen-chan.
79|In any case, if you don't have a place to stay, you can stay here as long as you want.
79|Fortunately for you, our brother isn't here right now. So you can use his room.
79|But you're right. I'll accept the favor and spend some time here.
79|I'll stay until Araragi-kun comes home, so
79|I'm in your care.
79|As are we.
79|Let's get along well.
79|That's right. Since I'll be a guest for many days, I need to say hello to your parents.
79|I think it'll be fine.
79|I mean, we're related by blood, so our personalities are similar.
79|But still...
79|They both have a passion for justice, so they'd never tell someone in need to get out.
79|Say, Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan,
79|I'd like to know for reference, but you said before that your parents both work, right?
79|I think they'll come home around six today.
79|What kind of work do they do?
79|Together they said...
79|Animation Number 249
79|They're police officers!
79|There was trouble of course.
79|But the Araragi pair simply said, "If that's the case, there's nothing we can do."
79|It wasn't with a very positive attitude, but in the end, they gave permission for me to stay over.
79|As expected, they gave the feeling that they were Araragi-kun's parents.
79|But still, was this the "good idea" Senjougahara-san mentioned?
79|Senjougahara planted this idea in Karen's head.
79|Animation Number 258
79|That was her "trump card."
79|I'm gonna get bubbles in my eyes!
79|I felt like I played upon the Fire Sisters' sense of justice
79|and couldn't help but feel a touch of guilt.
79|But Senjougahara-san had put the villain's role on her shoulders for me.
79|And...
79|I've been waiting for you to approach me about this.
79|I never seek out help for myself.
79|It was the same
79|Animation Number 273
79|when Senjougahara let me
79|Animation Number 273
79|stay at her place.
79|Animation Number 273
79|This is probably completely different reasoning from Oshino-san's "people just help themselves."
79|That's right, I'm probably in desperation time.
79|I remember the words Senjougahara said to me this morning.
79|Animation Number 278
79|I don't think I can survive by myself.
79|I've come to accept the bland. I'm dull against the shadows.
79|And in the wild, I'm a failure.
79|You don't put on airs.
79|Or more like when I'm talking to a smart guy at school, I often think, "Are you really smart?"
79|Like when they use hard words or reference stuff I don't want to know.
79|Still, you're smart, but you always talk to us at our level.
79|Stuff like that makes me happy!
79|You're right. But they say that's how things really are, Karen-chan.
79|People who are really smart, or rather, whether it be sports or whatever,
79|"first-class" people are surprisingly ordinary when you talk to them. They have no auras.
79|But maybe because they're real, they don't have to embellish themselves.
79|Araragi's room
79|Animation Number 301
79|Discomfort
79|Animation Number 302
79|Huh? Aren't these men's pajamas?
79|Oh, those are our brother's.
79|What's with this
79|Animation Number 305
79|"wow, I did it" feeling?
79|Animation Number 305
79|Well, good night, Tsubasa-san. Use anything you want in here.
79|Good night, Hanekawa-san. I'll see you tomorrow.
79|In any case...
79|The thought that I was then wearing Araragi-kun's pajamas,
79|crawling in his bed, and resting my head on his pillow
79|was keeping me from falling asleep. And I think I actually didn't fall asleep until around midnight.

79|But I can't blame Araragi-kun. I'm naughty for having thoughts like that.
79|Nyow then, what should I do about this?
79|Since I've come out like this again, it's obvious my myaster is carrying around some sort of stress.
79|I thought it was the house burning down, but since I'm here that's inyarguably not the case.
79|It's truly flexible for me that I can show up only when my myaster is asleep.
79|The previous two times, they had quite a bit of trouble suppurressing me.
79|Like when they borrowed the power of that short vampire.
79|Who's a short vampire?
79|Meow?
79|It's been a while, cat. Though I don't know why you're in my master's room.
79|I guess it's bad taste to ask why an aberration has appeared, I'm not that Hawaiian-shirt guy.
79|Wait, weren't you trapped inside that humyan boy's shadow?

79|Well, I was, but there were a few irregularities.
79|Right now, the pairing between me and my master, Oshino Shinobu and Araragi Koyomi, has been severed.
79|Severed?
79|I thought perhaps my master would be home, but I guess that was the slightest of hopes.
79|And I find you here instead. It feels like I avenged someone who died in Edo way over in Nagasaki.
79|Your myaster should've been at the cram-school ruins back around nine o'clock.
79|He was meeting that monkey girl.
79|Meeting her? But why the monkey now of all times?
79|Oh, I see. So that's it. I guess my master put some thought into it.
79|It was more the lineage's consciousness than the aberration.
79|Lineage's consciousness?
79|You gave me some good information.
79|It kept my trip from being meaningless. I give you praise.
79|I was thinking I'd relax a bit by sucking your blood, but as thanks, I'll refrain.
79|What an absurd thing to think!
79|Or would you rather me suck your blood in thanks?
79|I'll decline. The circumstances are slightly different nyow.
79|I feel there's a respectable mission waiting for me, meow.
79|Though I don't know what exactly in purrticular.
79|Understood
79|Animation Number 347
79|I see. Since you're like a new breed of aberration, I guess I shouldn't be too hasty in my decisions.
79|I guess the difference between you now and before
79|is like the difference between Terminator and Terminator 2.
79|That was easy to understand, but is that how a vampire should repurresent it?
79|In any case, my sucking your blood is a very makeshift therapy.
79|It's only a temporary fix.
79|It shouldn't be something we use repeatedly.
79|Right. And I'm out in the open nyow like it's the way it's meant to be,
79|but I'm only my myaster's hidden personality. I can't look dignified and stuff.
79|Open or hidden... it's merely two sides of the same coin.
79|My master's like this too, but you unnecessarily spin aimlessly at times.
79|I get the impression you're getting nowhere.
79|Stay quiet and listen to a memoir from someone who's lived 500 years.
79|This is a story about the emperor Napoleon. They say he only slept three hours each night.
79|Something wrong with that?
79|Just listen.
79|On the other hand, he was famous for loving baths.
79|They say he was in the bath more than six hours each day.
79|You could say a modern-day version would be Shizuka-chan.
79|Her knowledge is focused on the wrong things.
79|Animation Number 358
79|And after hearing both of these stories, I thought...
79|"No way! He had to have been sleeping in the bath!"
79|Oh, I see!
79|So I want to say even if two things seem different, they might be linked in the end.
79|There's no sense separating front from back when thinking.
79|You may be Black Hanekawa, a severed portion of Hanekawa Tsubasa's persona,
79|but I sense that there isn't a definitive difference between you two.
79|In my view, both aberrations and humans are rather similar.
79|I see.
79|My myaster and I are the same.
79|Now that you mention it...
79|Animation Number 370
79|Sometimes I feel light as a feather,
79|and sometimes things weigh me down.
79|Animation Number 370
79|But then that's all the more reason that I can't have you suck my blood.
79|It would be. Naturally disappearing would be best.
79|From a specialist and aberration's viewpoint.
79|So, vampire, if you want to thank me, can you answer one of my questions?
79|Well, I don't mind. But be quick about it. I must hurry over to where my master is.
79|If I don't hurry, that good-for-nothing will die for sure this time.
79|Do you know a tiger aberration?
79|Tiger?
79|Yeah, a tiger. It's been myeandering about the city lately.
79|There are many tiger aberrations. Quite a few that even I know of.
79|Combined with that Hawaiian-shirt guy's knowledge, it'd be at least fifty.
79|It's a myassive tiger.
79|Tigers usually are. Smaller would be better.
79|Um, it's unimaginyably quick. It beat me to the punch like nothing.
79|Tigers are usually agile. Motionless would be better.
79|Um, and it talks.
79|Talks? An aberration that takes animal form yet speaks...
79|That's, how do you say, rare.
79|But hearing that, I think I'm even more confused as to what it is.
79|Besides, if such an unknown aberration was walking around, there's no way I wouldn't notice.
79|Are you saying you saw it?
79|That's right, meow.
79|No, that's not it. I did, but my myaster saw it before me. That's why I saw it, too.
79|That means that might be your focal point. In other words, an aberration only you can see.
79|Aberration
79|Animation Number 386
79|A tiger that only you can see.
79|Tiger
79|Animation Number 386
79|It's a possibility. Sorry I couldn't help. I'll think about repaying you later.
79|Hey, vampire.
79|What is it, cat?
79|I'll give you a lift. It's one leap for me to get to those ruins.
79|Don't be so alarmed. You can't fly right nyow, can you?
79|It's not a purroblem for me. And you could save at least thirty minutes.
79|May I impose?
79|Swift decision

79|However, we could never arrive.

79|All that was there was ashes. The place Araragi Koyomi and Oshino Shinobu used as a hideout.
79|Off Limits
79|The place Oshino Meme lived for several months. The ruins of a cram school...
79|memorable to my myaster, Senjougahara Hitagi, Kanbaru Suruga, and Sengoku Nadeko.

79|the abandoned ruin of that school, was not there.

79|They exist only for the purpose of clipping nails, but they're so simple even children can use them!
79|Can you imagine how inconvenient a world without them would be?

79|And I'm not even finished. You can buy them real cheap in department stores,
79|you can carry them in a case so that your nails won't ever grow too long,

80|Got it!
80|I'm awake, don't worry.
80|I'll be right there.
80|Okay!
80|Araragi used to moan about being woken up by his sisters every morning,
80|but look at how sweetly they do it.
80|What's there to complain about?
80|Scene no. 48
80|What's wrong with him?
80|Scene no. 48
80|The way Araragi explains it,
80|Scene no. 48
80|one would be led to believe he's getting assaulted in his sleep with a crowbar.

80|Contact lenses in hand, I left Araragi's room.

80|Bye-bye.

80|Koyomi's mother
80|I don't know what your family circumstances are,
80|and I don't intend to ask any time soon.
80|But this situation with you living separated from your parents
80|and bidding us goodbye as you go off to school isn't one you should consider normal.
80|We can be your hosts,
80|but we can't become your family.
80|It doesn't matter how much Karen and Tsukihi look up to you as an older sister.
80|Oh, don't get me wrong.
80|I'm not saying you're not welcome here.
80|The two of them are happy to have you here,
80|and we'd like to treat one of Koyomi's friends as well as possible.
80|I hear it was thanks to you that he started to study properly.
80|Physics

80|Black
80|That's not true.
80|Sorry I made you worry.
80|But my family circumstances aren't as complicated as you think.
80|There's just a little discord right now.
80|That's all.
80|You know, parents not getting along with their kids
80|is almost like abuse in its own right.
80|A family isn't a must-have by any means,
80|but if you do have one, it should make you happy.
80|At least, that's what I believe as a mother.
80|As a mother?
80|People are free to run away if something bad happens to them,
80|but averting your eyes from reality doesn't count as running away.
80|Scene no. 79
80|Words of a mother
80|An outsider can't interfere as long as you're fine with your current situation.
80|How about saying goodbye to that, first?
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|Black
80|"Averting your eyes from reality doesn't count as running away," huh?
80|How profound.
80|Scene no. 91
80|I came face-to-face
80|Scene no. 91
80|with a scene that made me want to avert my eyes.
80|Uh...
80|Scene no. 92
80|A nasty-looking golden eye captures me.
80|Scene no. 100
80|We made eye contact.
80|Oh, it's you.
80|Er, what was it again?
80|Oh yeah, you're that girl I nearly killed once.
80|Lilac
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|That was hilarious!
80|Hello.
80|Long time no see, Mr. Episode.
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|Black
80|I heard you'd gone back home immediately after that,
80|so Mr. Episode, what brings you here again?
80|Hilarious.
80|Don't go calling me Mr. Episode.
80|The "Mister" makes me sound so old.
80|You don't need to speak so politely to me.
80|Huh?
80|Sure, you may be a half, but you're still a vampire.
80|Aren't you supposed to have a long life span?
80|Just having a long life span doesn't make me a senior citizen.
80|That's just hilarious!
80|This is supposed to be a secret, but I'll tell you since I'm finding this funny.
80|You're actually way older than I am.
80|As of today, I'm only six years old.
80|Six?!
80|Scene no. 115
80|I couldn't help but act obviously surprised.
80|Don't judge humans by their appearances, basically.
80|Though I'm not a human!
80|Well? Can I get an answer to my question? What brings you here to this town?
80|Quite fixated on that, aren't we?
80|I'd like to give you an answer since I owe you one,
80|Scene no. 120
80|Looks like trying to kill me
80|Scene no. 120
80|is something he at least considers a debt.
80|but to tell you the truth, I still don't know why I'm here.
80|I was summoned out of the blue, and I only just got off the night bus.
80|Night bus?
80|Scene no. 121
80|Are you a tourist?
80|He's surprisingly normal.
80|What do you mean by "summoned"?
80|That's nothing unusual for me.
80|I'm pretty much a freelance vampire hunter.
80|Unlike Dramaturgie or Guillotine Cutter,
80|I don't care who I work for as long as I get paid.
80|I'm just a selfish mercenary.
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|Black
80|You take up jobs without asking your clients what they want?
80|Well, I got paid in advance this time.
80|That, and I was in a situation where I couldn't refuse.
80|Either way, I don't really care what they want.
80|Then would you also consider exterminating a tiger?
80|Exterminating a tiger?
80|Er, not really.
80|I'm a hunter that specializes in vampires.
80|Tigers are a bit, uh...
80|Anyway, you...
80|Hanekawa Tsubasa, was it?
80|Compared to when I saw you last, you've become totally ordinary.
80|I mean, I almost didn't recognize you earlier, and I have a vampire's eyesight.
80|I guess I could call it the weirdness?
80|Whatever it was that I sensed in you earlier has vanished completely.
80|Well, it feels more like it was cut off...
80|leaving no traces behind.
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|Black
80|Scene no. 150
80|I get what he's trying to say.
80|Scene no. 150
80|But hold it right there.
80|Scene no. 150
80|This train of thought—
80|Scene no. 150
80|won't lead to anything good.
80|Oh, it was her!
80|She was the one who summoned me here without stating her business.
80|I hear she went to the same college as Oshino Meme, the guy with the Hawaiian shirt.
80|And I know him, so I had to heed her call.
80|Scene no. 160
80|Hey there, Sode.
80|I came to pick you up since you just wouldn't show up where I asked you to.
80|And here you are, busy picking up a girl. Sorry if I disturbed you or something.
80|Hmm?
80|Is that young lady over there Hanekawa Tsubasa?
80|Y-Yes, I am.
80|Well, well, what a coincidence.
80|I'm glad I went out of my way for once and ran into you,
80|Tsubasa.
80|Meme hasn't told you about me, has he?
80|I'm Gaen Izuko. I was his senior in college.
80|He used to call me Gaen.
80|I wasn't just picking up a girl.
80|I was merely reminiscing with a familiar face I happened to run into.
80|That doesn't really matter either way.
80|If you're done with that, let's go.
80|We're racing against time here.
80|Yotsugi should be here before long, but we can't just sit around waiting.
80|Yotsugi? Who's that?
80|What does it matter to you? You don't care.
80|Some people do, though, and I'm one of them.
80|To be perfectly honest with you, I wish Meme or Deishuu were here.
80|But oh well, those two are wanderers for life.
80|By the way, I don't want Yozuru here. At all.
80|Seriously, why don't you take others into consideration before you speak?
80|You always talk under the assumption that the listener knows everything you do.
80|Tsubasa.
80|I'd normally join in on your conversation
80|and, as the adult here, buy you two drinks from a vending machine.
80|At least, that's how I'm supposed to act,
80|but we're in quite the pickle, as I just said.
80|Sorry, but I'll be taking Sode with me.
80|S-Sure.
80|That's also why I can't help you with your current tiger issues.
80|Deal with them yourself.
80|Huh?
80|Scene no. 189
80|Tiger... issues?
80|What's with that expression?
80|You don't have to be so shocked that I knew about the tiger.
80|There's nothing I don't know.
80|Nothing... you don't know?
80|Yeah.
80|Scene no. 194
80|That's what she said.
80|I know everything.
80|Scene no. 197
80|So confidently.
80|Scene no. 197
80|As if she had total control of everything in this story.
80|Scene no. 197
80|She said it.
80|Well, I'm sure you'll come to face the tiger sooner or later.
80|You'll soon name him the Hystery Tiger,
80|an oddity with power unparalleled in history.
80|Nobody can help with that, though.
80|Nobody else will save you.
80|Because it's your own problem.
80|Not mine.
80|And that boy you're in love with? It's certainly not his, either.
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|Black
80|Wha—
80|Scene no. 210
80|The boy I'm in love with?
80|Araragi Koyomi.
80|Don't tell me you didn't know.
80|You don't know anything, do you, Tsubasa?
80|You don't even know that you don't know anything.
80|You know not that you know naught, huh?
80|Scene no. 216
80|Know not that you know naught
80|Oh, that kinda sounds like I'm calling your voluptuous body naughty. How dirty of me.
80|I'm pretty petite, so you make me jealous.
80|That said, it's probably better to stay ignorant of your ignorance.
80|A wise scarecrow once said that knowing that you were brainless is the most painful thing of all.
80|What...
80|What do you know about me?!
80|Everything.
80|Like I said, I know everything.
80|I even know that you don't know anything.
80|You don't need to be ashamed of that, though.
80|The same goes for everyone else in the world.
80|Completely unaware, they fool each other as they lead their lives.
80|You're no exception.
80|You're not special.
80|Scene no. 229
80|Said Gaen.
80|Not an exception, and not special.
80|Scene no. 230
80|As if she were looking down on me.
80|It makes you happy to hear that, doesn't it?
80|Red
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|I know it does.
80|Of course,
80|I also know that the abandoned cram school, home to so many memories for you all, including Meme,
80|burned down to the ground last night.
80|Oh, was this also information that you were not privy to,
80|Little Miss "I don't know everything" Tsubasa?
80|Scene no. 240
80|On my way back from school—
80|Wait, I can't really call it that,
80|because I took a detour instead of going straight back to the Araragi residence.
80|Yeah, I know.
80|I know that Araragi and Kanbaru had nothing to do with the fire.
80|Well, I don't know, but the other side of me does.
80|Mitsüi Logistics
80|I probably know because I saw it last night as Black Hanekawa.
80|So Gaen was right.
80|This is my personal affair.
80|Scene no. 284
80|Time passes
80|Municipal Library
80|"Hystery Tiger," was it?
80|Scene no. 288
80|Occult
80|I didn't find any reference to any oddities or apparitions named that.
80|Hang on.
80|A new release, huh?
80|Scene no. 297
80|New releases—
80|A new release.
80|Scene no. 297
80|New variety.
80|A new variety.
80|Scene no. 298
80|I suddenly came up with something—
80|Scene no. 297
80|No, no, it's not right to say I came up with it.
80|If I can't even find a clue with this much research,
80|Scene no. 297
80|Because Gaen said it right from the start.
80|then maybe that tiger is, like Black Hanekawa, a new type of oddity?
80|Scene no. 297
80|That this would be an oddity I'd name personally.
80|Scene no. 300
80|Namishiro Park
80|The hysteria of tyrants causes more harm than tigers.
80|Scene no. 301
80|What if "Hystery Tiger" isn't short for "the hysteria of tyrants causes more harm than tigers,"
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|Black
80|but for "a tiger that's just as hysterical as a tyrant"?
80|I think that'd mean it was a tiger that surpasses the others.
80|What do you think?
80|I'm not sure.
80|I kinda get the feeling you're being manipulated by this woman called Gaen.
80|The way you spoke about it, it doesn't feel like you named it at all.
80|It was clearly her doing.
80|Well, yeah.
80|By the way, she's probably related to Kanbaru.
80|Huh?
80|If I'm not mistaken, Gaen was her mother's maiden name.
80|Kanbaru herself said that she used to be called Gaen Suruga.
80|We can't brush this off as mere coincidence or assume that they're either unrelated or distant relatives.
80|Indeed.
80|Scene no. 320
80|Gaen Izuko's — line
80|Yeah. I know everything.
80|"Hystery Tiger," you say?
80|Scene no. 322
80|Assuming
80|Assuming we put all our eggs in one basket and trust this Gaen,
80|if someone said "hystery" out loud, I'd think they were talking about the past.
80|Like "history," you mean?
80|Fits better than fierce or hysterical tyrant, right?
80|Maybe it could refer to some kind of trauma tigger—
80|Tigger?
80|Whoops, I meant to say "trigger." No pun intended.
80|Lilac
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|It would've been a bad one anyway.
80|Scene no. 327
80|History— and Hystery, huh?
80|History and Hystery, huh?
80|Name aside, I think that oddity is one that brings about disaster,
80|unlike my crab or Mayoi's snail.
80|It's more like Kanbaru's left arm.
80|Wh-What do you mean?
80|Surely you know what I'm talking about.
80|Your house and the cram school burned down one after the other.
80|They did, but there's nothing that proves that those fires are related to my meeting the tiger.
80|It really doesn't matter if those things are related.
80|Apart from the macroscopic fact that you were familiar with both of them,
80|those two locations also had something microscopic and short-term in common.
80|What?
80|Like I just said, they both burned down soon after I met the tiger—
80|That's not what I meant.
80|I was talking about how the two places you spent the night in burned down one after the other.
80|Doesn't this mean my apartment and the Araragi residence could be burned down by, say, tonight?
80|Scene no. 350
80|Yeah, it's about time I drew the curtains on this.
80|On this story of fires—this story of mine.
80|Uh, pardon my intrusion.
80|Welcome back, Tsubasa!
80|You sure took your time!
80|Where've you been?
80|I stopped by at a nearby park for a bit.
80|Have you heard from Araragi?
80|Not a peep.
80|I've had enough of his debauchery.
80|He's getting a proper ass-kicking when he gets back.
80|Scene no. 360
80|It seems Araragi,
80|Anyway, screw that screwed-up brother of mine.
80|Scene no. 360
80|even if he comes back safely, has a predicament to get out of afterward.
80|Scene no. 360
80|Not just one, but several.
80|I've been waiting for you.
80|Tsukihi's back home as well, so let's play a game.
80|I've already got some playing cards ready in the living room.
80|Cards?
80|Scene no. 360
80|It's not, like, video games then.
80|Sorry, Karen. I'm afraid I have some thinking to do alone—
80|Come on, hurry up.
80|Don't you dare think you can oppose me!
80|Okay, I got it!
80|Just let me take off my shoes!
80|I'll do it! I'll play cards!
80|Yay!
80|Scene no. 379
80|What I associate with the word "fire"?
80|That's just obvious.
80|The burning heart I possess!
80|My passion, in other words.
80|What about "flames," then?
80|Passion that burns even stronger.
80|My justice, in other words.
80|I see.
80|Is that why you two call yourselves the Fire Sisters?
80|Of course!
80|Fire Sisters, i.e. Justice Sisters!
80|The actual reason is entirely different, though.
80|We're called the Fire Sisters simply because
80|White
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|we both have the character for "fire" in our names.
80|White
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|By the way, I'd associate "fire" and "flames"
80|with feelings of love.
80|"Feelings of love..."
80|White
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|"Feelings of love," eh?
80|Yup!
80|You might not be aware of this,
80|but we don't just act like a justice league.
80|We also accept requests for love advice.
80|Really?
80|Yeah, we even gave Bro some advice once.
80|What? Araragi?
80|Scene no. 397
80|Really?
80|Scene no. 397
80|That kinda puts me off.
80|Oh yeah, I have a vague recollection of that.
80|That was back in May, I think?
80|I kinda remember him asking us stupid questions like, "What is love?"
80|Oh?
80|So he asked you about how to go about things with Senjougahara?
80|Scene no. 398
80|Why does this feel so unnatural?
80|Not sure.
80|It's been a while,
80|Lilac
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|so I've forgotten what he said back then
80|Lilac
80|Unnumbered Scene
80|and how we answered him.
80|Fury gives off a fiery feeling too, but at the end of the day, it's still related to justice.
80|Because Karen's justice is fueled by anger.
80|Anger = Justice
80|Indeed!
80|Raging fury fuels justice.
80|Either way you look at it, I guess both of us see fire as passion.
80|Passion...
80|Wait, Tsukihi. What do you mean, "either way you look at it"?
80|There's only one way. Passion equals justice.
80|But look at it this way.
80|You have passionate feelings for Mizudori, but they don't have anything to do with justice.
80|I suppose.
80|Sorry, I was mistaken.
80|Scene no. 411
80|It was an abnormal meekness.
80|Who's Mizudori?
80|Karen's boyfriend.
80|Scene no. 414
80|Mizudori
80|And my boyfriend's called Rousokuzawa.
80|Scene no. 415
80|Rousokuzawa
80|Wait, what?
80|You both have boyfriends?
80|I haven't heard anything of the sort from Araragi.
80|Oh, the way he sees it, those two don't exist.
80|Scene no. 418
80|Sounds like Araragi, all right.
80|So, what are they like?
80|Our brother!
80|I knew it. These sisters...
80|Scene no. 421
80|I regret asking.
80|It's a real pain, I tell ya.
80|We'd like Bro to approve of our relationships,
80|but he simply refuses to meet them.
80|Yeah.
80|And yet he has the nerve to introduce Senjougahara to us.
80|The nerve of that guy!
80|Now, isn't that cute?
80|What it comes down to, at the end of the day,
80|is that he's jealous of the guys he feels are stealing his precious sisters away from him.
80|He's just heartburned.
80|Heart... burned?
80|Envy.
80|Now I see it.
80|It wouldn't have been at all strange if heartburn was the keyword I'd hit upon first.
80|I mean, it's so clearly connected to fire.
80|"The way he sees it, those two don't exist."
80|In other words, he's averting his eyes from the truth.
80|Scene no. 435
80|On just that one point, we're the same.
80|He's just like me.
80|We both avert our eyes and escape from reality.
80|Surely that is caused by one of the strongest feelings people have...
80|A feeling powerful enough to be included as one of the seven deadly sins.
80|Envy.
80|Basically, I'm heartburned.
80|Scene no. 442
80|I cut my memories loose.
80|And I cut my feelings loose.
80|The conversation I had with Episode this morning is a basic example.
80|In my mind, that was a casual conversation I had with him while scared,
80|with the events of spring break in the back of my mind.
80|But in anyone else's eyes, there couldn't have been a stranger sight.
80|I was having a chat with the guy who tried to kill me.
80|How abnormal is that?
80|I might never see Araragi again.
80|This is what they call "marking" in the animal kingdom.
80|I'm sure Araragi will notice.
80|It doesn't matter if we never meet again.
80|I think he'll remember me just a little bit whenever he sleeps on this bed.
80|Scene no. 463
80|Let's settle for that. That should be enough for me.
80|All right, I'm done.

80|I don't have Black Hanekawa's memories,
80|Reference
80|but Black Hanekawa should have mine.
80|But I still personally want to tell her, an individual, about my feelings.
80|Let's feel each other's heartbeat
80|and tell each other of our feelings without lies
80|All this while, she's been carrying the burden of my dark and black sides,
80|so I want to show her my gratitude and make one final request of her.
80|A normal Friday
80|To Black Hanekawa.
80|is part of a series of days full of doubts and regrets
80|I try to think of a plan
80|to tell you of my love, but suddenly the day is over
80|I get so insecure when your eyes drift away
80|I don't want to wind up being super jealous
80|You know, I wish it was just us two
80|Don't laugh at my innocent words of love
80|Like I'd ever give up on you again
80|I desperately look for an answer
80|It's so ridiculous
80|Let's look into each other's eyes
80|discard our fear

80|Preview quiz!
80|Let's go investigate the serial arsons!
80|That sounded totally wrong.
80|Theme: Literature!
80|How reckless!
80|SF is an abbreviation of "slightly fancy."
80|I thought it was "science fiction."
80|Let's play a game where we expand this abbreviation without changing or losing any of its meaning.
80|Haven't the foggiest idea
80|I see
80|No good, huh?
80|I call it Abbreviation Shift!
80|I guarantee it's fun.
80|Really?
80|I can't even imagine how to play this game.
80|I know everything
80|Hilarious
80|We should probably
80|stay away
80|Somewhat Freaky.
80|So that's how!
80|Sixty-Five point eight percent vague.
80|That percentage is not the least bit vague. It's totally specific!
80|What?! Hystery Tiger, the culprit, went to burn Gahara's place?
80|Big trouble!
80|Significantly Fantastic.
80|It's fantasy now?
80|"Slightly Fancy" sounds closest to being right, doesn't it?
80|That didn't sound right at all!
80|Next Episode
80|Tsubasa Tiger Part Five
80|Next time on Nekomonogatari White, Episode Five:
80|Tsubasa Tiger Part Five!
80|Sister Fires!
80|Why would anyone pick a fight with Gahara?!
80|The very thought is terrifying!
80|That's strangely fitting.

81|Animation Number 3
81|Skipping to this point, even I think it's a bit unnatural.
81|I smell dirt.
81|Animation Number 8
81|I checked my feet.
81|Did I go outside while I was asleep?
81|Animation Number 8
81|I didn't find anything on the soles.
81|Like a sleepwalker?

81|Which means...
81|When they say a criminal's proof remains under their fingernails, they weren't joking.
81|Here it is. Definitive proof.
81|I see. So I'm turning into the Meddlecat again.

81|Good, it's not there. They're not growing yet.
81|It looks like a lot of things are different from the last two times.
81|Since I had no omens and didn't have to rely on Araragi-kun to change me back,
81|am I getting used to turning into Black Hanekawa?
81|But I can kind of imagine the reason why I turned into Black Hanekawa again.
81|It's not relieving stress again by thrashing around.
81|If that were so, there'd probably be more noticeable signs.
81|What a bind.
81|Is Black Hanekawa-chan going to handle this stress too?
81|Hanekawa-san.
81|Are you awake? If not, wake up!
81|It's breakfast time! It's a rule in the Araragi household for all of us to eat breakfast together.
81|Got it. Don't worry. I'm awake, so I'll be right there.
81|Okay.
81|Araragi-kun talks of his little sisters waking him every morning as if it were a nuisance.
81|But how's such a cute way to wake someone a nuisance?
81|Animation Number 48
81|What's wrong with him?
81|Animation Number 48
81|The way Araragi explains it,
81|Animation Number 48
81|one would be led to believe he's getting assulted in his sleep with a crowbar.
81|Animation Number 48
81|Holding contact lenses in one of my hands, I left Araragi's room.
81|Animation Number 48
81|Meow.
81|I'm heading out now.
81|Hanekawa-chan.
81|Animation Number 51
81|Koyomi's mother
81|I don't know about your household's circumstances, and for now, I don't plan on asking.
81|But don't consider being apart from your parents
81|and saying "I'm heading out now" from our house as normal.
81|We can entertain you as our guest, but we can't become your family.
81|Even if Karen and Tsukihi look up to you as an older sister.
81|Ah, don't get me wrong. It's not that it's any trouble.
81|Karen and Tsukihi are happy, and I want to treat you well as a guest because you're Koyomi's friend.
81|I also heard it was thanks to you that Koyomi put more effort into studying.
81|Physics
81|That isn't the case.
81|I'm sorry. I've worried you in a strange way.
81|But my family circumstances aren't that big a deal.
81|There's just a little bit of a falling out. That's all...
81|The mere fact there's a falling out between parent and child sounds like child abuse.
81|Family is something you don't need but should be happy to have.
81|That's what I think. As a mother.
81|As a mother...
81|Hanekawa-chan, people can run from things they don't like all they want.
81|But if they're just averting their eyes, they're not running.
81|Animation Number 79
81|Words of a mother
81|As long as you think the current situation's okay, no one can help.
81|For starters, I think that's about where you need to "head out" from.
81|Just averting your eyes isn't running away, huh?
81|Those are connotative words.
81|Animation Number 91
81|I came face-to-face
81|Animation Number 91
81|with a scene that made me want to avert my eyes.
81|Um...
81|Animation Number 92
81|A nasty-looking golden eye captures me.
81|Animation Number 100
81|We made eye contact.
81|Oh, hey, you.
81|Um, what was it?
81|You're that girl I totally almost killed that time, right?
81|Totally makes me laugh.
81|Hello. It's been a while, Episode-san.
81|I heard you went back to your home country right after that incident, so why are you back, Episode-san?
81|Totally makes me laugh. Don't "Episode-san" me.
81|I'm not old enough for that "-san" speak and not titled enough for formal speaking.
81|Even though you're only half-vampire, your life span is pretty long, right?
81|A long life span doesn't make me old, right? Totally makes me laugh!
81|This is actually a secret, but I'm so amused I'll tell you. Actually, you're a lot older than I am.
81|Because right now, I'm six years old.
81|Six?
81|Animation Number 115
81|I couldn't help it, but I was obviously surprised.
81|Well, just shows you not to judge a person by how they look. Though I'm not a human.
81|So will you answer my question regarding what brought you back to this town?
81|You're really persistent about that, huh?
81|Well, I owe you, so I'd like to answer you.
81|Animation Number 120
81|Looks like trying to kill me
81|Animation Number 120
81|is something he at least considers a debt.
81|But I still don't know why I'm back in this town myself.
81|I got called in and arrived this morning on a red-eye bus.
81|A red-eye bus?
81|Are you a tourist?
81|Animation Number 121
81|Are you a tourist?
81|Called in?
81|Of course. I'm basically a freelance vampire hunter. Not like Dramaturgie or Guillotine Cutter.
81|If the cash reward's good, I'm for hire. I'm a mercenary for personal gain.
81|Hired without knowing the case?
81|They paid up front, and I also had reasons why I had to accept.
81|I don't care about the case.
81|Then could you be hired to go tiger hunting, too?
81|Tiger hunting?
81|Well, no, I'm a hunter specializing in vampires, so tigers and stuff are kinda...
81|But, Hanekawa Tsubasa, was it? You've gotten like, really normal since we last met.
81|I mean, just now,
81|the "vision" I have as a vampire couldn't tell if you were the same person or not.
81|Last time I got, kind of,
81|a dreadful feeling from you. It's gone without a trace now.
81|No, not gone without a trace. More like it was cut off from you, leaving nothing behind.
81|Animation Number 150
81|I got what he was trying to say.
81|Animation Number 150
81|But hold it right there.
81|Animation Number 150
81|This train of thought—
81|Animation Number 150
81|won't lead to anything good.
81|It's her, it's her! The one who called me here without telling me about the case.
81|Well, when I heard she was an upperclassman to that Hawaiian-shirt Oshino Meme guy in college
81|I had to accept this case because of my relationship with that guy.
81|Hey, 'Sode. You were taking forever to come to the meeting place, so I came to pick you up.
81|And it seems you're in the middle of hitting on a girl. Sorry to interrupt.
81|Oh, is that girl there Hanekawa Tsubasa-san?
81|Yes, that's me.
81|What a coincidence.
81|I'm pleased I decided to move on a whim and got to meet you,
81|Tsubasa-chan.
81|I'm sure Meme didn't tell you, but I'm his senpai, a human named Gaen Izuko.
81|He called me Gaen-senpai.
81|Don't say "hitting on." I was just relishing in old memories because I saw a familiar face.
81|Well, that doesn't matter.
81|If that talk of old memories is over, let's be on our way. Every second counts for us.
81|Yotsugi will follow us, but we can't wait.
81|Yotsugi? Who's that?
81|It doesn't matter for you.
81|It does matter for certain people, like me.
81|No, to tell the truth, I wish either Meme or Deishu were here.
81|But they're very much vagabonds. As for Yozuru, I don't want her here at all.
81|You really talk for yourself. Like you talk assuming the other side knows what you know.
81|Tsubasa-chan, if things were normal, I'd join in the chat with 'Sode.
81|As an adult, I should probably even buy you two some juice at a vending machine.
81|But it's like I said. Sorry, but I'm taking 'Sode.
81|Okay.
81|So I can't help you with the tiger problem you're carrying around right now.
81|You'll have to take care of that yourself somehow.
81|Animation Number 189
81|Tiger— issues?
81|What's that weird look for?
81|Knowing about the tiger isn't so surprising.
81|There's nothing I don't know.
81|Nothing you don't know...
81|Yeah.
81|Animation Number 194
81|She said it.
81|I know everything.
81|Animation Number 197
81|So confidently.
81|Animation Number 197
81|As if she had total control of everything in this story.
81|Animation Number 197
81|She said.
81|Well, I'm sure you'll be facing the tiger either today or tomorrow.
81|You'll face the one you're about to name the "History Tiger."
81|The aberration with strength unparalleled in history.
81|But nobody can help you with that. Nobody can rescue you.
81|Because it's a problem you yourself have.
81|That's not my problem, and of course it's not the problem of the boy you're in love with.
81|Animation Number 210
81|The boy I'm in love with?
81|I'm talking about Araragi Koyomi-kun. You really didn't know?
81|You really don't know anything, Tsubasa-chan. You don't even know that you don't know anything.
81|It's not wisdom to realize one's ignorance. It's ignorance.
81|Animation Number 216
81|It's not wisdom to realize one's ignorance.
81|Saying "muchi" so much makes it sound naughty, like the word for a voluptuous body.
81|I do feel jealous since I'm the slender type.
81|Though it's probably better to not know of one's ignorance.
81|Nothing's worse than the truth you're an idiot, like the lament of the scarecrow without a brain.
81|You... What do you know about me?
81|I know everything. As I said, I know everything.
81|I know that you don't know anything, but that's nothing to be ashamed of.
81|All humans in this world don't know anything. They unwittingly live using every trick in the book.
81|You're no exception. You're not special.
81|Animation Number 229
81|Said Gaen.
81|Not an exception, not special.
81|Animation Number 230
81|As if she were looking down on me.
81|You like when people say that.
81|I know that.
81|Of course, I know that the cram-school ruins,
81|a location you guys, including Meme, look back on with fond memories, burned down last night.
81|Oh, this was also information you weren't aware of,
81|Tsubasa-chan, who doesn't know everything.
81|On my way back from school. No, I can't say that.
81|Because I was planning a detour, not heading straight to the Araragi house.
81|That's right. I know that the fire was something that has nothing to do with Araragi-kun or Kanbaru-san.
81|I don't know, but the me that isn't me knows.
81|I probably know because I saw it last night as Black Hanekawa.
81|Mitsüi Logistics
81|So like Gaen-san said, this is my own problem.
81|Animation Number 284
81|Time passes
81|Gaen-san said the "History Tiger", didn't she?
81|Municipal Library
81|Occult
81|No books listed an aberration or transformed monster named the "History Tiger".
81|Wait a minute.
81|New releases?
81|New releases.
81|New variety.
81|Animation Number 298
81|I suddenly came up with something—
81|If this much research can't catch one hint,
81|Animation Number 297
81|Because Gaen said it right from the start.
81|what if that tiger is a new type of aberration just like Black Hanekawa?
81|Animation Number 297
81|That this would be an aberration I'd name personally.
81|Namishiro Park
81|The hysteria of tyrants causes more harm than tigers.
81|Animation Number 301
81|So if Hysteria Tiger isn't short for "The hysteria of tyrants causes more damage than tigers,"
81|I'd think it's a tiger worse than a tyrant. A tiger that surpasses all tigers in history.
81|What do you think?
81|I'm not sure.
81|It feels like you're being guided as this Gaen lady wishes.
81|From your story, it's not you who named it, no matter how I think about it, she did.
81|Well, that's true.
81|By the way, I think she's related to Kanbaru.
81|I believe her mother's maiden name was Gaen. Kanbaru herself said she used to be Gaen Suruga.
81|It's a bit too unique to be a coincidence, a distant relative, or not be related.
81|You're right.
81|Yes. I know everything.
81|"History Tiger", was it?
81|Let's say you were brave and trusted Gaen-san.
81|If someone said "History," I'd associate it with "the past."
81|As in "former"?
81|It fits better than writing it with "fire" and "tiger." Combined with a traumatic meaning.
81|Trauma?
81|Oh no, that sounds like a pun.
81|It's prone to happen.
81|History and Hysteria, huh?
81|Animation Number 327
81|History— and Hysteria, huh?
81|But naming aside, doesn't that aberration seem fairly dangerous?
81|That's right. Unlike my crab or Mayoi-chan's snail,
81|it's like Kanbaru's left arm.
81|What do you mean?
81|What do I mean?
81|There's no way you don't know.
81|The ruins were burned down right after your house, right?
81|Yes, that's right. There's no proof that links them to me meeting the tiger though.
81|It doesn't matter if there are any links there.
81|There's a common thread to those two places besides the macroview that you knew them well.
81|A microview, a common thread in a very short time span.
81|The fact they burned right after I saw the tiger that day.
81|That's not it. I mean the places where you spent the night burned down one after another.
81|So if this continues, my apartment and Araragi-kun's house
81|will sadly be burned to a crisp tonight, no?
81|That's right. It's about time I settled this.
81|This story about fires... about me...
81|Um, excuse me.
81|Welcome back, Tsubasa-san. You're pretty late. Where'd you go?
81|I was hanging out at the park for a bit.
81|Any word from Araragi-kun?
81|Actually, no.
81|He can only debauch so much. I'll punt him hard when he's back.
81|Well, who cares about a petty big brother.
81|Animation Number 360
81|It seems Araragi,
81|Animation Number 360
81|even if he comes back safely, has a predicament to overcome afterwards.
81|Animation Number 360
81|Not just one, but several.
81|I was waiting for you.
81|Tsukihi-chan's back, so let's play. I already got some playing cards on the coffee table.
81|Playing cards?
81|Animation Number 360
81|It's not, like, video games then.
81|Oh, I'm sorry, Karen-chan. I need to think-
81|Come on! Don't think you can resist...
81|Wai-! I got it! Let me take off my shoes!
81|I'll do it! I'll play cards!
81|Hurray!
81|Something to associate with "fire"? There's only one thing.
81|The hot heart beating in my chest. In a word, passion.
81|Then what do you associate with "flame"?
81|The hot passion is even hotter. In a word, justice.
81|Hmm, I see.
81|That's why you call yourselves the Fire Sisters?
81|That's right! Fire Sisters means sisters of justice!
81|Actually, it's completely different.
81|We're called the Fire Sisters simply because
81|the kanji for "fire" is in our names.
81|By the way, I'd associate "fire" and "flame" with a heart in love.
81|A heart in love.
81|A heart in love, huh?
81|Well, you might not know this,
81|but we don't act just for justice. We also give romantic advice.
81|You do?
81|We even gave Onii-chan advice about his romance.
81|Araragi-kun?
81|Animation Number 397
81|Really.
81|Animation Number 397
81|That kinda puts me off.
81|Come to think of it, there was something like that. Around May?
81|He asked a newbie question like, "What's it mean to be in love?"
81|I see. So in other words, he sought advice from you two about Senjougahara-san?
81|Animation Number 398
81|Why does this feel so unnatural?
81|Hmm... I don't know. We're talking about a while back.
81|I've forgotten what he was talking about
81|and how we answered.
81|Anger has that "fire" feeling too, but that's more like what Karen-chan said about justice.
81|For her, justice is anger.
81|Anger = Justice
81|That's right!
81|Anger's a flame and therefore justice!
81|In any case, "passionate feelings" is the mutual understanding for me and Karen-chan.
81|Passionate feelings...
81|What do you mean, "in any case," Tsukihi-chan? Passionate feelings equals justice.
81|But your feelings towards Mizudori-kun aren't justice, but they're still passionate, right?
81|I guess so. Sorry. I was wrong.
81|Animation Number 411
81|It was an abnormal meekness
81|Mizudori-kun?
81|Karen-chan's boyfriend.
81|Animation Number 414
81|Mizudori-kun
81|And my boyfriend's name is Rousokuzawa-kun.
81|Animation Number 415
81|Rousokuzawa-kun
81|What? You both have boyfriends? I hadn't heard anything from Araragi-kun.
81|Oh, yeah. Those two don't exist inside his head.
81|Animation Number 418
81|Sounds like Araragi-kun, all right.
81|So what are they like?
81|Just like our brother!
81|These two really are...
81|Animation Number 421
81|I regret asking.
81|It's a pain. I'd like it officially approved by our brother,
81|but for some reason he refuses to meet either of them.
81|Right. Yet he had the nerve to introduce Senjougahara-san to us. He's got some nerve.
81|Isn't that cute.
81|It boils down to him feeling like his cute little sisters are being taken from him.
81|So he's envious of those two. He's just being jealous.
81|Being jealous?
81|Envy.
81|Oh, that's right.
81|That's another keyword associated with "fire" that might be the first one that comes to mind.
81|Put another way, the fact they don't exist in Araragi-kun's mind means he's averting his eyes from the truth.
81|Just like me. Averting my eyes. Turning away from reality.
81|Simply put, that's one of the strongest feelings humans have.
81|So strong it counts as one of the seven cardinal sins. Surely it's envy.
81|So I'm jealous...
81|Cutting away memory. Cutting away my heart.
81|It's easy to grasp if I think about my conversation with Episode-kun this morning.
81|I thought I was trying to remember what happened during spring break, though I was slightly scared.
81|But there couldn't have been a stranger sight.
81|I was chatting with someone who tried to kill me.
81|Could there be such an abnormal story?
81|I might not be able to see Araragi-kun again...
81|This is what's called "marking" in the animal world.
81|I'm sure Araragi-kun will notice. Even if I never see him again.
81|When he sleeps on this bed, maybe he'll remember me, even just a little.

82|Nice to meet you
82|Dear Black Hanekawa,
82|It may seem strange, but it's nice to meet you.
82|I'm Hanekawa Tsubasa.
82|First things first, allow me to express my gratitude.
82|Be it back during Golden Week, or before the culture festival,
82|you went through great pains in my stead.
82|I want to thank you for it.
82|I truly feel bad for causing you trouble all the time.
82|I've finally come to the realization that burying you after you were run over
82|was probably nothing but an act of self-righteousness.
82|And you became bound to me because of it.
82|I'm sure I can't atone for that sin, no matter how much I try.
82|Eraser
82|For Pencil
82|I'm fully aware that it leaves me in no position to ask this of you,
82|but I'm afraid I'll hurt my precious friends if I stay this way,
82|so I have no choice but to rely on you.
82|You're the only one I can turn to.
82|That's why I utter these words for the first time in my life...
82|Help.
82|Please help.
82|Please help me
82|Please help me.
82|It's not fair
82|That you blame it all on the smile you showed me alone
82|I close my eyes one last time
82|And burn it into my memory
82|Every moment I spent with you now petrifies me
82|But at the same time, it encourages me to move on
82|I never knew everything, you see
82|But I had realized
82|That it was time to awaken from my slumber
82|Even if it meant facing a future where we weren't together
82|Episode Courteousness
82|Tsubasa Tiger Part Five
82|Font used in the video: HGP Mincho B
82|Now I know what that huge Hystery Tiger is.
82|Just like you, it's a new type of oddity born from my mind.
82|To be precise,
82|it's a new oddity that my heart cut loose from me.
82|Just like you are the incarnation of my stress,
82|the Hystery Tiger is an incarnation of my envy.
82|To be honest, the word "envy" had absolutely nothing to do with me until just two days ago.
82|It was only three days ago that it skyrocketed.
82|On that day, the first day of the new term,
82|I headed to the dining room to have breakfast, only to see
82|the person supposed to be my father
82|and the person supposed to be my mother
82|helping themselves before I got there.
82|I clearly witnessed it right then.
82|I clearly saw them having the same thing for breakfast.
82|The sight of them trying to go back to being a family gave me heartburn.
82|My heart burned with the fury of a thousand suns.
82|My level of envy crossed a threshold,
82|giving birth to the Hystery Tiger.
82|I simply want to draw the curtains on all of this.
82|Not just on the Hystery Tiger,
82|but on you as well.
82|I'll stop averting my eyes and look straight ahead.
82|So please, Black Hanekawa. I beg of you.
82|Come back to me.
82|Return to my heart.
82|Come back home, along with the Hystery Tiger.
82|Please.
82|Please, I beg of you.
82|Be it stress, envy, anxiety, agony, risk, or the profound darkness,
82|I hereby swear to love them all.
82|I know this is a shameless request,
82|but I've decided to be more shameless.
82|Araragi will probably be disappointed in me.
82|Because the merits he sees in me are just,
82|as Senjougahara called them,
82|my pure whiteness
82|and my deficiencies in the wild.
82|I don't want to let him down.
82|I have never once told him that I love him.
82|I fell in love with him and ended up with a broken heart, all by myself.
82|Black Hanekawa.
82|This is truly my final request.
82|This will be the last time I force you to play a difficult role.
82|Please save our little sister.
82|She has run away from home and is currently playing with fire.
82|She's a real problem child,
82|but I'll always be waiting for her to come back home.
82|I'll love the two of you,
82|and I'll love myself.
82|Immigration Officer
82|Sincerely
82|Sincerely.
82|...is what she wrote.
82|Scene no. 19
82|Meow.
82|The biggest mistake my meowster's making is the fact that she's calling me her family.
82|Please, I'm just a pet cat.
82|No, a stray cat, I suppose
82|Scene no. 24
82|My meowster has the right idea.
82|I'm an oddity that's fated to disappear someday.
82|The Hystery Tiger may very well be the same.
82|Left alone, it might exhaust its burning emotions and vanish without a trace.
82|So there might be no purressing need for my meowster to purrden herself with it.
82|Forget being something she's not.
82|This might even have adverse effects on her.
82|I'm a nuisance to her,
82|and so is the Hystery Tiger.
82|But y'know, she begged me to do it.
82|I had nowhere to go, but I do now.
82|I have a home now.
82|Why is that enough to make me feel like I can do anything?
82|This makes me so happy.
82|It almost brings a tear to my eye.
82|Scene no. 29
82|That said, I'm not going to shed any.
82|I'm a cat.
82|I'll cry, but I won't shed tears.
82|Scene no. 29
82|Meow.
82|Sincerely
82|Reference
82|All right, then.
82|Let me do my meowster one last service.
82|White
82|Unnumbered Scene
82|I'm off.
82|I am a tiger.
82|The name's Hystery.
82|I have a pretty good idea of where I was born.
82|I remember sobbing in a dark, depressing place.
82|It's not just envy.
82|I'm comprised of every dark emotion out there.
82|After the moment I was born,
82|I saw the person who gave birth to me.
82|I suppose I should call her my twin sister rather than my mother.
82|Looks like the fires raging in my heart were caused by that sister of mine.
82|By that strong, sturdy, fearful, fragile,
82|and completely white sister of mine.
82|White, pure white, snow white, and crystal clear,
82|my beautiful sister does not resemble me in the slightest.
82|She looked truly beautiful.
82|It makes me proud to think that I'm the one that's sustaining her beauty, her whiteness.
82|But that matters not.
82|Everything must be burned.
82|Everything that gives me heartburn.
82|The father, the mother, friends, and juniors—they all give me heartburn.
82|Car Park
82|They should just disappear.
82|They should just die.
82|Let them suffer.
82|Let them feel sorrow.
82|Let them cry like me.
82|Now, what shall be burned tonight?
82|What should be engulfed in my flames?
82|This building, I suppose.
82|I see.
82|This seems more simple than burning a single house or a whole building.
82|Well, its level of simplicity makes no difference to me.
82|Now that I've settled on a target, there's no point in hesitating.
82|Tamikura-sou
82|Everything is the same.
82|I don't know everything,
82|but I know that everything burns.
82|Meow.
82|Scene no. 67
82|Hey there, Tiger.
82|I'm here to pick you up.
82|Let's go home.
82|Move.
82|I am going to burn that thing there.
82|You're in the way.
82|Meowster doesn't want you to.
82|I don't particularly care what she wants.
82|You're free to call her your master,
82|but she's nothing to me.
82|She's nothing but the source of my burning desires.
82|Don't go calling her nothing, Tiger.
82|She's our mother.
82|Mother?
82|How worthless.
82|Is she not the one most aware of a mother's worthlessness?
82|That may be true.
82|That may very well be why she called us her little sisters instead of her daughters.
82|Little sisters?
82|I don't furry understand it,
82|but appurrently it gets them hot.
82|According to what that human said, anyway.
82|You're hot
82|Scene no. 91
82|That might be the meowst appropriate title for a burning hot character like you.
82|Burning hot
82|Scene no. 93
82|I have no interest in titles.
82|I am but a natural phenomenon that burns anything it wants.
82|Something like an automatic machine.
82|Nothing would get me hot.
82|That so?
82|Hey, Tiger.
82|What do you want, Cat?
82|Let me make this purrfectly clear.
82|Purrsonally, I have no intentions of complaining about what you've done so far.
82|You burned down the house, but I have no intentions of holding it against you.
82|Arson's just a human concept, after all.
82|Indeed. Then—
82|However...
82|I believe I told you that I wouldn't let you get away with it if you hurt my meowster.
82|What a strange thing to say.
82|I couldn't care less about that woman,
82|which is why I don't have the slightest intention of hurting her.
82|But the desire to burn down that apartment
82|came from none other than your master in the first place.
82|My meowster was jealous of the Senjougahara household.
82|Scene no. 105
82|So jealous she wanted it torched.
82|Scene no. 105
82|That is true.
82|Scene no. 105
82|But you know.
82|Scene no. 105
82|It's also true that she wanted to suppurress that envy of hers.
82|You seem to be ignoring that, Tiger.
82|Silence!
82|Is that not what gave birth to me, an oddity?
82|You reap what you sow.
82|My flames don't care about such circumstances.
82|They just burn.
82|As if to wash everything away.
82|As if to wipe the slate clean.
82|They just burn everything to the ground.
82|I'm the one not really
82|Scene no. 115
82|Well, you're a more proper oddity than I am.
82|doing something normal
82|Scene no. 115

82|Hoshinomiya
82|2-4-101
82|The one living in the apartment you're trying to burn right now is my meowster's friend.
82|Considering how late it is,
82|this place won't just be empty like the other two you burned down.
82|I'm sure my meowster will cry if that woman dies.
82|I must purrevent that at all costs.
82|I can guarantee that it won't happen.
82|She won't cry.
82|If she ever wants to, she'll cut those feelings loose.
82|When she's unhappy, she'll cut the unhappiness loose.
82|That's how she's lived for the past eighteen years.
82|By giving birth to you and me.
82|No.
82|That's how she'll live the rest of her life.
82|By giving birth to tons of monsters.
82|She alone will stay pure, white, and crystal clear.
82|She'll never hate anyone.
82|She'll never hold a grudge.
82|She'll be nice to everyone, love them all, and live a beautiful life.
82|She'll always be the real thing.
82|White
82|Unnumbered Scene
82|No.
82|And I'll—
82|No, this isn't meow.
82|It isn't meow.
82|This is me.
82|I'm Hanekawa Tsubasa,
82|and I reject that claim!
82|White
82|Unnumbered Scene
82|I decided to bring this to an end.
82|I'll probably come to hate people.
82|I won't be able to treat everyone nicely like before,
82|and I won't be able to love them all.
82|I'm sure people will dislike, and probably even hate me.
82|I'll become more short-tempered and find it impossible to forgive people.
82|I might become stupid.
82|I might stop smiling.
82|I might weep.
82|But that's fine!
82|It's all right!
82|I don't want to be the real thing. I just want to be human.
82|I don't care if I'm not beautiful.
82|I don't care if I'm not "white."
82|I want to become stained, just like you two!
82|Come back home.
82|It's past your curfew.
82|Let's eat together.
82|Silence!
82|So damn hot!
82|Don't push yourself, Cat.
82|Animals are meant to be afraid of fire.
82|So why do you embrace it?
82|Forget the laws of oddities, your actions defy the very laws of nature.
82|Shut up!
82|You don't have to tell me!
82|I may be stupid,
82|but even I can tell that a cat can't beat a tiger!
82|Then why do you try to do the impossible?
82|Why act so recklessly?
82|Why do the futile?
82|Because my meowster begged me to!
82|Not like you'd understand.
82|Scene no. 203
82|She wants to take care of everything herself.
82|Scene no. 203
82|You have no idea how happy it makes me when she needs me.
82|Scene no. 203
82|She felt no shame doing so.
82|Scene no. 203
82|She called me her little sister.
82|Scene no. 203

82|Is that all you've got?
82|It that as far as your gratitude goes?
82|Very well.
82|We were born of the same mother.
82|I'll personally drag you to the depths of Hell!
82|Aw, and here I was so happy about the whole thing.
82|I put my life on the line, and all I managed to do was delay your arson by ten seconds?

82|Scene no. 239
82|I told you so.
82|It's impossible, reckless, and futile.
82|It was impossible, reckless, and futile.
82|I never did get the chance to tell him.
82|I loved him so much.
82|I loved him so much I even turned into a monster.
82|Yet I never once managed to tell Araragi that I loved him.
82|It was impossible, reckless, and futile.
82|No, it wasn't, Hanekawa.
82|It's a sword that's rather familiar to meow, and to me.
82|The Demon Sword, Heart Span.
82|Sure, it may have been impossible for you.
82|Reckless, even.
82|However, it wasn't futile.
82|If you hadn't put your life on the line and managed to delay this tiger's arson by ten seconds,
82|I wouldn't have made it in time.
82|And I'm sure that would've made me cry.

82|That hurts, you know.
82|You were in big trouble.
82|Did you really think I wouldn't rush to help you?
82|Listen to yourself.
82|Ow!
82|It's so hot! Ow!
82|I'm burning up!
82|Oops.
82|Uh, are you Black Hanekawa right now?
82|Or are you just Hanekawa?
82|But wait, you've still got your cat ears and your white hair.
82|It's all me.
82|That so?
82|Well?
82|You aren't gonna exterminate it, right?
82|I'm sorry, but I went and read that letter.
82|I gave it a fatal wound with the Heart Span, so it won't be able to last long.
82|You'd better hurry up if you wanna absorb it.
82|You know everything, don't you?

82|Will you go out with me and marry me someday?
82|Finally I had the courage.
82|Scene no. 325
82|Oh.
82|I can't tell you how happy that makes me.
82|But I'm sorry.
82|I'm in love with someone else now.
82|Thought as much.
82|I knew as much.
82|Do you love her more than me?
82|I do.
82|Aw, I got rejected.
82|Yeah.
82|Scene no. 334
82|I can accept this.
82|Scene no. 336
82|This is how it should be.
82|Scene no. 338
82|I confessed to him and got turned down.
82|Scene no. 340
82|I'm heartbroken.
82|Scene no. 342
82|Finally I get
82|Scene no. 344
82|an answer.
82|Scene no. 346
82|He turned me down
82|Scene no. 348
82|and I can finally be sad.
82|Scene no. 350
82|Scene no. 363
82|Around ten days later,
82|Tamikura-sou
82|the Hanekawas found a house to rent as a replacement for the one that burned down.
82|My cat ears are gone and I don't see the Hystery Tiger around anymore,
82|but my hair is now black and white, kinda like tiger stripes.
82|It's a bit too, uh, "innovative" a hairdo for school,
82|so I dye it black each morning.
82|The house we rented wasn't all that big.
82|Actually, it's somewhat on the smaller side for this locality.
82|You can't say it has a lot of rooms either.
82|Scene no. 368
82|It doesn't matter, though. I'd already spoken to the people that are supposed to be my parents.

82|Dad. Mom.
82|Please give me a room.
82|So.
82|s374
82|For the first time in my life, I had a room of my own.
82|I didn't want the little sisters in my heart to feel cramped for room.
82|This house is a total stranger to me,
82|but I don't feel like I'm sneaking into a stranger's house.
82|It actually feels like a house I'm completely used to living in.
82|I can't believe you can feel this way just by unlocking the front door yourself.
82|Suddenly I remembered.
82|Scene no. 382
82|Well, well, if it isn't Hanekawa!
82|Her — Hachikuji Mayoi
82|Scene no. 80
82|The Lost Cow.
82|I'd lost sight of my family and my home, so it was a rather appropriate oddity to run into.
82|I'd been lost ever since I met Mayoi at that park in May.
82|I was going around in circles.
82|I was wandering all over the place.
82|Thanks to that, though, I was able to meet tons of people.
82|Ventilation Fan
82|I was able to see tons of different families,
82|and many different sides of myself.
82|That's how I became the person I am now.
82|My past self is a part of me,
82|and so is my future self.
82|There isn't a single moment where I'm not myself.
82|I wonder what I'll be like tomorrow, then.
82|This is a greeting that everyone says like it's the most natural thing in the world.
82|But to me, these are words I'll be uttering for the first time in my life.
82|I'm home
82|I'm home.

83|Nice to meet you
83|To Black Hanekawa-san. Nice to meet you. I know that sounds strange, because I'm Hanekawa Tsubasa.
83|First, allow me to thank you.
83|Thank you for your bone-breaking labor for my sake during Golden Week and before the school festival.
83|I really do feel apologetic that I've only been causing you trouble.
83|Especially now, l feel the reason you were initially attracted to me was not for my selfish ego.
83|My responsibility for tying you to me is not something I can ever fully make up for.
83|Eraser

83|So I'm not really in a position to ask something like this of you,
83|but if I don't do anything, my precious friends will be hurt as a result.
83|I have no choice but to rely on you. I only have you to rely on.
83|So I'm saying this to someone for the first time.
83|Help. Please help.

83|Tsubasa Tiger Part Five
83|Font used in the video: HGP Mincho B
83|The true nature of that giant tiger named the History Tiger
83|is a new aberration my heart created in a similar way I created you.
83|To be more precise, it's a new aberration that my heart has freshly cut off from itself.
83|If I say you're the incarnation of stress, the History Tiger is the incarnation of envy.
83|Yet, to be honest, I really had nothing to do with this term called "envy" until just two days ago.
83|However, the total amount of that envy surpassed what you'd call activation energy three days ago.
83|That day... The day of the new semester.
83|What I saw when I headed to the dining room for breakfast,
83|were the ones I would call "Father" and "Mother" already eating their breakfast.
83|At that time, I saw it clearly with my own eyes.
83|The fact that he and she had been eating the exact same menu for their breakfasts.
83|I was completely jealous of them returning to being a family after all we've been through.
83|I felt like I would burn up, I was so jealous.
83|That alone was more than enough to be activation energy, and the History Tiger was created.
83|However, I feel I should no longer continue doing things of this sort.
83|Not just regarding the History Tiger, but regarding you as well.
83|I'm going to redirect my averted gaze towards the front.
83|So I ask of you, Black Hanekawa-san.
83|Please come back. Please return into my heart.
83|Please come back here with the History Tiger.
83|Please. Please, I beg of you.
83|Stress and envy. Anxiety and agony. Bad possibilities and deep shadows.
83|I swear right here that I will love all of it.
83|I know this is a shameless favor. But I decided I'm going to be shameless from now on.
83|Araragi-kun will probably be disappointed.
83|Because the only value he sees in me
83|is what Senjougahara-san calls my pure whiteness; the lack of wildness.
83|I don't want to disappoint Araragi-kun.
83|I ended up never telling him I loved him even once.
83|I fell in love on my own, and I lost that love on my own.
83|Black Hanekawa-san. This is truly my last wish.
83|This is the last time I'll force a tough job on you.
83|Please rescue our one other younger sister.
83|She ran from home, is busy playing with fire, and is really nothing but trouble,
83|but I will wait as long as it takes for her to come back home.
83|I will love both of you, and I will love myself.
83|Immigration Officer
83|Sincerely
83|Sincerely yours, and apologies for the brevity.
83|...is what she wrote
83|Animation Number 19
83|Nyaa.
83|My myaster's biggest mistake was calling something like me "family."
83|I'm nothing more than a pet cat.
83|No, a stray cat, I suppose
83|Animation Number 24
83|As my myaster is aware, I'm nothing but an aberration that'll disappear in time.
83|The History Tiger may be like that too.
83|Unsupurrvised, it may someday release all its emotional flames and vanish without a trace.
83|So there might not be a reason for her to bear this burden.
83|Not only that, but taking action might make myatters worse.
83|I'm in her way, and so is the History Tiger.
83|But you know, if she's asking me...
83|Just because my myeandering self found a place to go back to...
83|Just by having a home to go back to... Why do I feel like I can do anything?
83|This makes me so happy. It makes me want to cry.
83|Animation Number 29
83|But then, I'm not really going to cry. I'm a cat. I don't cry. I just meow.
83|Animation Number 29
83|Meowww.
83|Sincerely
83|Reference
83|Well then, this'll be my last bit of service to my myaster.
83|I'm on my way.
83|I am a tiger. My name is the History Tiger. I have a vague idea where I was born.
83|All I remember is sobbing away in a dimly lit, damp place.
83|I consist not only of envy, but of all negative emotions.
83|The moment after I was born, I saw the maternal body that had created me.
83|Or should I say twin sister instead of mother?
83|It seems the flames within my heart resulted from that elder sister.
83|Strong, tough, scary, and fragile. That pure-white elder sister.
83|Pure white, innocent... So white... The whitest of whites.
83|A beautiful elder sister I could never be similar to.
83|She really was beautiful.
83|To think that such beauty, such whiteness, was being supported by myself. I feel proud.
83|But none of that matters.
83|I must burn everything down. Within me, anything and everything is to be envied.
83|Fathers, mothers, friends, and underclassmen are to be envied. They can go away.
83|Car Park
83|They should all disappear. They should feel pain. They should feel sadness. They should all cry like me.
83|Now what shall I burn tonight? What shall I feed to my fire?
83|For now, should this building be next?
83|I see. It seems a bit easier than burning down an entire home or building.
83|Well, easy or troublesome, it's all the same. No need for hesitation once the target's set.
83|They're all the same.
83|Tamikura-sou
83|I don't know everything, but everything burns.
83|Meow.
83|Hey, tiger. I'm here to pick you up. Let's go home together.
83|Stand aside. I wish to burn that thing over there. You are hindering me.
83|My myaster doesn't wish for something like that.
83|I know nothing of whether that girl wishes it or not.
83|It's your own will to call her "master" or not, but that girl means nothing to me.
83|She's just the source of the pyromaniac urge.
83|You can't say she's nothing, tiger. She's like our nyatural parent.
83|Natural parent? Now that is nonsense.
83|Doesn't she know better than anyone that the concept of "natural parents" is nonsense?
83|Ah, maybe so. That might be why my myaster called us "little sisters" instead of "daughters."
83|Sisters?
83|I'm not really sure, but apparently people's hearts burn for them according to that humyan guy.
83|It might be the perfect title for a burning character like you.
83|You're burning
83|Animation Number 91
83|Burning hot
83|Animation Number 93
83|I have no interest in titles. I am nothing but a natural phenomenon that burns what I want.
83|I am like an automatic machine. I will not let people's hearts burn for me.
83|I see.
83|Hey, tiger.
83|What, cat?
83|I want to keep this clear from the start. I personally have nothing to say about what you've already done.
83|I won't accuse you of the crime of burning down the house. Because crimes like arson are humyan logic.
83|That is so. Then-
83|But...
83|I thought I told you. If you caused any harm to my myaster, I wouldn't forgive you.
83|You speak of absurd things.
83|I don't care about a girl like that, so I have no inkling of an intent to harm her.
83|Besides, the desire to burn down that apartment,
83|was an emotion that flowed in from none other than your myaster.
83|My myaster was jealous of the Senjougahara household.
83|Animation Number 105
83|So jealous she wanted it torched.
83|Animation Number 105
83|That is true.
83|Animation Number 105
83|But you know.
83|Animation Number 105
83|The emotions that wanted to suppurress that envy were also true. Tiger, you're ignoring that.
83|So annoying.
83|The result of that suppression was an aberration- myself. She's reaping what she's sown.
83|My flames do not consider such circumstances. They merely burn.
83|As if washing everything away... As if washing it away with water... I just burn it down to the ground.
83|Well, you're a more purroper aberration.
83|I'm the one not really
83|Animation Number 115
83|doing something normal
83|Animation Number 115
83|for an aberration here.
83|Animation Number 115
83|Hoshinomiya
83|2-4-101
83|My myaster's friend lives in the apartment you're trying to burn right now.
83|Given how late it is, it's purrobably not like the last two times where the buildings were luckily vacant.
83|If that girl dies, I'm sure my myaster will be crying. I have to stop that at any cost.
83|I can assure you that won't happen.
83|The girl will not cry. When she wants to, she severs that heart.
83|When she feels unease, she severs that heart.
83|That's how she's lived for the past eighteen years, creating you and me.
83|No, that is how she will live forevermore.
83|Creating a vast army of monsters, she herself stays pure white. Still beautiful and pure...
83|Hating no one. Resenting no one.
83|Kind to all. Loving all.
83|She will continue to live beautifully. Will continue to be real.
83|No.
83|And that I...
83|No, this isn't me...
83|Not me...
83|But I.
83|I, Hanekawa Tsubasa, deny it.
83|I decided to end things like this. I'm sure I will end up hating someone.
83|I won't be kind to everyone like before and won't be able to love everyone.
83|People are sure to dislike and hate me. I'll probably end up a bit angrier and unable to forgive.
83|I might become stupid. I might not be able to laugh. I might sob and cry.
83|But that's okay. That's all right.
83|I don't want to be "real." I want to be "human."
83|I don't have to be beautiful. I don't have to be white. I want to become impure with you guys.
83|Come back. It's your curfew.
83|Let's eat a meal together.
83|So annoying!
83|So hot!
83|Its impossible, cat. It is a rule that beasts fear fire.
83|Yet you try to embrace that fire. You're defying not only the laws of aberrations, but the wild too.
83|Shut up! I already know that!
83|Even if I'm really stupid, I know a cat doesn't stand a chyance against a tiger!
83|Then why do you try for the impossible? Why do what is reckless? Why do what is useless?
83|Because my myaster asked me to.
83|Not like you'd understand.
83|Animation Number 203
83|She wants to take care of everything herself.
83|Animation Number 203
83|You have no idea how happy it makes me when she needs me.
83|Animation Number 203
83|She felt no shame doing so.
83|Animation Number 203
83|She called me her little sister.
83|Animation Number 203
83|She made me her family.
83|Animation Number 203
83|She trusted me to deal with you!
83|And besides...
83|Nice to meet you. Take good care of Hanekawa-san for me.
83|So annoying.
83|Such a weak creature. Is that it?
83|Is that the limit of your so-called gratitude?
83|Fine. Since you're from the same girl, I'll be good to you.
83|I will drag you down to hell with my own hands.
83|Oh myan, I was really happy about this too.
83|I fought with my life, but I couldn't do much more than delay your arson by ten seconds.
83|This makes me hate how weak I am.
83|My last words?
83|Animation Number 239
83|No.
83|Animation Number 239
83|This is just me
83|Animation Number 239
83|being a sore loser.
83|Animation Number 239
83|That's why I told you. It's impossible. It's reckless. It's useless.
83|It was impossible. It was reckless. It was useless.
83|Come to think of it, in the end, I couldn't say it.
83|I loved him so much. I loved him so much I turned into a monster.
83|But not once could I tell Araragi-kun that I loved him.
83|It was impossible. It was reckless. It was useless.
83|That's not true, Hanekawa.
83|That samurai sword... I... I know of it. Its name, the demon sword, "Kokoro Watari."
83|It might have been impossible. It might have been reckless. But it wasn't useless at all.
83|If you hadn't risked your life and delayed this tiger by ten seconds, I wouldn't have made it in time.
83|And if so, I'd probably be crying.
83|Araragi-kun.
83|Animation Number 264
83|Araragi-kun. Araragi-kun.
83|Animation Number 264
83|Araragi-kun. Araragi-kun. Araragi-kun.
83|Animation Number 264
83|My skin burns with pain.
83|Animation Number 266
83|But all my pain is forgotten.
83|Animation Number 266
83|The burning sensation in my heart is stronger.
83|Animation Number 266
83|Oh.
83|Animation Number 268
83|Tsukihi-chan had
83|Animation Number 268
83|the right idea after all.
83|Animation Number 268
83|Just looking at him
83|Animation Number 270
83|sets me aflame.
83|Animation Number 270
83|We've only been apart a few days.
83|Animation Number 270
83|It feels like I haven't seen him in a hundred years.
83|Why are you here, Araragi-kun?
83|Come on, don't ask stupid questions. You'll hurt my feelings.
83|You were in a pinch there.
83|There's no way I wouldn't come rush to your side.
83|You're one to say that.
83|It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.
83|It's hot. It hurts.
83|It's hot. It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!
83|Um, are you Black Hanekawa? Right now?
83|Or is it Hanekawa to begin with? But you still have ears, and you have silver hair...
83|It's all me.
83|I see.
83|You're not exterminating it, right? Sorry to say this, but I took the liberty of reading that letter.
83|I stabbed a vital point with Kokoro Watari, so it won't last long. If you're going to drain it, you'd best hurry.
83|You know everything, don't you?
83|Animation Number 297
83|You know I'll disappear.
83|Animation Number 297
83|You know I'll never be the same again.
83|Animation Number 297
83|You're fully aware of what's going on when you say that, aren't you?
83|Animation Number 297
83|You're fine with it, Araragi-kun? You're fine if I'm no longer myself?
83|I'm telling you not to ask such stupid questions. You just said it yourself.
83|No matter what, it's all you. Even if you change, it's you.
83|Don't worry. I won't spoil you in a weird way there.
83|Turn rotten and I'll hate you. Do bad things and I'll scold you.
83|If someone has it in for you, I'll cover for you. If you become stupid, well, I'll help you with studying.
83|And if you cry, I'll comfort you.
83|When he did that
83|Animation Number 308
83|my heart
83|Animation Number 310
83|burned down.
83|Animation Number 312
83|It's gone way beyond hot now.
83|Animation Number 314
83|Yeah.
83|Animation Number 316
83|Being treated like this is what I always wanted.
83|Animation Number 316
83|I've wanted him to gently pat me like this.
83|I wanted him to gently pat me like this.
83|Animation Number 318
83|You know, Araragi-kun,

83|I see.
83|That makes me really happy.
83|But I'm sorry. There's a girl I'm in love with right now.
83|Of course. I know that.
83|You love her more than me?
83|Yeah.
83|Ah, I just got rejected.
83|Yeah.
83|Animation Number 334
83|I can accept this.
83|Animation Number 336
83|This is how it should be.
83|Animation Number 338
83|I confessed to him and was turned down.
83|Animation Number 340
83|I'm heartbroken.
83|Animation Number 342
83|Finally I get

83|About ten days later, a rental house to replace the burned-down Hanekawa residence was found.
83|Tamikura-sou
83|My cat ears are gone, and I don't see the History Tiger anymore,
83|but my hair is still half-silver, making me look like I have tiger stripes.
83|It feels too avant-garde to go to school with this hair, so I dye it black each morning.
83|The rented house wasn't that big.
83|Rather, it's one of the smaller houses around here.
83|You can't say it has a lot of rooms either.
83|Animation Number 368

83|So.
83|Animation Number 374
83|For the first time in my life, I gained a room of my own.
83|I didn't want the little sisters inside my heart to feel cramped.
83|It's a house I don't know at all, but it doesn't feel like I'm sneaking into someone else's house.
83|It feels more like a house I've long been used to.
83|Can you feel that way just from opening the entrance door with your own key?
83|Suddenly I remembered.
83|Animation Number 382
83|Well, look at that. If it isn't Hanekawa-san!

83|A lost cow. A fitting aberration to bump into when I lost sight of both my family and home.
83|Since the day I met Mayoi-chan at that park in May, I've been lost all this time.
83|Wandering back and forth all over the place. Wandering aimlessly.
83|But because of that, I was able to meet lots of people.
83|I saw lots of different families. I saw many sides of myself.
83|Ventilation Fan
83|That's why I was able to become me.
83|If my past self is me, then my future self is also me.
83|There's no moment when I'm not myself.
83|Then what kind of self will I be tomorrow?
83|Everyone says it every day like it's natural.
83|But to me, those words were something I never said before in my life.
83|I'm home
83|I'm home.

83|However males are really scary: they grab onto the female's body by biting a protusion,
83|This is a farewell gift
83|then after some time they finally become a part of her body!
83|What is this?
83|All the best!

84|could merely be the product of her whims and fancies.
84|Oh, and how joyous those whims are.
84|Her appearance is that of a little girl,

84|Oshino Shinobu
84|and she might be rather—or should I say surprisingly—considerate.

84|Maybe it's not consideration, but simply another one of her whims.

84|21st of August
84|Here's a summary of the events thus far.
84|I, Araragi Koyomi, along with my partner vampire,
84|Oshino Shinobu,
84|went through an oh-so-common journey back in time,
84|failed in an attempt to change history,
84|95731
84|and dejectedly returned to the present time.
84|The end.
84|Scene no. 21
84|The End
84|Scene no. 21
84|Mitsüi Logistics
84|Just so we're clear, I had a reason to go back in time.
84|A rather moving one too, even if I do say so myself.
84|That is, I did it because I knew Hachikuji Mayoi would lose her life in a traffic accident at the tender age of ten.
84|I tried to prevent that from happening.
84|Though, well, once I came back after that attempt sadly ended in defeat,
84|I asked her directly...
84|To defend my honor
84|Scene no. 26
84|(This is petty)
84|Scene no. 26
84|I wish to make this easy to follow
84|Scene no. 26
84|I don't exactly want to come back to life, you know?
84|You really did something pointless,
84|Araragi the Conceited.
84|That's what she said.
84|Anyway, I'm slowly making my way home with Hachikuji Mayoi right now.
84|By the time I traveled back in time, failed to change history,
84|and returned to the present,
84|the opening ceremony had already begun,
84|Senjougahara and
84|Scene no. 33
84|Hanekawa
84|Scene no. 33
84|might kill me twice over otherwise
84|and I had to return Hachikuji's backpack to her.
84|Sensorily it was quite a while ago
84|Scene no. 34
84|In temporal axis terms, it was only yesterday—
84|the 20th of August—
84|that the ghost girl Hachikuji came over to hang out at my place
84|and forgot her backpack there.
84|While I was desperately trying to change history,
84|Hachikuji was loitering around town so she could have her backpack returned.
84|I have to say, Hachikuji...
84|Without your backpack, you kinda...
84|stand out less as a character.
84|Light Green
84|Unnumbered Scene
84|Yeah, I do seem less like a snail and more like a slug without my backpack.
84|Snail
84|Lives above ground Part of various species having spiral shells Also called dendenmushi and maimai
84|Scene no. 44
84|That reminds me, apparently snails and slugs are practically the same thing.
84|Like, slugs are just snails that evolved to survive without their shells or something.
84|Slug
84|Though both are terrestrial mollusks, unlike snails, slugs are often considered stereotypically disgusting
84|Scene no. 44
84|A pitiless being
84|Scene no. 46
84|But it feels strange that you can take shells away from shelled animals and still be left with something.
84|In human terms,
84|I guess it'd be like, "I've lost my bones, but I'm still alive! I'm perfectly healthy," or something?
84|Something like that
84|Scene no. 50
84|Yeah.
84|Scene no. 51
84|Oh well
84|Scene no. 51
84|If you consider the shell to be the exoskeleton, sure,
84|but doesn't it fulfill the role of skin, if anything?
84|Well, people tend to associate snails with hermit crabs,
84|so it's easy to assume a snail's shell is removable.
84|Though it'd die if you actually took it off,
84|since its contents are apparently quite important.
84|Just like your backpack?
84|Shell
84|Scene no. 56
84|No.
84|My backpack doesn't contain anything that important.
84|It's just that I find it physically revolting to leave my possessions in your hands.
84|It's not really something I can't live without.
84|All it means is that Hachikuji Mayoi turns into Sluggykuji Mayoi.
84|Come on in, then.
84|Huh?
84|Scene no. 63
84|Enter your place while both your parents and sisters are away?
84|What kind of careless girl do you think I am?
84|Wait here for a bit, then.
84|I'll go get your backpack right away.
84|Ten seconds.
84|Dash.
84|Scene no. 67
84|How haughty!
84|Hey, don't go touching my things!
84|You're being unreasonable.
84|Aw, now I'll have to send it to be dry-cleaned.
84|Don't you think you've been hating on me too much for a while now?
84|I don't want that backpack anymore!
84|Throw it away.
84|But won't you turn into Sluggykuji Mayoi without this thing?
84|Why are you trying to force it on to me?
84|I bet you bugged it!
84|Black
84|Unnumbered Scene
84|Oh my god!
84|Araragi's a horrible person!
84|How little trust do I have?
84|Yellow
84|Unnumbered Scene
84|Hachikuji, is there anything you'd like to eat?
84|But I'm a ghost.
84|So if you have lunch with me,
84|you'd be just like one of those parents who still orders food for their late daughter.
84|Araragi
84|That's no big deal.
84|Oh, and while I said I'd buy you something,
84|I'm just a broke high schooler, so you'll have to be content with fast food.
84|Says you.
84|Scene no. 98
84|Get on the bike, then.
84|You take the back.
84|No way! I'd rather not sit behind you!
84|Looks like "Hate Araragi" is trending in Hachikuji's mind right now.
84|I've only entered Araragi's home at night to watch over him?
84|To begin with, what you did yesterday was practically kidnapping you know?
84|By the time the series' ended there will be more novels, like so many zombies endlessly being brought back to life.
84|There are a lot of things I'd like to eat, but none that I'd like to eat with Araragi.
84|It was right when she was about to unleash another one of those rebuttals that it happened.
84|I was waiting impatiently for one since they'd grown on me quickly,
84|"It wasn't on purpose."
84|Scene no. 105
84|but I couldn't catch all of it.
84|Araragi
84|Black
84|Unnumbered Scene

84|Because we ended up witnessing

84|Araragi
84|"it."
84|Scene no. 115
84|Even the question of whether or not it was an oddity was not one that we—or, well, I—could answer.
84|Scene no. 118
84|I couldn't identify what it was.
84|After all, I couldn't see it.
84|I don't mean to say it was transparent.
84|Because not being able to visually confirm its presence means you can't acknowledge the fact that you can't see it.
84|You don't even realize that you can't see it.
84|In other words, that means it's not there.
84|"If you can't recognize it, it doesn't exist."
84|At the very least, that's the conclusion the human mind reaches.
84|Perfect visibility
84|Scene no. 127
84|In this case, however, I could recognize that which I could not see.
84|I was able to realize that I couldn't see it...
84|Blackness, if you will.
84|Scene no. 130
84|Because there was darkness there.
84|It was intuition.
84|Scene no. 135
84|It was instinct.
84|Scene no. 135
84|It was a terrible premonition.
84|Scene no. 135
84|Araragi
84|Go!
84|I know!
84|Hachikuji!
84|Yes?
84|Check the rear.
84|Is that thing following us?
84|Er...
84|Something is!
84|Something? How close, exactly?
84|Er...
84|Well, it's like it's there before you realize it.
84|It's not close to us, but it's not far away either!
84|Coming from Hachikuji, that's a rather vague statement.
84|But it's only natural.
84|That darkness can't be seen, after all.
84|That means you can't accurately judge how far it is from you.
84|Okay, got it.
84|You don't have to check anymore.
84|Just cling to my back, Hachikuji!
84|No way!
84|Name
84|Hachikuji Mayoi
84|Don't refuse, fool.
84|We're seriously unbalanced here.
84|Tch.
84|With a smack of her lips not belike a little girl, Hachikuji Mayoi reluctantly, I presume, clung to my back.
84|Scene no. 178
84|Should I throw my backpack away, too?
84|Nah, it's okay.
84|That aside.
84|Scene no. 180
84|But we could just come back for it later.
84|It's okay, really!
84|More importantly, hold on to me tight...
84|Like you wanna merge with me!
84|Okay!
84|Press your chest against me!
84|Like this?
84|Hachikuji!
84|Wrap yourself around me!
84|O-Okay.
84|Araragi.
84|What's wrong, Twintits?
84|It's coming after us!
84|It feels like it's getting closer...
84|Shouldn't you be unable to ascertain how far it is?
84|W-Well, yeah...
84|I can't judge how far it is,
84|but I do feel its pressure or something...
84|Oddities that curse you if you so much as look at them do actually exist.
84|They're oddities that come to life once they're seen.
84|Scene no. 200
84|Basically, that darkness could be an oddity that's activated once it's seen.
84|It was an oddity.
84|Scene no. 200
84|Stop
84|Scene no. 201
84|Pretending to dispel it like a Mikoshi-Nyuudou by looking
84|Scene no. 201
84|might not work.
84|Scene no. 201
84|That's enough, Hachikuji. Stop looking at it!
84|But... But, but...
84|Just sit tight and kiss my back or something!
84|O-Okay!
84|I glanced at
84|Scene no. 219
84|the darkness.
84|Scene no. 219
84|Hachikuji, you okay?!
84|I lost an antenna!
84|Isn't that a big problem?
84|Wait, do humans even have antennae?
84|I got it wrong.
84|One of my pigtails came undone!
84|Oh...
84|That startled me.
84|Also, my blouse's sleeve got ripped a little.
84|Are you okay?
84|Yes. Only the cloth got damaged.
84|It's just that my hair's come undone and my clothes have been ripped,
84|so it kinda looks like you roughed me up and are in the midst of kidnapping me!
84|Look Left and Right
84|That's not okay at all!
84|My future's in big trouble!

84|Did I even talk about her yesterday?

84|Or will you run?
84|I'll run.
84|That isn't something that can be fought.
84|Yeah, I agree.
84|Let's run, then.
84|Pick her up, Devil Boy.
84|All right.
84|Slowly now, and try to do it as silently as you can.
84|If you make any drastic movements, it might react to them and attack us.
84|Fitting animal
84|Scene no. 313
84|Safety First
84|I think I saw you do something unnecessary there.
84|How can you say that?
84|What if there was an oddity hidden under her skirt?
84|I don't care, you idiot.
84|She was rude and upset.

84|As hard as I pedaled, I couldn't escape that darkness on a bike.
84|But Ononoki, literally burdened with the two of us,
84|pulled it off to perfection.
84|But talking about what you actually did,
84|it only looked like you jumped with all your might.
84|That's actually right, Devil Boy.
84|I tried to make it sound cool by calling it the "Escape Edition,"
84|but I simply ran away, is all.
84|"Simply," huh?
84|That said, I ran upward.
84|You made it clear that trying to escape on one plane was meaningless,
84|so I figured maybe it wouldn't be able to deal with vertical movement.
84|Looks like I was right on the money.
84|You're rather muscular, Devil Boy.
84|Nice muscles, yeah.
84|They're nice muscles.
84|You work out, huh?
84|They're nice muscles.
84|It was hard to tell when you were clothed,
84|but you've got truly nice muscles.
84|You should stay like that all the time.
84|You should show off your muscles more.
84|I think it's great how buff you are.
84|Can we talk about something else now...
84|Scene no. 362
84|Anyway, that darkness is what I want to know about now.
84|Do you really not have any idea, Ononoki?
84|Like I said, I don't know.
84|What about you? Don't you have any ideas?
84|Ideas, eh?
84|Koyomi Voice / Speech
84|Scene no. 369
84|I suppose so.
84|Scene no. 370
84|I have too many.

84|You could say my entire life consists of clues.
84|Scene no. 370
84|No clue.
84|It's not like I'm an oddity expert.
84|I'm just one of those quasi-vampire high schoolers you can find anywhere.
84|I don't think you can find those anywhere.
84|Actually, even if I look back at the oddities I've encountered thus far...
84|Vampire
84|There was a vampire,
84|a cat,
84|a crab,
84|a snail,
84|a monkey,
84|a snake,
84|a bee,
84|and a bird.
84|And a corpse too, I guess.
84|Something's off.
84|I've never seen an oddity that abstract, like it was darkness itself.
84|What the hell kind of oddity phenomenon is that?
84|White
84|Unnumbered Scene
84|Darkness, huh?
84|Well, yeah, that certainly could be darkness, but...
84|What?
84|Well, how should I put this?
84|I just hope it actually is darkness we're up against here.
84|What do you mean?
84|That was clearly darkness, wasn't it?
84|Isn't that why we couldn't see it?
84|It's much more likely that lump of black could just be a phenomenon attached to an oddity.
84|Oh, that's what you meant.
84|Though, well, if we bring that up,
84|there's no way of telling if we're even up against it.
84|We can't say for sure that it showed up with you as its target,
84|just like we can't say for sure that typhoons, storms, and other such natural phenomena are targeting humans.
84|But that thing was clearly chasing after me and Hachikuji.
84|Well, yeah...
84|Maybe my sister knows something about it,
84|Kagenui Yotsugi
84|Scene no. 394
84|Violent Exorcist
84|Scene no. 394
84|but I can't get in touch with her right now.
84|She's an old acquaintance of Oshino's
84|Scene no. 396
84|By the way, where's Kagenui right now? What's she up to?
84|She's got work too, right?
84|Yeah, but I obviously can't let you in on the details.
84|What are you probing into that for?
84|How impudent.
84|That's not really what I was going for, though.
84|I was trying to be polite
84|Scene no. 400
84|The duty of confidentiality of an Exorcist
84|Scene no. 400
84|was stronger than I anticipated.
84|Scene no. 400
84|It's not really a big deal if you can't get in touch with her.
84|We'll figure everything out once night falls, anyway.
84|How?
84|Do you suddenly become a genius at night or something?
84|Unfortunately, I don't have that sort of useful feature.
84|It's just that Shinobu will wake up then.
84|She is the king of oddities, after all.
84|She's sure to be knowledgeable about them.
84|Not to mention, she received months of special education from Oshino Meme, a specialist like Kagenui.
84|I bet she has some kind of knowledge about that darkness.
84|So once Shinobu wakes up,
84|we'll figure out what that darkness actually is.
84|Tch.
84|Red
84|Unnumbered Scene
84|That senior citizen's knowledge doesn't sound very reliable.
84|Stop calling her a senior citizen.
84|Sure, she might not know what that darkness is either.
84|But Ononoki,
84|that's fine too.
84|Why?
84|Because Shinobu devours oddities.
84|Black
84|Unnumbered Scene
84|Doesn't matter what that mysterious thing is,
84|she can just gulp it down whole.
84|I'll just have Hanekawa solve the mystery of that darkness for me later or something.
84|Hanekawa?
84|Who's that?
84|A girl who knows everything.
84|I find it rather problematic that you're so reliant on others.
84|But I do I realize I'm in no position to say that, considering I saved you and all.
84|See you later, then.
84|Later?
84|What, you're leaving?
84|More like I'm getting back to work.
84|Aren't you going to stay with me and keep me safe forever?
84|Where did that come from?
84|Just kidding.
84|You did amazingly well to keep me safe, even if you only did so once.
84|Come to think of it, I never thanked you.
84|Thanks.
84|I'll return this favor one way or another.
84|With your muscles?
84|Nah, with something not involving muscles.
84|But if you insist,
84|Scene no. 434
84|I could gouge out one of my abs
84|Scene no. 434
84|and present it to you...
84|Scene no. 434
84|As someone who could disappear from this world at any time,
84|the norm is to have favors and debts repaid at once.
84|Repaid at once?
84|Scene no. 436
84|Is there something I can do for you right now, then?
84|Something you can do right now, huh?
84|Hmm, yeah...
84|Well, there's not much I can do,
84|but feel free to ask for anything.
84|There's no harm in asking.
84|Devil Boy.
84|Look this way.
84|Smooch.
84|They were locked.
84|Scene no. 448
84|Out of nowhere.
84|Scene no. 448
84|Wh-Who do you make me out to be?!
84|I just wanted to make out.
84|Oh wow, you cheated.
84|You're a bad, bad man,
84|Devil Boy.
84|What is she even saying?!
84|Scene no. 455
84|With a completely straight face, too!
84|Scene no. 455
84|Well, I just wanted to teach you that stuff like mutual trust can crumble in an instant, like so.
84|Rather than having the favor repaid,
84|it's more like I did you yet another favor.
84|You're knee-deep in debt, Devil Boy.
84|I hope that made you feel a little better, though.
84|Directed at Shinobu

84|This is no game.
84|Then what is it?
84|Don't worry, I'll always remember your voice
84|Here's the path where I ran toward you
84|This is the sky I admired
84|Here we spend the time of our life
84|Will you laugh?
84|Will you be angry?
84|I just can't give up, and you're probably going to be angry with me
84|Countless times
84|I consider the possibility of just wanting you
84|(forevermore)
84|I still want a lie to deceive me
84|Come on, forgive me,
84|because my feelings are so chaotic
84|Yeah, I want you to know
84|that the life you found me past despair is real
84|Don't forget that
84|Scene no. 467
84|Ononoki leaving has given birth to a whole new situation, and it's hit me like a ton of bricks!
84|Hachikuji's asleep,
84|which means I can do whatever I want, right?
84|Vampire Punch!
84|Alarm
84|Press hard
84|That was a close call.
84|Looks like I woke up at just the right time.
84|The right time, eh?
84|Scene no. 496
84|Actually, haven't you only been asleep for a couple of hours, at most?
84|For some reason, I slept very lightly.
84|I couldn't get any proper sleep at all.
84|I couldn't get rid of any of my fatigue.
84|What happened?
84|I messed up
84|Scene no. 498
84|Like I've said before, you and I are mentally linked,
84|so if you get agitated, that gets transmitted to me as well.
84|Something happened to you, and that's why I couldn't sleep well. That's the only plausible conclusion.
84|Oh, yeah...
84|It's because we were being chased around by that darkness.
84|There's no doubt about it.
84|By the way, my master.
84|What?
84|Don't you have anything to say to me?
84|Let's beat around the bush
84|Scene no. 513
84|Hey, Shinobu,
84|you can adjust the length of your hair at will, right?
84|I saw you and that familiar girl kissing, by the way.
84|Um... Lady Shinobu...
84|Oh? Is an apology coming?
84|This should be good.
84|I wonder how this man's going to apologize.
84|For ignoring me, his partner in life, and indulging in such lewd acts with an outsider like that familiar girl, that is.
84|Uh, Shinobu...
84|I'm sorry!
84|Hear me out!
84|I want to know as soon as possible.
84|Scene no. 518
84|I want her to tell me.

84|"Darkness."
84|Scene no. 518
84|I refuse, you oaf.
84|Oaf
84|You always indulge in idle chatter with all sorts of women,
84|but when you have something you want to talk about,
84|you cut out the small talk and get straight to the point.
84|but also downright heretical.
84|Scene no. 523
84|Even if the heavens allow you to act that cheeky, I refuse to stand for it!
84|Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
84|Wh-Who do you think you are, Casanova?
84|Just listen to me.
84|The midsummer adventure was completely and utterly pointless. Why the hell did you waste one whole volume on that nonsense? You must be stupid. Just die.
84|Oh wait, you're half-vampire so you can't really die. What are we ever going to do with you? Geez.
84|Scene no. 549
84|Well, being detested to the bone by a young girl is a rare experience that might actually be worth celebrating, so I'm not exactly against putting up with it. That said,
84|Scene no. 549
84|Anyway, I went home with her so I could return her backpack.
84|We went happily.
84|Happily.
84|Very happily!
84|My master, why stress "happily" so much?
84|Just so we're clear, I swear on every God's name that I haven't laid a finger on Hachikuji's backpack since she forgot it at my place yesterday. I might've been called a cruel man with a lolita complex, but my moral fiber hasn't deteriorated to the extent that I put my hands on girls' private property.
84|Scene no. 549
84|I'm a gentleman. A caballero, I say.
84|Scene no. 549
84|This is a good time. I'm a vampire, so I don't need to be all that regular with my food intake.
84|However, old habits die hard, and Hachikuji's with me right now, too.
84|It might not be a bad idea to have lunch with her.
84|Scene no. 549
84|That's what happened.
84|What do you think?
84|Well, if you don't have any ideas, that's perfectly fine.
84|Damn this whippersnapper for making me listen to such a stupid story.
84|Her nuance
84|Scene no. 551
84|was a bit different.
84|Scene no. 551
84|Quite different.
84|Scene no. 551
84|Due to that, I remembered something annoying.
84|Well...
84|You know what kind of oddity that is, don't you—
84|Scene no. 553
84|As you're probably half-aware already,
84|that darkness is not an oddity.
84|It's a phenomenon without a name.
84|Bluntly.
84|Scene no. 555
84|She declared.
84|Scene no. 555
84|That thing you call the darkness...
84|I've seen it in the past.
84|Huh?
84|The past? How long ago are we talking about?
84|About four hundred years ago, I reckon.
84|Four hundred years?
84|Isn't that...
84|Yes.
84|The last time I visited this country.
84|In other words, back when I made my first servant.
84|At the time, I got caught up in that darkness.
84|No.
84|Perhaps it'd be better to say I got swallowed up by it.
84|Swallowed up?
84|If possible, I don't even want to talk about it,
84|but I suppose this isn't the time to be saying that.
84|We can't ignore it now that it's showed up, because in the worst-case scenario,
84|this entire town could be destroyed.
84|Thus it begins.

85|They were locked.
85|Animation Number 448
85|Out of nowhere.
85|Animation Number 448
85|What is she even saying?!

85|With a completely straight face, too!
85|Animation Number 455
85|Directed at Shinobu
85|Animation Number 459
85|A spiteful remark
85|Animation Number 459
85|Or is it...
85|Animation Number 459
85|The right time, eh?
85|Animation Number 496
85|I messed up
85|Animation Number 498
85|Let's beat around the bush
85|Animation Number 513
85|I want to know as soon as possible.
85|Animation Number 518
85|I want her to tell me.
85|Animation Number 518
85|"Darkness."
85|Animation Number 518
85|but also downright heretical.
85|Animation Number 523
85|The midsummer adventure was completely and utterly pointless. Why the hell did you waste one whole volume on that nonsense?
85|You must be stupid. Just die.
85|Oh wait, you're half-vampire so you can't really die.
85|What are we ever going to do with you? Geez.
85|Animation Number 549
85|Well, being detested to the bone by a young girl is a rare experience that might actually be worth celebrating, so I'm not exactly against putting up with it. That said,
85|Animation Number 549
85|Just so we're clear, I swear on every God's name that I haven't laid a finger on Hachikuji's backpack since she forgot it at my place yesterday. I might've been called a cruel man with a lolita complex, but my moral fiber hasn't deteriorated to the extent that I put my hands on girls' private property.
85|Animation Number 549
85|I'm a gentleman. A caballero, I say.
85|Animation Number 549
85|This is a good time. I'm a vampire, so I don't need to be all that regular with my food intake.
85|However, old habits die hard, and Hachikuji's with me right now, too.
85|It might not be a bad idea to have lunch with her.
85|Animation Number 549
85|Her nuance
85|Animation Number 551
85|was a bit different.
85|Animation Number 551
85|Quite different.
85|Animation Number 551
85|You know what kind of aberration that is, don't you—
85|Animation Number 553
85|Bluntly.
85|Animation Number 555
85|She declared.
85|Animation Number 555
85|Thus it begins.
85|Animation Number 564
85|Late as it may be.
85|Animation Number 564
85|The name Oshino Shinobu has become plenty comfortable to us.
85|We feel no discomfort with it. The name just fits in such a satisfactory way.
85|Her original name, Kiss-shot Acerola-Orion Heart-under-blade...
85|...is already something of the past, even for her.
85|How Shinobu is who she currently is...
85|For an iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire...
85|You could say the fact that Shinobu is who she is now is a result of her occasional whims.
85|What joyous whims they are.
85|She may look very young, but since she's lived a long life spanning over five centuries...
85|...the girl is perhaps surprisingly adept at being considerate in some ways.
85|No, she's not being considerate, but acting on more of her whims.
85|This time, we'll talk about how such whims of hers worked 400 years in the past.
85|What kind of events she faced within this country 400 years ago.
85|And what she's done.
85|It's a story of that sort.
85|As for me, Araragi Koyomi...
85|...I'll tell the tale while reminiscing about her.

85|Shinobu Time Part One
85|Font used in the video: HGP Mincho B
85|21st of August
85|Recap up to previous episode.
85|I, Araragi Koyomi, along with my vampiric partner, Oshino Shinobu...
85|...experienced a very common type of time travel together.
85|95731
85|There, we failed to change history, and we dejectedly returned to the present time.
85|The end.
85|Mitsui Logistics
85|Personally, there was an emotional reason behind that time travel as well.
85|It was to prevent the loss of Hachikuji Mayoi...
85|...who lost her life in a traffic accident at the young age of ten.
85|In the end, when I asked her directly upon our dejected return after the battle was lost...
85|I didn't want to be revived or anything.
85|You did something completely useless, Self-Satisfied Araragi-san.
85|...was what she told me.
85|And so, now I was strolling back home together with Hachikuji Mayoi.
85|After failing to change history by time traveling,
85|I had returned to the present, only to find the start-of-term ceremony was already underway.
85|And I still had to return Hachikuji's backpack to her.
85|On the timeline, it's just yesterday. August 20th.
85|Ghost girl Hachikuji came over to my room and had forgotten her backpack there.
85|While I was getting worked up about changing history...
85|...Hachikuji had been wandering all over town in an attempt to retrieve her backpack from my house.
85|But Hachikuji...
85|You know, without a backpack, something about your character...
85|...feels very faint.
85|It's true that without my backpack, I look more like a slug than a snail.
85|Come to think of it, I heard that slugs and snails are the same thing.
85|Something about a slug is a snail that's regressed from having a shell...
85|It feels weird that a shellfish would lose its shell by regression, yet have something left.
85|If it were a human, wouldn't it be something like "I lost all my bones, but I'm still alive and well!"?
85|If you think of a shell as an exoskeleton, then yeah.
85|But in terms of what it does, isn't it more like skin?
85|I don't know. The impression of a hermit crab is pretty strong...
85|...so it feels like you can take shells off of snails.
85|Of course, if you actually did, they'd die.
85|Apparently, some important stuff is in those shells.
85|Just like your backpack?
85|No, nothing inside my backpack is that important.
85|It's just physiologically impossible to accept the current situation...
85|...that my belongings are in your hands, Araragi-san.
85|I'm not especially troubled without it.
85|Hachikuji Mayoi will simply become Mayoi the Slug.
85|Then, come in for a bit, Hachikuji.
85|Huh?
85|I have not lost my precautions as a girl...
85|...to the point that I'd enter your house when neither your parents nor sisters are present, Araragi-san.
85|Then, wait here for just a minute. I'll go grab your backpack immediately.
85|10 seconds. Dash.
85|Arrogant!
85|Hey, don't touch that, please! That's my stuff!
85|Don't ask for the impossible...
85|Ah, now I have to get it cleaned.
85|Hey, don't you think you've been disparaging me a little too much?
85|I don't want that backpack anymore. Please dispose of it.
85|No, if you don't have this, you're going to turn into Mayoi the Slug, right?
85|Why are you suspiciously trying to shove this back on me?
85|You must have wiretapped it or something.
85|Sheesh, you really are the worst, Araragi-san!
85|I'm being doubted too much here...
85|Hachikuji, do you have anything you want to eat?
85|Yes, but as you can tell, I'm a ghost.
85|So if you were to spend lunchtime with me...
85|...people would look at you like those parents that order enough food for themselves and their late daughter.
85|Araragi
85|I don't care about that.
85|Well, even though I said I'm treating, I'm a student facing entrance exams, so it'll be fast food.
85|All right, hop on the bike. Let's ride double.
85|No, I don't want to be behind you, Araragi-san!
85|And so, just now, I was expecting another one of these...
85|..."I hate Araragi-san" responses that Mayoi seems to be infatuated with.
85|It had already become addicting to me, and I was waiting for the exact moment it would come.
85|But I couldn't hear it out to the end...
85|Araragi
85|Because we...
85|Araragi
85|...witnessed "it."
85|I couldn't pinpoint what "it" was.
85|Because I couldn't see "it" at all.
85|The fact that I couldn't see "it" doesn't mean that "it" was transparent.
85|However, if you can't visually recognize something,
85|it means you can't "admit" the "perception" that "you can't see."
85|You can't realize that you can't see. In other words, it doesn't exist.
85|Something you can't perceive cannot exist.
85|At least within the human brain, such logic stands.
85|And, in this case, I was able to perceive this invisible "thing."
85|The fact that I could perceive what I couldn't see...
85|...was because the "darkness" was right there.
85|Please take us out of here!
85|I know!
85|Hachikuji!
85|Yes!
85|Check behind us! Is that thing following us?
85|Let's see...
85|Something is chasing us!
85|Something? What's it like?
85|Well, it's like it's there before you know it.
85|It's like it's not close to us, but it's also not that far away.
85|For someone like Hachikuji, that's a very vague way to express it.
85|But that is totally understandable. Because that "darkness" is invisible.
85|The fact that it's invisible means that you can't accurately gauge its distance.
85|All right, got it! You don't have to look anymore!
85|Hachikuji! Cling onto my back!
85|Name
85|Hachikuji Mayoi
85|I refuse!
85|Don't refuse, idiot! The balance is off like this!
85|Should I throw off my backpack as well?
85|No...
85|...you don't have to!
85|But I can get it later!
85|It's all right!
85|More importantly, Hachikuji, hold on tighter to me! As if you were going to fuse into me!
85|Okay!
85|Push those breasts into me more!
85|Like this?
85|Hachikuji! With more rotation!
85|S-Sure!
85|Araragi-san!
85|What's wrong, twin boobs?
85|It's following us!
85|And it looks like it's getting closer...
85|I thought you couldn't tell?
85|W-Well, I can't. I don't have a sense of distance.
85|But I guess I'm feeling oppressed...
85|Aberrations that curse people just by looking at them do exist.
85|An aberration that's created on sight.
85|In other words, there's a chance that the "darkness" is an aberration that needs to be witnessed to take effect.
85|Hachikuji, that's enough! Don't look!
85|But! But, but...
85|Just stay quiet and kiss my back!
85|O-Okay!
85|Hachikuji! Are you all right?
85|I broke an antenna!
85|Isn't that a big deal?
85|Or rather, do humans have organs that are antennae?
85|My mistake! One of my two ponytails came loose!
85|I see...
85|Don't surprise me.
85|And my blouse ripped a tiny bit around my shoulder.
85|Are you all right?
85|Yes, it was just my clothes...
85|But since my hair is half down and my clothes are torn...
85|Look Left and Right
85|...I look like I was assaulted and about to be kidnapped by you, Araragi-san!
85|That's not all right!
85|My life from here on is in trouble.
85|Name
85|Hachikuji Mayoi
85|Unlimited Rulebook.
85|Devil boy...
85|Over here.
85|Safety First
85|Huh? Oh, it's you, Ononoki-chan. Why are you here?
85|Safety First
85|What are you talking about? We just met yesterday.
85|Walk Slowly on Construction Site
85|T-Thank...
85|Safety First
85|It's a bit early to say your thanks...
85|Safety First
85|Devil boy, what is that?
85|What, Ononoki-chan? Wasn't your role to suddenly appear, save me...
85|...and then explain everything to me?
85|That's troubling if you expect all that convenience from me...
85|Safety First
85|Walk Slowly on Construction Site
85|Where's Hachikuji?
85|My, my. I helped you on a whim here...
85|...but if I'd known it'd be like this, I would've left you alone.
85|It looks like I got myself involved in something I don't exactly comprehend.
85|Talk about hard luck.
85|Don't tell me you should've left us alone. Life is a very precious thing.
85|Walk Slowly on Construction Site
85|Funny how an undead vampire says that.
85|Is that girl the ghost you were talking about yesterday?
85|She's got a backpack on her back. So you were able to safely return it to her. I'm glad.
85|Yesterday?
85|Was that yesterday? It's seems so long ago that I don't remember.
85|Devil boy.
85|How do we go about this?
85|Safety First
85|Against that.
85|Fight it? Or run from it?
85|Run from it.
85|Fight it? That thing implies nothing of the sort.
85|Right. I think so too.
85|Then, we're escaping. Devil boy, hold on to that girl.
85|Got it.
85|Quietly. Make as little noise as possible.
85|And slowly. If you move too abruptly, that thing might react to your movement and attack us.
85|Safety First
85|I think you had some extraneous movement there.
85|What are you talking about? What if there's an aberration hiding up her skirt?
85|Like I know, idiot.
85|Then...
85|Unlimited Rulebook, secession version.
85|Radius
85|Forbidden
85|Entry Prohibited
85|We apologize for any inconvenience and ask for your cooperation.
85|Danger Zone Ahead
85|Entry
85|Prohibited
85|Danger from Above
85|I couldn't escape from the "darkness" no matter how hard I pedaled.
85|Ononoki-chan, while literally holding on to two good-for-nothings, managed an admirable escape.
85|What you actually did looked like...
85|...nothing more than just jumping with all your strength from both feet.
85|No, you got it right, devil boy.
85|I made it sound fancy by saying secession version, but I just simply escaped.
85|Simply?
85|But in a three-dimensional way.
85|You had proven to me that it's meaningless to try to escape two-dimensionally.
85|So I thought maybe it wouldn't have countermeasures for vertical movement.
85|That was the bullseye.
85|Devil boy, you have quite a bit of muscle.
85|Good muscles. Yup.
85|Good muscles. You must work out. Good muscles.
85|I didn't notice while they were covered by clothes, but they are good muscles indeed.
85|I think you should stay like that forever.
85|You should appeal your muscles more to the world.
85|You have an amazing thin-yet-macho body.
85|But for now, what I want to know about is that "darkness."
85|Ononoki-chan, you really have no clue?
85|I told you, I don't know!
85|Alternatively, don't you have any idea yourself, devil boy?
85|A clue, huh...
85|No idea.
85|It's not like I'm a specialist in aberrations either.
85|I'm nothing more than a commonplace quasi-vampire that goes to high school.
85|I don't think that's commonplace...
85|Or rather, even thinking back on all the aberrations I've had to deal with...
85|Vampire, cat, crab, snail, monkey, snake, bee, bird...
85|...and a corpse.
85|It feels different.
85|I've never seen an aberration so vague. Like it was "darkness" itself.
85|What kind of an aberration-induced phenomenon is that?
85|"Darkness," huh...
85|Well, that "thing" probably is the "darkness," but..
85|What is it?
85|Well, how to put it...
85|It would be nice if what we're dealing with really is just the "darkness."
85|What do you mean? No matter how you look at it, it was "darkness."
85|That's why we can't see it, right?
85|The possibility that the black blob was...
85|...merely a phenomenon affixed to an ordinary aberration is a lot higher.
85|Oh, that's what you mean...
85|Well, if we get into that, I'm not sure if we even "dealt with it" at all.
85|It's not necessarily the case that it showed up to go after you.
85|Just like how phenomenons such as storms and typhoons don't target a particular human.
85|No, but that thing was clearly chasing after me and Hachikuji.
85|I know, but...
85|Big Sister might know something about this...
85|...but I can't contact her right now.
85|By the way, where and what is Kagenui-san doing right now?
85|She's probably at work, right?
85|Work is work, yeah, but the details are of course a secret.
85|Trying to probe stuff out of me? Such impudence.
85|I wasn't trying to be impudent by asking...
85|Well, even if we can't contact Kagenui-san, there's no problem.
85|I'll figure everything out come evening anyway.
85|Why? Do you suddenly turn into a genius come evening, devil boy?
85|I don't have such a convenient function.
85|Simply put, Shinobu will wake up.
85|Shinobu is the lord of aberrations after all. I think she's familiar with all sorts of them.
85|On top of that, she got special lectures for several months...
85|...from Oshino Meme, a specialist just like Kagenui-san.
85|I'm sure that she has some knowledge about that "darkness" too.
85|So if Shinobu wakes up, I'll know exactly what that "darkness" is.
85|Heh...
85|I don't trust the knowledge of such a senile geezer...
85|Stop calling Shinobu a senile geezer.
85|It's true Shinobu might not even know what that "darkness" really is...
85|But Ononoki-chan, that's fine in its own way.
85|Why?
85|Shinobu eats aberrations.
85|Whatever that mysterious thing turns out to be, she'll swallow it whole.
85|And I'll ask Hanekawa to explain the mystery of the "darkness" sometime later.
85|Hanekawa? Who's that?
85|Someone who knows everything.
85|I think there's something wrong about being completely reliant on someone else like that.
85|Though it's weird for me to say this now, because I just happened to rescue you, devil boy.
85|Well, see you.
85|See you? What, you're already going home?
85|I'm not going home. I'm going back to work.
85|Weren't you going to be at my side forever and protect me from harm?
85|What kind of thought is that?
85|A joke. You did a great job protecting me, even if it was once.
85|Come to think, I had forgotten to say my thanks. Thank you.
85|I'll repay you in some way.
85|With muscles?
85|No, with something other than muscles...
85|For someone like me, who doesn't know when she'll be gone from this world,
85|gratitude and favors are basically repaid at once.
85|Repaid at once...
85|Then is there something I can do right now?
85|Something you can do right now?
85|Hmm, let's see.
85|Though what I can do is very limited, you can try asking for anything.
85|Whatever it is, it doesn't hurt to ask.
85|Devil boy...
85|Look this way... smooch.
85|W-What the ellemenopee...
85|Quearessteeu.
85|Oh no, you cheated!
85|You're such a bad guy, devil boy.
85|Well, I just wanted to teach you that trust and stuff like that all crumble away so easily.
85|I think that was me adding to the gratitude you need to reciprocate instead of you doing so now.
85|You have quite a bit now to repay, devil boy.
85|But well, that was a bit of a relief.
85|See you.
85|Well, do your best and survive... In this game that you don't know the rules of...
85|This isn't a game.
85|Then what is it?
85|Ima mo zutto, sono koe wo oboeteru kara
85|I will always remember your voice, forever.
85|Ano hi hashitta michi ni ano hi miageta sora ni
85|I ran to you on this path. We admired the sky here.
85|Nidoto kaera nai toki wo kasaneteru
85|And here, we spent the time of our lives.
85|Kimi wa warau darou ka sukoshi okoru darou ne
85|Are you going to laugh, or are you going to be angy?
85|Konna akirame warui boku no koto wo
85|You'll probably be angry, but I just can't give up.
85|Nando demo
85|Time and time again,
85|Ukatsu ni negau kanousei wo seisa shite
85|I simply just want you.
85|itsumade mo
85|forever and ever
85|Mada amai uso ni damasarete takute
85|I want to be deceived by a lie.
85|Dakara douka, semete nante omou kokoro wa
85|My feeling are so chaotic,
85|Ichiji teki na kanshou datte yuruseba ii
85|so please forgive me.
85|Dakara sou sa, kimi ga yatto zetsubou no saki de
85|I want you to know that in the past,
85|Fureta hibi ni itsuwari nante nai to
85|the despair you found in me
85|Itte ageyou
85|was real.
85|Wasurenai de
85|Don't forget that.
85|The condition that was born from Ononoki-chan leaving the premises...
85|Shudders!
85|Since Hachikuji's asleep, I can do whatever I like to her right now...
85|Vampire punch!
85|Alarm
85|Press hard
85|Sigh, I guess that was a close call.
85|I guess I woke up with good timing.
85|Haven't you only gotten like two hours of actual sleep?
85|My sleep was rather light. I couldn't get any decent rest in.
85|I couldn't get rid of any fatigue at all.
85|What happened?
85|I told you already. We're paired up mentally now.
85|If you're unsettled, that gets passed on to me.
85|All I could think of is that something happened to you, and therefore my sleep became lighter.
85|Oh, that's...
85|That "darkness." It's because it chased me. No doubt about it.
85|By the way, you...
85|Eh? What is it?
85|Don't you have something you have to tell me?
85|Hey Shinobu, you can change the length of your hair at will, right?
85|If you're talking about how you kissed that little shikigami girl, I totally saw it.
85|Um, Shinobu-san...
85|Oh, an apology? An apology?
85|I'm looking forward to this. How is this man going to apologize?
85|About how he shoved me, his lifelong partner, aside...
85|...and performed acts with some outsider, a little shikigami girl.
85|Hey, Shinobu...
85|I'm sorry, but listen!
85|Hmph! I refuse, you fool.
85|Oaf
85|You chitchat with all sorts of girls on a regular basis.
85|Yet you always dispense with the small talk when you have something you want to talk about.
85|Such a convenience for you may be forgiven by the heavens, but not by me!
85|W-What are you doing to me!
85|Are you an Italian?
85|Just listen to my story.
85|So we headed back together to my place so that I could return the backpack to her.
85|In a friendly, friendly, very friendly manner.
85|Why are you stressing "friendly" so much?
85|...and that's how the story goes. How about it?
85|It's fine if you have no clue.
85|You told me such a stupid story, you brat.
85|Thanks to that, I'm reminded of something unpleasant.
85|No...
85|As you are already half-aware...
85|...that "darkness" is not an aberration.
85|That phenomenon has no name.
85|That thing you call the "darkness" is something I have seen in the past.
85|What? How long ago are you talking about?
85|About 400 years ago.
85|400 years? If I recall, that was...
85|Right.
85|It was the previous time that I visited this country.
85|In other words, back when I made my first minion.
85|Back then, I was entangled in that "darkness."
85|No, I guess I should say that I was swallowed up by it.
85|Swallowed up...
85|I'd rather not speak of it, but in this situation, I can't really keep it that way.
85|Now that "it" has surfaced, the worst case scenario is if I leave it be,
85|this entire town will fall to ruin.

85|As you wish, I'll kill some time talking about it.
85|Sounds interesting!
85|Yay!
85|There are 53 cards in a card game, however...
85|However?
85|What sort of a number is that? To begin with, having 13 ranks for each suit is silly; it just feels so incomplete!
85|Excited
85|Let's put our heart into it.
85|Truth is I'm happy to do it.
85|Incomplete indeed!
85|So let's go with 10 ranks for each suit, and we don't need the joker: 40 cards total.
85|I believe it will make card games simpler.
85|Simpler, but so much blander.
85|Talking
85|Let's begin then!
85|Eh?! How long will it take?
85|Maybe 50 cards would be even better? Then it can't be helped; let's add a "Moon" suit to the set.
85|Please, at least make it a "Fire" suit!

86|Demon Story
86|Opening
86|Chapter 02
86|Chapter 03
86|Scene no. 1
86|Before we delve into the story, let me say something in warning.
86|What I'll talk about now is the first time I made someone my servant,
86|but don't be jealous.
86|Now, where should I begin?
86|Let's just cover everything, I guess.
86|All the events leading up to my visit to this country, to Japan.
86|That period was the peak of my golden age, the pinnacle of my vitality.
86|Before coming to Japan, I was at the South Pole.
86|I wanted to see the auroras.
86|Looking back on it now, it was a disaster.
86|The problem wasn't how cold it was, but rather the complete absence of human beings.
86|Oddity tales can't come to life without eyewitness accounts or stories from personal experience.
86|Demonstrating immortality and superhuman capabilities to penguins and polar bears won't get them talking about it.
86|I wasn't exactly freezing to death, but for some reason...
86|I felt like I was slowly disappearing as an entity.
86|I thought I was in grave danger at the time.
86|Hurriedly I left the South Pole.
86|I left with a liver-entering super jump.
86|Hmm?
86|What about the familiar girl's jump?
86|You can't even compare us.
86|My own jump very nearly destroyed Antarctica with the recoil.
86|I didn't really think things through, so it was looking quite likely that I'd fall into the ocean.
86|I didn't really mind, though. Swimming a little would be refreshing.
86|But to my considerable surprise, I landed in this country.
86|I fell into a lake.
86|The impact flat out annihilated the lake.
86|Here is where the story begins.
86|The pointless story of a demon.
86|Episode Heart-Under-Blade
86|Shinobu Time Part Two
86|Font used in the video: HGP Mincho B
86|Scene no. 3
86|Well then, my master.
86|What do you think happened when I jumped from Antarctica into a lake?
86|Yup, the water was thrown high into the sky.
86|Hardly any water was left in the lake itself.
86|What do you think happened to the water then?
86|For a time, it was floating in the atmosphere before obeying gravity again and falling back to the ground, as rain.
86|Meanwhile, the drought in the areas nearby was so grave that the ground was cracking.
86|By coincidence, I gave them rain.
86|Without intending to, I had not only saved many people, but all life in a large radius.
86|In an unlikely chain of events, I had been watched.
86|Oddly enough, I was seen performing what must have seemed like a miracle.
86|Incidentally, my master,
86|what do humans call those whom they deem to have performed miracles?
86|Do you know?
86|They call those who perform miracles "gods."
86|Though they might be an oddity or a human strictly speaking, whoever performs a miracle is deemed to be a god.
86|Scene no. 5
86|Their lake was the object of their worship.
86|The people in the vicinity were venerating it as a divine lake, and they prayed to it.
86|Usually they were praying for rain.
86|Looking at it from their perspective, I emerged from the lake with a large shockwave.
86|They must have thought I was the personification of its water.
86|You certainly must have seemed divine to the people with your tall stature, blonde hair, and yellow eyes.
86|They made Shinobu into a god
86|Scene no. 6
86|However
86|Scene no. 6
86|However...
86|Scene no. 6
86|Surely that didn't last, though.
86|Why?
86|Consider your personality.
86|You're not really the type to be content with being revered and then just calling it a day.
86|Fickle
86|Scene no. 9
86|A vampire fixated on being a demon.
86|Scene no. 9
86|You're right.
86|My life as a god did not last very long—
86|probably about a year, at best.
86|My personality aside,
86|it must've been plain as day that I wasn't cut out to be a god.
86|Nearby, Hachikuji Mayoi was still unconscious.
86|Scene no. 14
86|The reason I happily accepted the veneration of those bumpkins was because of the calm it promised.
86|I mean, I was their god.
86|I never lacked food or comfort.
86|It felt like I was on a vacation.
86|To be precise, a place was built for me to sleep.
86|At the bottom of the former lake, that is.
86|It was a shrine of sorts.
86|A most spectacular building, I have to say.
86|What, you think I was a cruel god for enlisting some poor villagers to construct me a shrine?
86|I built it myself.
86|Have you already forgotten my ability to transmute materials?
86|I was at the peak of my power then, too.
86|Constructing a building and the various other things within it was as easy as pie.
86|Speaking of which, my master.
86|Seeing you in nothing but your underwear is hard on the eyes.
86|I'll make you some clothes. Wear them.
86|That looks good.
86|Looks good on you.
86|I did my job as their god, by the way.
86|It wasn't enough to let it rain once for them.
86|Every once in a while I gave them their rain.
86|I was herding rain clouds.
86|I'll admit, it was a pleasant time.
86|It wasn't so much about killing time as it was about enjoying its uneventfulness.
86|I kept thinking that being seen by them would eventually let me have confidence in myself as an entity again,
86|but I was unable to kill two birds with one stone.
86|I suppose the reason is that they never saw me as a vampire, as an oddity.
86|Hence the feeling of having a tenuous hold on reality never really abated.
86|It took me a while to realize this.
86|Of course, not being seen as a vampire was quite all right with me.
86|It wasn't a pressing issue.
86|The problem was with being seen as a god.
86|Gaze into an abyss, and the abyss gazes back at you.
86|Therefore, being called a god means that you'll become one.
86|I didn't realize that... Nay, I was foolish enough to be completely ignorant of the fact.
86|Now that I look back on it, I should've left those lands once I learned that they had no vampire legends,
86|and I shouldn't have accepted their worship.
86|I suppose the way it ended was punishment for continuing that charade and acting like a god.
86|At least that's what he said.
86|He.
86|Yes, my first servant.
86|The wielder of Heart Span, the demon sword.
86|He was fighting.
86|He was fighting in a time of peace, perhaps more peaceful than the modern age.
86|Fighting with what?
86|If I say that he was not fighting other humans, then his potential opponents are awfully limited.
86|Yes, he was fighting oddities.
86|Scene no. 16
86|Fighting oddities?
86|So basically, he was a specialist?
86|No.
86|Scene no. 18
86|"Fighting" feels wrong.
86|Scene no. 18
86|Rather—
86|Scene no. 18
86|Koyomi / Conclusion
86|Scene no. 18
86|Vampire hunter?
86|I suppose so.
86|I have the feeling that he mentioned being part of some ancient lineage of supernatural hunters,
86|but now I'm not really so sure.
86|By the way, aren't you going to tell me his name?
86|It'd be easier to create a mental image of him.
86|Don't know it.
86|My memory of human proper nouns is vague, and I don't call anybody by their name.
86|Isn't that too cold-hearted?
86|Scene no. 21
86|Where did that go?
86|Scene no. 21
86|He was just the "oddity slayer" to me.
86|Much like what I'm referred to now.
86|He was easy to tell apart from the other humans by his sword,
86|and he had a special air about him too.
86|Oh well, let's just call him the "first oddity slayer" then.
86|The first oddity slayer
86|Scene no. 22
86|The first servant
86|Scene no. 22
86|If he hunted down the supernatural, does that not also mean that he came for you too?
86|He must've heard the rumors and came looking for you.
86|Nay.
86|No, no.
86|We did fight once, but he didn't come to hunt me down.
86|Just think about it.
86|The rumors he would have heard told of my veneration as a god.
86|That's not a being he would have hunted.
86|Scene no. 25
86|He came to check on things.
86|With this proud and ancient lineage, he could not ignore tales of a lake disappearing and being incarnated as a god.
86|Come to think of it, he showed up there in a palanquin.
86|All his attendants were following, one after another.
86|It looked like the procession of a feudal lord.
86|The man who emerged from the palanquin carried two matching swords which fascinated me.
86|The longsword was the demon sword, Heart Span.
86|The one you've used replicas of.
86|The second demon sword, the shortsword, was Dream Span.
86|Scene no. 27
86|What's the shortsword like?
86|If Heart Span kills oddities, does Dream Span kill humans?
86|Wait, that'd just make it an ordinary sword.
86|It revives oddities.
86|Oddity Slayer
86|Scene no. 29
86|The shortsword Dream Span brings oddities back to life.
86|Oddity Restorer
86|Scene no. 29
86|The two are intrinsically linked
86|Scene no. 29
86|Well, since oddities aren't alive in the first place, that might not be the best choice of words,
86|but the long and short of it is that it allows their restoration.
86|Periodically, they came to check on me, we talked, and then they went home.
86|It happened numerous times.
86|I also helped them hunt oddities fairly often.
86|That was when I began to feel he was a reliable man.
86|Shouldn't you have just turned into a god, then?
86|Listening to this, it seems like you're perfect for the role.
86|You weren't oppressing your people, though I guess in a time of crisis your vampiric impulses might've resurfaced.
86|You blockhead.
86|Shinobu Voice / Speech
86|Scene no. 31
86|Isn't that a big problem in and of itself?
86|How obstinate.
86|Scene no. 32
86|At any rate, that wasn't the only problem.
86|Scene no. 34
86|The problem was my very existence, my very being as an oddity and vampire.
86|My very existence as the vampire called Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade attracts oddities.
86|Likewise, underlying the attraction of oddities is an attraction of negative energy.
86|Bad elements.
86|Yes, I had grown careless.
86|I'm not supposed to remain in one place for such a long time, you see.
86|All it does it upset the balance of its oddity ecosystem.
86|I grew careless because I had come from the South Pole, where there are neither human beings nor oddities.
86|I never realized that those bad elements weren't gathering there at all.
86|It was the locals who noticed it first.
86|They heard stories about people disappearing,
86|They heard stories about people disappearing.
86|Scene no. 35
86|of people leaving their homes and never coming back.
86|Vanishing.
86|Scene no. 35
86|I talked with the first oddity slayer about it and we conducted a search together,
86|but due to a lack of evidence to the contrary, we chalked it up to ordinary crime.
86|It wasn't a job for us, but one for the police.
86|It was no job for a god and a hunter of the supernatural,
86|Scene no. 35
86|we decided.
86|Scene no. 35
86|In the end, I did nothing.
86|Even as I languished, the villagers kept disappearing.
86|And eventually, none were left.
86|Scene no. 36
86|What do you mean, exactly?
86|It sounds like all the villagers vanished without a trace.
86|That's correct.
86|The village was completely deserted.
86|By far.
86|Scene no. 37
86|After that, I began visiting the surrounding villages.
86|I learned through my investigation that none of the villages in the vicinity had any inhabitants either.
86|As though someone had drawn a border, all the villages past a certain point were completely unaffected, though.
86|Border?
86|Border
86|Scene no. 137
86|Partition
86|Scene no. 137
86|You mean the border between your worshippers and everyone else?
86|I believe so.
86|More accurately, I believe it only affected those who knew of me.
86|Worship played no part.
86|She visited them.
86|Scene no. 40
86|Finally it hit me.
86|Regardless of my extended sojourn, there was hardly any negative energy to be felt.
86|I felt like I had probably stayed for too long,
86|and in the meantime the energy had started making trouble out of sight somewhere,
86|but when I looked around, I saw nothing of the sort.
86|It was exceedingly strange that there was nothing to be found.
86|It was entirely out of the ordinary.
86|That there was no negative energy in the vicinity was much more eerie to me than the mass disappearances.
86|It was so eerie that I went home and slept.
86|Hey...
86|A good sleep is the best cure for an addled mind.
86|I suppose!
86|Having soundly slept and completely forgotten everything, I tried to go back to sleep, but was rudely disturbed.
86|(Omitted)
86|Scene no. 45
86|Rudely disturbed? By an enemy?
86|Enemy
86|Scene no. 144
86|Darkness
86|Scene no. 144
86|No, by the first oddity slayer.
86|Scene no. 47
86|There was new information regarding the first oddity slayer's subordinates.
86|They had disappeared.
86|Somewhere, somehow.
86|Basically, the first oddity slayer found himself alone after he turned away for a moment.
86|Once I heard about this, I grimly indicated that we needed to investigate the issue.
86|Unlike me, their sense of danger
86|Scene no. 48
86|was perfectly in order—
86|Scene no. 48
86|Additionally,
86|Scene no. 48
86|their sense of fear.
86|Scene no. 48
86|I had already visited the surrounding villages and learned what there was to learn,
86|but still went through them all again with the first oddity slayer.
86|Naturally, nothing had changed.
86|The people that had seemingly disappeared into thin air had not materialized.
86|Scene no. 49
86|Suddenly, our luck ran out.
86|Suddenly—Without warning.
86|Scene no. 50
86|It appeared.
86|Scene no. 50
86|When we confirmed that the last house in the last village we visited was empty,
86|the first oddity slayer became very depressed.
86|The matter had hurt him quite deeply.
86|That was when we saw it.
86|The darkness you spoke of.
86|In violation of all common sense, it appeared in broad daylight.
86|Finally it showed itself.
86|Scene no. 52
86|The real problem.
86|Scene no. 52
86|Scene no. 53
86|At first, I thought it was a weather anomaly.
86|Describing it as a black mass seems the most appropriate,
86|but "black mass" suggests that it had mass, and I don't think it did.
86|It ate us.
86|It ate us both.
86|Belatedly I realized that this was the cause of all the disappearances.
86|Three quarters of my body were swallowed by the darkness.
86|Well, retaining one quarter was enough.
86|To escape, that is.
86|I jumped to the South Pole.
86|I didn't run away. I didn't run away.
86|Scene no. 54
86|I've never
86|Scene no. 54
86|run away from anything—
86|Scene no. 54
86|It was the first time I had been so gravely damaged, such was my power.
86|I just wanted to get away.
86|I jumped excessively far, though.
86|The darkness did not pursue me,
86|wait as I might.
86|That was how I departed Japan.
86|I stayed away.
86|The next time I returned was half a year ago.
86|When I met you.
86|Hang on.
86|What happened to the first oddity slayer?
86|I told you.
86|He was swallowed by the darkness with me.
86|I got away with a quarter, but it got him first and he wasn't so lucky.
86|It got almost his entire body.
86|That doesn't make sense, Shinobu.
86|If he got swallowed by the darkness there, then this would be where the story ends.
86|Alas, it does not.
86|Try listening to me.
86|Yellow
86|Unnumbered Scene
86|I told you almost his entire body was swallowed.
86|You did.
86|That's why I'm voicing these doubts.
86|Almost.
86|Something was left.
86|His right hand.
86|His hand?
86|I told you he was swallowed first, right?
86|As he was being swallowed, he held onto my wrist like he was seeking help.
86|Like this.
86|He held on tight.
86|I jumped to the South Pole with his hand attached.
86|Scene no. 68
86|I was left behind at the South Pole, with only his hand left.
86|I was alone, left behind.
86|For a hundred years I lingered, lost in thought.
86|I felt completely isolated.
86|Of course, the encounter with the mysterious darkness deeply affected me.
86|I felt threatened, not to mention endangered and uneasy.
86|That's why I resurrected him.
86|I made my first servant.
86|Ever heard of the suspension bridge effect?
86|High on a fragile suspension bridge, you can confuse the adrenaline from fear and the adrenaline from love.
86|Basically, be it on a suspension bridge or elsewhere,
86|If you explain it like that,
86|Scene no. 69
86|it's rather easy to understand,
86|Scene no. 69
86|living beings tend to fall in love and to try to reproduce when they feel their life is in danger.
86|but that effect
86|Scene no. 69
86|is open to interpretation.
86|Scene no. 69
86|Love, family, kin...
86|It has nothing to do with one's feelings.
86|It's a basic impulse.
86|This is where
86|Scene no. 69
86|There is nothing amazing about it.
86|disappointment kicks in.
86|Scene no. 69
86|You've simply gotten weak.
86|Eagerly I bit into his right hand and drank his blood.
86|Not as food, but to make a servant.
86|I didn't want to be alone, so I stopped being a god and returned to being a vampire.
86|Don't worry, I'll always remember your voice
86|Here's the path where I ran toward you
86|This is the sky I admired
86|Here we spend the time of our life
86|Will you laugh?
86|Will you be angry?
86|I just can't give up, and you're probably going to be angry with me
86|Countless times
86|I try to reign my feelings in
86|(forevermore)
86|I still want a lie to deceive me
86|Come on, forgive me,
86|because my feelings are so chaotic
86|Yeah, I want you to know
86|that the life you found me past despair is real
86|Don't forget that
86|Scene no. 70
86|So, were you successful?
86|I was not.
86|You weren't?
86|The first oddity slayer came back to life, as I had planned.
86|Perhaps he just wasn't as strong as you.
86|I suppose I should have been more caring.
86|I think you said he ran out into sunlight and turned to ash, right?
86|Yes, he committed suicide.
86|Black
86|Unnumbered Scene
86|Unavoidable.
86|Scene no. 74
86|It was unavoidable.
86|Scene no. 74
86|His suicide.
86|Scene no. 74
86|Roughly ninety percent of all vampires die like that.
86|It was a pedestrian way to die.
86|Regenerating in the flames.
86|Scene no. 75
86|Until everything is burned to ash.
86|Scene no. 75
86|You didn't save him then?
86|You saved me when I wandered out into the sun during spring break.
86|Don't expect the unreasonable.
86|At that time I didn't understand the meaning of his actions.
86|Besides, we had confused discussions until he committed suicide,
86|so at that point our relationship had already thoroughly broken down.
86|I had no inclination to save him.
86|Broken down?
86|Just missing the mark
86|Scene no. 77
86|He was furious.
86|He was furious I had turned him into a vampire.
86|Not a god, a demon.
86|Scene no. 78
86|He learned she was a vampire.
86|Scene no. 78
86|The first thing he said after I had resurrected him from nothing but his hand and given him a new life was,
86|"How dare you dupe us, you monster!"
86|He screamed that everything was my fault.
86|It was more accusation than anything.
86|That was also when he mentioned divine punishment.
86|Basically he blamed the disappearances and everything else on you?
86|He thought the darkness was your doing too?
86|What did you do?
86|Whatever the reason, you did save him in a way.
86|There's no way you could have still been calm after what he said.
86|It wasn't that bad.
86|Resolving the misunderstanding would have been frustrating, so I just ignored him.
86|I figured he was just a bit confused and would eventually calm down.
86|That can't be true.
86|Scene no. 84
86|If she were that kind of woman,
86|Scene no. 84
86|then I wouldn't be here now.
86|Scene no. 84
86|I wouldn't be alive as a half-vampire.
86|Scene no. 84
86|He never calmed down.
86|After antagonizing me time and time again, he jumped out into the sunlight.
86|Slinging complaints and grudges, all his resentments at me, he died in the sunlight right before my eyes.
86|I couldn't stop him.
86|I couldn't rescue him.
86|I told him my real name there at the South Pole, but he only called me "Kiss-shot" once right before his death.
86|But he still called you Kiss-shot?
86|He didn't call you Heart-under-blade.
86|He didn't call you Acerola-orion.
86|He called you Kiss-shot.
86|Just like I do.
86|Then he was dead.
86|In light of his immortal body it would be more accurate to say he was destroyed, but dead is dead.
86|As a memento, he left me with a replica of Heart Span that he made from his own flesh and bones.
86|I bet he made it to slay me one day.
86|Before that I never really actively opposed making servants, and didn't actively seek solitude.
86|Having seen his body go up in blue flames and burn to ash,
86|I resolved to never again make any servants and to drink blood only for nourishment.
86|God as my witness.
86|I couldn't laugh at her tale, at least.
86|More elegantly said, I could not admire her exploits.
86|In the end, she could get along with human beings as neither a vampire nor a god.
86|The story of a demon,
86|a story four hundred years in the past,
86|concludes here with a bad ending.

87|I wouldn't be alive as a half-vampire.
87|Animation Number 84
87|Before I start the story, here's a little preface. Though it's more like a warning.
87|You should know that I'm going to talk about when I created my first minion.
87|Don't get jealous.
87|Now, where should I begin?
87|Right. First, the circumstances...
87|The circumstances with which I visited this country, Japan.
87|I was in top form and at my prime then. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
87|Before I came here, I was in Antarctica. I wanted to see auroras and such.
87|But the trip was a failure.
87|No, it's not that I'm not good with the cold. The problem was there were no people in Antarctica.
87|Stories of aberrations don't stand without talk of seeing or experiencing them.
87|Penguins and polar bears aren't going to talk about me,
87|even if they witness my immortality and my monstrous nature.
87|I wasn't going to freeze to death, but somehow, I felt my existence beginning to weaken.
87|"This is bad!" "It's a huge crisis!" is what I thought.
87|I hurriedly escaped from Antarctica with a huge joystick-pushing jump.
87|That tsukumo-gami girl's jump? Hmph, something like that pales in comparison.
87|Frankly, the recoil from my jump almost destroyed the continent of Antarctica.
87|I jumped randomly, so I thought I'd fall into the ocean,
87|and I was thinking I'd take a swim to freshen up.
87|But there, to my surprise, was this country.
87|I fell into a lake. How I obliterated that lake by doing so starts the story.
87|The story of a good-for-nothing demon.

87|Shinobu Time Part Two
87|Font used in the video: HGP Mincho B
87|So, do you know what landing in a lake after a huge leap from Antarctica does?
87|Right. "The water splashes up." Almost all the water in the lake did. And what does that splashed-up water do?
87|After momentarily flying high in the air, it follows gravity and falls to the ground as "rain."
87|Back then, the drought around the lake was so bad that the ground was cracking.
87|I just happened to "make it rain" there.
87|As a result, I saved many lives...
87|Or rather, I saved all the communities in the vast region around the lake.
87|Further, I had terrible timing, since someone witnessed the act that saved them.
87|Of all things, someone saw the moment that created that "miracle."
87|By the way, do you know what humans call someone who creates a "miracle"?
87|Right. Those who create miracles are called "gods."
87|To be precise, those who create miracles, whether aberration or human, are turned into "gods."
87|Apparently that lake was the object of some sort of worship.
87|The area's residents called it "God's Lake," revered it, and prayed to it. In other words, they prayed for rain.
87|Well, to them, it looked like I burst into existence from within the lake.
87|As if the lake's waters incarnated and appeared as me.
87|To Japanese people then, if a tall, golden-eyed blonde like you showed up,
87|she'd look like a deity in some way.
87|But I don't think that would last long.
87|Why's that?
87|Well, judging from your personality.
87|You're not the type that's all right with merely being revered.
87|Just like you said, such a life as a god didn't last for long.
87|I think it was about a year.
87|Besides my personality, I probably...
87|...wasn't fit to be a god.
87|Hachikuji Mayoi, at our side, still hasn't regained consciousness.
87|Well, after being set up by the people as a god,
87|staying there meant a break for me, so I was in good spirits.
87|I mean, treated as a god?
87|It was easy to find a place to sleep and food to eat.
87|It felt like a small vacation.
87|My bed, to be precise, was created.
87|At the bottom of the lake that was now gone.
87|I built what you'd call a shrine. A very gorgeous building.
87|Hmm? What a terrible god I am for forcing a village under such duress to build a shrine?
87|I built it myself. Did you forget my ability to create physical materials?
87|This was me in my prime.
87|I could easily make buildings and the gadgets that came along with them.
87|Or rather, you sitting there in just your underwear is becoming an eyesore.
87|I'll make you some clothes, so wear them.
87|Hmm, looking pretty good. It suits you, it suits you.
87|I was doing proper work as a "god" too.
87|It wasn't like rain was something I only had to make fall once.
87|At random intervals, I made it rain for them.
87|I gathered rain clouds from around the region.
87|If you call it comfortable, it was comfortable.
87|A way to kill time, or rather, to be satisfied with free time.
87|I had thought that my power of existence would revive as long as they kept "witnessing" me.
87|But unfortunately, life isn't quite that easy.
87|Because they weren't "witnessing" me as an aberration, as a "vampire,"
87|there was no way my powers would revive. It took me a while to realize that.
87|If I couldn't be "witnessed" as a vampire, that was fine as well.
87|That in and of itself wasn't an imminent problem.
87|The problem was that I was continuing to be "witnessed" as a "god."
87|If you play with the devil, you become the devil.
87|And in that case, if someone calls you a god, you become a god.
87|I really was careless for not realizing that... No, worse yet, for not even knowing that at all.
87|Now that I think about it, what I should've done...
87|...was to reject the treatment as a god and depart once I realized the region had no vampire legends.
87|You can simply say that I got what was coming to me because I was pretending to be a god.
87|At least, that's what he said.
87|He... That's right. My first minion.
87|In other words, the owner of the demon sword "Heartspan."
87|That man had been fighting...
87|He fought even in those peaceful days. The days that in a way were more peaceful than the present.
87|Against what, you ask?
87|If you're not fighting humans, there are only certain things you can fight against.
87|Right! He fought aberrations.
87|Fight aberrations...
87|Huh? So in other words, he's one of those specialists?
87|Vampire hunter.
87|Well, I guess that would be right.
87|The descendant of a long-standing clan that made a living by defeating monsters...
87|...I think was what he said. Or maybe he didn't...
87|Around now would be a good time to disclose the name of this first minion, wouldn't it?
87|Otherwise, I can't really imagine his face.
87|I don't know.
87|I only vaguely remember proper names of the human world.
87|And I never call anyone by their name.
87|I had always called him "Aberration Killer."
87|Just like I am called now.
87|He carried a sword, so it was easy to differentiate him from the others.
87|He also had that aura only specialists have.
87|Well then, out of convenience, we'll call him the "original Aberration Killer."
87|A specialist in defeating monsters...
87|So, of course, I assume he came to defeat you?
87|After hearing rumors of you from somewhere, he showed up to defeat you.
87|No. Not like that, no...
87|I did end up in a battle once, but he didn't arrive in order to defeat me.
87|I mean, think about it.
87|In every rumor that he heard from somewhere, I was revered as a god.
87|I was not a target to be defeated.
87|He had merely come by to check things out.
87|A lake had disappeared and manifested itself as a god.
87|A "man of a long-standing clan" couldn't dismiss rumors of something like that.
87|Come to think, he arrived in one of those palanquins.
87|He had rows of henchmen behind him. It was almost like a stately procession.
87|I was drawn to the two katana, one large and one small, wielded by the man who stepped out.
87|The long katana was the demon sword "Heartspan". You've used a replica of it.
87|The other demon sword, the shorter katana, was named "Dreamspan".
87|What kind of blade was the shorter katana?
87|If "Heartspan" was a blade to kill aberrations, was the shorter one a blade to kill humans?
87|No, that would make it a normal katana.
87|It was the "Aberration Reviver."
87|The small katana "Dreamspan" takes aberrations and brings them back to life.
87|It's strange to say you're bringing a lifeless aberration back to life, but...
87|In other words, it's a katana that restores aberrations.
87|I see.
87|After that, they came to check up on me every so often. They'd chat with me a while, then go home.
87|Such visits repeated.
87|I also helped them defeat monsters several times too.
87|That was when they had my back.
87|Hey, Shinobu...
87|Why didn't you just turn into their god for good?
87|It sounds like you were well-suited. Like you were a perfect match for them.
87|You weren't oppressing your people or anything.
87|If there were any issue, would it have been your impulse to suck blood?
87|You idiot.
87|The impulse to suck blood is problematic enough!
87|Or rather, that wasn't the only problem.
87|The aberration known as me... The problem was my existence as a vampire.
87|The existence of Kiss-shot Acerola-Orion Heart-under-blade as an aberration gathers aberrations.
87|However, what gathers aren't exactly aberrations, but negative energy that has yet to become aberrations.
87|It's "bad stuff" of that sort.
87|And right. I was being careless.
87|I shouldn't stay in one location for an extended period of time.
87|I completely destroy the balanced ecosystem of aberrations.
87|And, what made me careless back then...
87|...was how I had previously been in Antarctica, where no humans or aberrations existed.
87|I didn't realize at all that absolutely no "bad stuff" was gathered there.
87|The people of the region were the first to notice the problem.
87|It went like this.
87|They heard stories about people disappearing.
87|They say — people don't come home after heading out.
87|I talked it out with the original Aberration Killer as well, and we investigated.
87|We couldn't find any evidence, so we concluded that it was probably a crime committed by a human.
87|This was not a job for us,
87|it was a job for the police.
87|In summary, I didn't do anything.
87|And still, they disappeared. The people of the region continued to go missing.
87|And that continued until there were none.
87|What do you mean "until there were none"?
87|To me, you made it sound like every person in the area had disappeared.
87|That's correct. The entire settlement became deserted.
87|After that, I looked in every village in the area.
87|I see.
87|And, as a result of my search, I found out...
87|...that there was nobody left in any of the settlements in the area.
87|As if someone drew boundaries. Every village past a certain point was safe.
87|Boundaries.
87|Those boundaries... In other words, "whether or not they worshiped you" had become a boundary?
87|Right. If you want to be more precise, it was "whether or not they knew me."
87|Worship had no connection.
87|And well, I finally came to the realization...
87|That negative energy had not piled up in the area at all,
87|even though I had resided there for quite some time.
87|So I thought, if there were any reason for that, it was...
87|...those energies caused something to happen because I stayed there too long.
87|After looking around the area, I could find no evidence of it.
87|But it was still weird.
87|Strange. Something was abnormal. It was an abnormal situation.
87|Honestly, the fact that nothing had built up...
87|...was more mysterious than how all the inhabitants in the area had disappeared, and it grossed me out.
87|It grossed me out, so I went home and napped.
87|Come on!
87|What? It's best to sleep things off when you're not feeling well, right?
87|That's true, but still!
87|So, to forget about it all, I tried to go back to sleep again.
87|However, someone showed up to disturb me from my slumber.
87|Showed up...
87|...is that the enemy?
87|Nope. The one who showed up...
87|...was the original Aberration Killer.
87|The new information was about the original Aberration Killer's henchmen.
87|They also disappeared. Gone. To somewhere unknown.
87|And, before he knew it, the original Aberration Killer was left all alone.
87|So, I, of course, heard his story out...
87|...and with a grimace on my face, said, "Then we must investigate this."
87|I had already done my rounds of the villages once and knew of their current state.
87|But I ended up going around the villages again with the original Aberration Killer.
87|Of course, there were no changes.
87|Those that were "spirited away" hadn't suddenly returned home.
87|Without warning, something evil happened.
87|In the last village we visited, we found out the very last house we looked in was deserted.
87|The original Aberration Killer was severely depressed.
87|Right there, while he was delicately heartbroken...
87|That was when it showed up.
87|The thing that you call the "darkness"...
87|Completely disjointed, in the middle of the day...
87|To be honest, I initially thought it was some strange weather pattern.
87|I think it is most fitting to describe it as a black cluster...
87|...but it didn't seem like it was solid enough to be called a cluster.
87|It swallowed us. It swallowed both of us.
87|I realized, though a bit too late, that this was what had caused the spiriting away.
87|It had swallowed about three quarters of my entire body.
87|But, well, if I had a quarter of me left, it was enough.
87|At least to escape...
87|I, you know, flew down to Antarctica.
87|Even I have never have had my body shaved off in such a way before...
87|...so I just wanted to distance myself from it.
87|But apparently I didn't have to go that far.
87|That "darkness" never came chasing after me, no matter how long I waited.
87|Well, under those circumstances, I left Japan.
87|And I never went back.
87|The next time I set foot in Japan was 6 months ago.
87|And that is when I met you.
87|Wait. What happened to the original Aberration Killer?
87|Hmm? I already told you.
87|He got swallowed by the "darkness" with me.
87|I was spared at three quarters,
87|but he was swallowed first, so three quarters didn't cut it for him.
87|Almost his entire body was gone.
87|That's strange, Shinobu.
87|If you're saying that the "darkness" swallowed him up, then the story ends there.
87|No, no, you got it wrong. Listen closely.
87|I think I said that almost his entire body was swallowed up by the "darkness."
87|You did. That's why I'm voicing my doubts.
87|If so...
87|Almost.
87|In other words, there was a part of him left.
87|His right hand and wrist.
87|Hmm?
87|Wrist?
87|I told you he got swallowed up before I did.
87|And when he did, he grabbed my wrist as if he was seeking help.
87|Grasped it firmly, like this.
87|I had jumped down to Antarctica along with his hand and wrist.
87|In the end, I was left behind in Antarctica with his hand and wrist.
87|Left behind.
87|I was all alone.
87|It was the first time in a hundred years I had felt that way.
87|I was seized by an incredible sense of isolation.
87|I'm sure it didn't help that it happened right after encountering
87|an unidentifiable phenomenon like the "darkness".
87|I didn't feel danger or uneasiness, but I did feel threatened.
87|That is why...
87|...I revived him.
87|I made my first minion.
87|There's that misattribution of arousal...
87|Something like a rapid heartbeat from fear of heights...
87|...being mistaken for a rapid heartbeat from being in love.
87|In summary, whether atop a tall bridge,
87|or in any situation where you feel your life is in danger,
87|organisms tend to fall in love more in an effort to leave progeny.
87|Love and romance... Families and minions...
87|It's nothing emotional like that.
87|More impulsive and unable to be restrained. That's my reason.
87|My heart was weakened.
87|With a chomp, I bit into his right wrist,
87|and I sucked its blood.
87|Not as a meal, but to create a minion,
87|I sucked its blood.
87|Because I didn't want to be alone, I stopped being a god and returned to being a vampire.
87|Ima mo zutto, sono koe wo oboeteru kara
87|I will always remember your voice, forever.
87|Ano hi hashitta michi ni ano hi miageta sora ni
87|I ran to you on this path. We admired the sky here.
87|Nidoto kaera nai toki wo kasaneteru
87|And here, we spent the time of our lives.
87|Kimi wa warau darou ka sukoshi okoru darou ne
87|Are you going to laugh, or are you going to be angy?
87|Konna akirame warui boku no koto wo
87|You'll probably be angry, but I just can't give up.
87|Nando demo
87|Time and time again,

87|I simply just want you.
87|itsumade mo

87|I want to be deceived by a lie.
87|Dakara douka, semete nante omou kokoro wa
87|My feeling are so chaotic,
87|Ichiji teki na kanshou datte yuruseba ii
87|so please forgive me.
87|Dakara sou sa, kimi ga yatto zetsubou no saki de
87|I want you to know that in the past,
87|Fureta hibi ni itsuwari nante nai to
87|the despair you found in me
87|Itte ageyou
87|was real.
87|Wasurenai de
87|Don't forget that.
87|So, did you succeed?
87|I failed.
87|F-Failed?
87|Just as I expected, the original Aberration Killer came back to life.
87|However, I guess he wasn't as mentally strong as you are.
87|In hindsight, I guess I just wasn't considerate enough.
87|If I recall, he jumped into sunlight of his own will, turned to ash, and was no more?
87|Right.
87|Suicide...
87|A very, very common reason for vampires to die. Roughly 90 percent die that way.
87|You didn't save him?
87|Just like you did during spring break when I went into the sun.
87|That would be impossible.
87|Back then, I didn't quite understand the meaning behind such actions by him.
87|Or rather, I had many conversations with him until he decided to commit suicide...
87|...but by then, my relationship with him had completely broken down.
87|There was no way to stop him.
87|Broken down?
87|To make it easy to understand, he was angry.
87|The original Aberration Killer was angry that I had turned him into a vampire.
87|After reviving him from just one hand and wrist...
87|...and after he gained a new life as a vampire, the first thing he said to me was...
87|"You monster! How dare you scheme against us!"
87|He yelled at me.
87|"So everything was your doing!"
87|Though he wasn't merely yelling, but placing blame.
87|That's when he began talking about "receiving divine punishment" and such too.
87|In other words, he thought everything, including the "spiriting away," was your fault.
87|That even the "darkness" was something you had set up...
87|So, what did you do?
87|No matter the motive, you somehow managed to save him.
87|Yet after hearing that, you must have been unsettled.
87|No, not really. It wasn't that bad.
87|Well, I found it a chore to undo the misunderstanding, so I let him say whatever he wanted to.
87|I thought he was confused and deranged, but he would calm down in due time.
87|However, he never calmed down.
87|Confused, deranged, and after many confrontations with me...
87|...he tossed his body in an act of suicide.
87|Saying all sorts of begrudging words to me...
87|...words of regret and resentment...
87|...he threw himself into the sunlight in front of my eyes and died.
87|I couldn't stop him, and I couldn't save him.
87|I had told him my real name while we were in Antarctica.
87|But in the end, he called me "Kiss-shot" only once.
87|Right before he committed suicide.
87|Even then, he called her Kiss-shot.
87|Not Heart-under-blade. Not Acerola-orion.
87|Kiss-shot. Just like me.
87|If so...
87|And so he died.
87|Because of the body's immortality, it is more precise to say that he ceased to exist than that he died.
87|But in any case, he died.
87|He left behind a replica of the demon sword "Heartspan" that he created from his flesh and bones.
87|I'm sure he created it with the intent of killing me.
87|Until then, for whatever reason, I had not made any minions.
87|It wasn't that I was persevering in my solitude out of stubbornness...
87|...but after seeing the blue blaze disappear, how his corpse vanished...
87|...I swore that I would never make a minion again.
87|I would never drink human blood for any purpose other than for nutrition.
87|I swore to god.
87|At the least, I couldn't laugh about that.
87|Nor admire her for her wit.
87|Because in the end, in spite of everything,
87|she couldn't hit it off with humans as a "god" or a "vampire."
87|The demon's soliloquy.
87|The story of 400 years ago.
87|With this bad ending, the curtain falls.

87|Preview Quiz!
87|Quiz!
87|Did you read "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"?
87|Awesome! Show us how it's done!
87|I read it, I perused it, I devoured all of it!
87|A journey with a company of three: the lion, the scarecrow and the tin robot.
87|Indeed, the Big Three eh?
87|The robot and scarecrow characters are overlapping though...
87|Excited
87|It's up to you now...
87|Eh! I'm the one to do it?!
87|Both are human-shaped!
87|While the scarecrow will never become a robot, isn't the opposite entirely possible?
87|The scarecrow has no reason to exist, be it on the road, or in a field.
87|Plus one longs for a heart, and the other a brain, how similar is that.
87|Both share too many similarities.
87|The same can be said about Toto and the lion though.

88|So all said and done, we still don't know anything about that darkness?
88|I suppose we don't.
88|To be perfectly honest, I had no way of dealing with it even in my heyday.
88|But there's no time to be moping about, is there?
88|What should we do now?

88|You shouldn't listen to everything that senior citizens tell you to do.

88|I still owe you for buying me that ice cream.
88|I can't just sit back and watch as you let a foolish oddity get you into big trouble,
88|so consider this a warning.
88|Lots of talking involved.
88|Scene no. 51
88|I overheard everything,
88|by chance.
88|I'm surprised you still have the courage to look me in the eye and call me a senior citizen,
88|artifact girl.
88|Though I bet you're trembling on the inside.
88|Well, I'll reward you for your bravery by not swallowing you up right now.
88|Really?
88|I think it'd be hard for you to pull it off in your current state.

88|You even lied to me and said you had work to do.
88|That wasn't a lie. I do have work to do.
88|I merely postponed it a little.
88|Well, knowing how narrow-minded that senior citizen is,
88|I figured she'd be reluctant to speak with me around.
88|Oh, how you wound me.

88|What is this place, a utopia?
88|My master,
88|do you realize you're thinking out loud?
88|Whoops.
88|That was a close call.
88|Barely safe.
88|No, what you said was barely legal.
88|Who could've imagined these three coming together?
88|What an amazing bonus stage!
88|Hey, the Devil Boy's smirking for some reason.
88|That's the kind of man he is.
88|Be careful.
88|He'll cling to you for the rest of life just because you kissed him once.
88|Oh, my
88|I wager they're making me out to be the bad guy now.

88|By the way, let's take this chance to make it perfectly clear.
88|Who do you like best out of the three of us?
88|Huh?
88|Holy smokes!

88|Yeah, we'd better get that straight.
88|This is a disaster.
88|Scene no. 119
88|E-Er...
88|Out of the three of you, it'd obviously have to be my partner, who I'm one in body and soul with...

88|By the way, Hachikuji,

88|Come on.

88|but you and I don't need to be that distant.
88|No, I wasn't thanking you for that hug earlier.
88|I said I was grateful because you didn't abandon me during your great escape.
88|The situation was such that I was sure you'd throw me off and run away by yourself.
88|Black
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|Yay, I have zero trust!
88|Also, it made me happy that I didn't ignore the traffic signals.
88|You were thinking of me, right?
88|Hachikuji...
88|Though I don't really mind if you were.
88|I'm not that sensitive.
88|You disappoint me!
88|No.
88|Scene no. 204
88|And we received divine punishment.
88|Scene no. 204
88|Come on, everyone!
88|Now that I've come to, let's get this show on the road!
88|Listen up, Shinobu, Ononoki.
88|I respect your individuality,
88|but please, try to cooperate this time.
88|Today, our teamwork gets put to the test!
88|Y-Yes, ma'am!
88|Okay.
88|For some reason, Hachikuji took charge,

88|Well then, Codename Gold.
88|Brief us on the situation at hand.
88|Yes!
88|Hey, wait!
88|You'd do well to knock it off already.
88|Or else...
88|Thus ends Hachikuji's short-lived reign.

88|If you want something of me, then just kiss me to get my attention, you shy little girl.

88|What do you mean?
88|The one about ideas.
88|You asked me if I hit upon something by listening to the senior citizen's story.

88|Scene no. 220
88|Ononoki.
88|I'm sorry, but could you seriously stop calling her that?
88|That term's being phased out by society nowadays, anyway.
88|What should I call her, then?
88|Devil Girl, maybe?
88|Shinobu = 8 years old.

88|Ugh.
88|Fine, I guess I'll do as you say.
88|Is her existence as an artifact spirit prompting that frustration?
88|Scene no. 227
88|Anyway, let me give you the conclusion I reached after conveniently overhearing the Oddity Slayer's story.
88|Sure. Did you come up with something?
88|Mysteries invite more mysteries
88|Scene no. 229
88|and only despair grows
88|Scene no. 229
88|That's how it is
88|Scene no. 229
88|That's no oddity.
88|It's something else.
88|That's exactly why both this Oddity Slayer
88|and the first Oddity Slayer couldn't deal with it.
88|It's only natural, considering it operates under a different set of rules.
88|Of course, you won't be able to deal with it either.
88|If it's not an oddity, then what is it?
88|What would that make that darkness?
88|Like darkness itself.
88|Scene no. 235
88|It's a mystery.
88|Scene no. 235
88|I don't know the specific term.
88|However, I do know someone who would know.
88|And who would that be?
88|Gaen Izuko.

88|Scene no. 243

88|Scene no. 243

88|Scene no. 247
88|were afraid.
88|Scene no. 248

88|Scene no. 248
88|Run away, everyone!
88|Yeah!
88|Run away?
88|Scene no. 250
88|But how?
88|Scene no. 250
88|How can we escape?
88|Scene no. 251
88|Right?
88|Scene no. 251
88|Hachikuji!
88|Void
88|Get over here!
88|Hachikuji has to make it, even if nobody else does.
88|Scene no. 256
88|So I hope the darkness
88|Scene no. 256
88|comes in my direction.
88|Scene no. 256
88|Okay!
88|She must survive.
88|Scene no. 260
88|Now, Ononoki!
88|Huh?
88|That's too bold of you, Devil Boy.
88|Cut it out.
88|Where do you think you're touching me?
88|What are you thinking at a time like this?
88|What the hell are you thinking?!
88|Let's run away, Ononoki!

88|In the blink of an eye——
88|Scene no. 283
88|Didn't that darkness come after us?
88|Looks like it.
88|Actually, it seems like it's definitely not perceptive to vertical movement.
88|That's how the Oddity Slayer escaped four hundred years ago,
88|so it was a good thing we did the same this time.
88|I am thrilled I did not fall.
88|Scene no. 287
88|Wait, where's Hachikuji?
88|She wasn't thrown off, was she?
88|Don't worry.
88|You held on to her chest with everything you had.
88|She's asleep by the tree over there.
88|Scene no. 292
88|She sure has an attitude when there's no danger.
88|Scene no. 292
88|Relax.
88|Scene no. 292
88|What time is it?
88|Wait, how long was I passed out?
88|How long, you ask?
88|Long enough to let Hachikuji and me mess with you as we pleased.
88|What did you do to me when I was out?!
88|Lilac
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|Did she just call her Hachikuji?
88|When did those two get friendly?
88|To be specific, you were out for a night.
88|Around twelve hours from dusk up until now, I guess.
88|Twelve hours...
88|I sure slept a long time.
88|Scene no. 299
88|If I can be wary for a second,
88|let me say that it not being perceptive of vertical movement
88|is simply a conclusion drawn from empirical evidence.
88|It's just a temporary thing.
88|We can't be certain that it'll work next time.
88|Yeah.
88|Empirical evidence aside, I simply don't understand the laws it operates under.
88|What the heck is that?
88|I'd prefer it chased us, then.
88|Scene no. 300

88|Scene no. 306
88|Okay, then.
88|What now?
88|We don't even know where we are.
88|No reception, unsurprisingly——
88|Scene no. 309
88|I'd like for us to counterattack.
88|Can we?
88|Before that, it's unclear whether that thing is really targeting us or not.
88|If we jumped to the conclusion that it was after Shinobu, that would be based on empirical evidence as well.
88|Standard procedure says we'll have to start with making inquiries.
88|Inquiries?
88|Information gathering.
88|Did you forget what I was talking about right before it showed up?
88|I said there was someone who knew about that non-oddity phenomenon, didn't I?
88|Gaen Izuko
88|Scene no. 238
88|Gaen.
88|Gaen Izuko.
88|Should I ask her?
88|She's a friend of Kagenui's, right?
88|In which case, we'd have to approach Kagenui first to get us access to her.
88|Ononoki, don't you have work to do?
88|Of course I do.
88|But I can't just go back to work now after coming this far.
88|Even I'm not that heartless.
88|Can you get in touch with Kagenui?
88|I do have several ways in which to contact her as a last resort.
88|None of them will work up here in the mountains, though.
88|Can't you communicate telepathically or something?
88|Unfortunately, we aren't that strongly linked.
88|We'll have to climb down the mountain and call or text her from there.
88|if the shit hits the fan,
88|Scene no. 322
88|she will abandon me without a second thought.
88|Scene no. 322
88|Black
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|Actually, Devil Boy,
88|could you drag the Oddity Slayer out from your shadow already?
88|I don't know if she doesn't want to talk to me,
88|or if she's just sleeping peacefully,
88|but she hasn't showed up once since we landed here.
88|That reminds me that she isn't here— no, I was aware that she wasn't around the entire time. That's why I assumed she was in my shadow— unlike Ononoki or Hachikuji, Shinobu and I can never be truly apart.
88|Scene no. 326
88|Through my shadow.
88|Scene no. 326
88|Through my heart—
88|Scene no. 326
88|We are connected.
88|Scene no. 326
88|Shinobu hasn't?
88|We can never be apart— essentially, this immediately means that she is currently holing up in my shadow.
88|Scene no. 327
88|——However.
88|Scene no. 327
88|However,
88|Scene no. 327
88|that is strange upon reflection.
88|Scene no. 327
88|But it's nighttime.
88|Dawn is near, and it's not midnight anymore, but this still clearly counts as night——
88|Scene no. 328
88|There are no hints of impending dawn.
88|Scene no. 328
88|So why?
88|Why isn't Shinobu awake?
88|Why?
88|Devil Boy, how could you ask me that?
88|Strong discomfort
88|Scene no. 331
88|It's obviously because she hates me.
88|Sure, she may not like you,
88|but that's not reason enough for her to literally hide in the shadows at such an important time.
88|That's not what she's like.
88|You seem to trust her a lot.
88|What's this all about, then?
88|I thought it was out of the question at first,
88|but maybe she's lying unconscious in your shadow,
88|or she's been gravely injured some way or the other.
88|Is it even possible to get gravely injured inside a shadow?
88|That domain is like Shinobu's hyperspace of sorts.
88|Physical impact should be irrelevant there.
88|My shadow in the moonlight is faint, but a shadow is a shadow——
88|Scene no. 344
88|She should be here.
88|Scene no. 344
88|It's strange that she isn't——
88|Scene no. 344
88|Ononoki, now I have no choice but to kiss you.
88|How did you even reach that conclusion?
88|We'll have to use the excitement derived from that act to call out to Shinobu like we did yesterday.
88|It's gotta be a kiss.
88|A wet, sloppy one!
88|There is no other way
88|Scene no. 351
88|We have to kiss, whether we like it or not
88|Scene no. 351
88|No options!
88|Scene no. 351
88|Well, if you insist...
88|I kinda don't like it, though.
88|I don't want to.
88|Scene no. 353
88|Um, Araragi.
88|What's this, Hachikuji? Jealous?
88|I don't mind kissing you either.
88|I wish you'd told me earlier, though.
88|Die, Araragi.
88|Oops!
88|I meant wait, Araragi!
88|Why must I have to wait to kiss Ononoki?
88|Well, there are countless reasons why,
88|but before that, let's talk about Shinobu.
88|So she's not in your shadow right now, is she?

88|It's not like she's not...
88|Maybe she's sleeping
88|Scene no. 372
88|Maybe she's unconscious...
88|Scene no. 372
88|Excuse me, Devil Boy.
88|Ononoki?
88|Quiet.
88|I'm looking into it now—
88|investigating it now.
88|I just waited.
88|Scene no. 379
88|For something like an answer.
88|Scene no. 379
88|She's gone.
88|At last
88|Scene no. 381
88|she said
88|Scene no. 381
88|with a plain voice
88|Scene no. 381
88|She's gone.
88|Scene no. 383
88|I saw it back then.
88|Void
88|The darkness mixed in with your shadow.
88|Maybe Shinobu was swallowed up at that moment.
88|Maybe, just maybe, though.
88|Red
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|Shinobu got swallowed up by that darkness?
88|No way.
88|Nah, I don't think that's true.
88|Void
88|If the Oddity Slayer actually did get swallowed up,
88|the Devil Boy would've completely lost his vampire nature.
88|He would've gone back to being a normal human being.
88|He hasn't, though.
88|That isn't true...
88|Scene no. 401
88|But wait.
88|Can you tell whether I'm still a vampire or not,
88|As a familiar.
88|Scene no. 402
88|As an oddity.
88|Scene no. 402
88|Ononoki?
88|No, but there's a simple method even you could use to tell.
88|I mean, you can still see Hachikuji, right?
88|Yeah.
88|If you can clearly see Hachikuji, an oddity,
88|then that means you're still a vampire.
88|I see her.
88|Black
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|I can see her.
88|Black
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|She's certainly there.
88|Black
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|That she
88|Scene no. 412

88|Scene no. 412
88|is indisputable.
88|Scene no. 412
88|I see.
88|The Oddity Slayer hasn't perished.
88|Void
88|But we should consider the link between the two of you disconnected.
88|The link has been disconnected?
88|The link may have been severed, to be more precise.
88|By that darkness mixing with your shadow, that is.

88|Black
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|What does that mean?
88|Black
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|Void
88|It means Shinobu can no longer be restrained in my shadow, right?
88|In which case...
88|It'd mean we hung the Oddity Slayer out to dry back there.
88|You're kidding me.
88|Are you saying I left Shinobu behind with that mysterious darkness?
88|Calm down, Araragi.
88|No time to get discouraged.
88|Scene no. 431
88|Stop beating yourself up over it.
88|Remember what Ononoki just said?
88|If you can see me, then that means Shinobu is still alive and well.
88|I want to apologize to her.
88|Scene no. 432
88|I want to apologize.
88|Scene no. 432
88|This is not the worst-case scenario.
88|Though I don't know
88|Scene no. 433
88|whether it will cheer me up.
88|Scene no. 433
88|I still want to apologize.
88|Scene no. 433
88|Yeah, you're right.
88|I want to see her.
88|Scene no. 434
88|I won't forgive it.
88|Scene no. 435
88|How dare it do that to Shinobu——
88|Scene no. 435
88|Let's get off this mountain.
88|We need to regroup with Shinobu quickly!
88|I understand how you feel, Devil Boy,
88|but don't rush things.
88|Damn it
88|Scene no. 438
88|I can't think straight
88|Scene no. 438
88|My actions are random and hasty
88|Scene no. 438
88|I agree with getting off the mountain,
88|but before regrouping with the Oddity Slayer, we should contact my sister.
88|Oh, right.

88|The optimal sequence
88|Scene no. 440
88|We need it
88|Scene no. 440
88|Either way, we're leaving this place using your Unlimited Rulebook's Escape Edition, right?
88|Yellow
88|Unnumbered Scene
88|No.
88|That's wrong, Devil Boy.
88|Unfortunately, we can't use the Unlimited Rulebook's Escape Edition anymore.
88|Huh? Why?
88|You're not currently linked with the Oddity Slayer.
88|At least for now, that means you're not immortal.
88|That's why you couldn't handle our earlier escape.
88|You're weakened, Devil Boy.
88|This isn't limited to the Unlimited Rulebook's Escape Edition.
88|Whatever ridiculous things you've done in the past couple of months,
88|you should consider yourself no longer able to pull them off.
88|Scene no. 458
88|Ononoki said I was weakened,
88|but that's not exactly right.
88|I'm not actually weakened.
88|I'm just gradually returning to normal.
88|I'm still a vampire, but not as much of one as I was before.
88|I'm still immortal, but not as much as I was before.
88|The breeze won't push me over.
88|Scene no. 460
88|Probably.
88|Scene no. 460
88|The situation is gradually deteriorating.
88|Scene no. 460
88|But wait, does this mean Shinobu's regained some of her vampire powers?
88|Due to this disconnection, I mean. Relatively speaking.
88|No, I'm sure she's going through the same thing you are.
88|Like a domino effect.
88|That's how your relationship works.
88|Yes.
88|Scene no. 465
88|That's what the idea was.
88|Scene no. 466
88|It's not just me, basically.
88|Shinobu'll keep getting worse too.
88|But calm down.
88|It's not all over yet.

88|What should I send her?
88|The password,
88|and the code which says we'll wait for her to contact us.
88|While I was at it,
88|I sent Senjougahara, Hanekawa, Karen, and Tsukihi texts informing them I was safe and sound.
88|I don't want to make them worry.

88|Devil Boy, how's your cellphone reception?
88|Scene no. 503
88|No Reply
88|Scene no. 504
88|Still not very good.
88|At least it isn't out of range.
88|I guess we got lucky earlier.
88|Dunno, it doesn't look like Kagenui's sent us a reply.
88|Then maybe we should just borrow someone's phone and call her.
88|Weak as the cellphone reception may be,
88|surely they have some landlines around here.
88|Would we be able to reach her directly if she was done with work?
88|There are times when that happens, and times when it doesn't.
88|It's pretty random.
88|Random?
88|It's her pet theory that it's dangerous to have a set pattern in one's lifestyle.
88|That so?
88|Scene no. 514
88|That reminds me, Oshino tried to avoid having a set lifestyle as well.
88|What, is it a common rule among the Occult Research Club of old?
88|Apparently Gaen Izuko was part of that circle too, come to think of it.
88|What? Really?
88|Then she's a friend of Oshino's.
88|A friend of Oshino's and Kaiki's.
88|Man, that's kind of a weird connection.
88|I think my sister said she was her senior.
88|A senior with a bad personality.
88|Damn right he is.
88|Scene no. 526
88|Does their circle have a single decent human being?
88|Scene no. 526
88|Excuse me! We're travelers.
88|Could you give us something to eat, please?

88|Uh...

88|Sorry to keep you waiting.
88|Er...
88|Wait, "keep you waiting?"
88|I was the one waiting for you, though.
88|Nice to meet you.
88|I'm Gaen Izuko—
88|the lady who knows everything.
88|Don't worry, I'll always remember your voice
88|Here's the path where I ran toward you
88|This is the sky I admired
88|Here we spend the time of our life
88|Will you laugh?
88|Will you be angry?
88|I just can't give up, and you're probably going to be angry with me
88|Countless times
88|I try to reign my feelings in
88|(forevermore)
88|I still want a lie to deceive me
88|Come on, forgive me,
88|because my feelings are so chaotic
88|Yeah, I want you to know

89|Through my heart—
89|Animation Number 326

89|I doubt that has changed since then. Now, what to do...
89|But it didn't chase you 400 years ago, right?
89|Maybe after we managed to escape, that's it.
89|That may be true, but that may not be true.
89|We need countermeasures, and if possible, I'd like to strike first.
89|If all the residents of this area are spirited away, it'll be too late.
89|It's not just our problem. This town... Those who live where I was born and raised...
89|I have to act, or else everyone could end up missing.
89|For now, when Hachikuji wakes up, we can explain things and split up to start a full effort to...
89|I don't think you should do that, devil boy.
89|Ononoki-chan...
89|You shouldn't believe everything that hag says. If you act how she wants, you'll see lots of trouble.

89|I didn't think you'd still have the nerve to call me a hag to my face, tsukumo-gami girl.
89|You're scared and trembling inside anyway.
89|In light of your courage, I'll spare you from being eaten to death this instant.
89|We'll see. Wouldn't that be hard in your current state?
89|If you insist, I'll play along with you...
89|All right?
89|Hmph, a rematch?
89|H-Hey, stop it, both of you.
89|Or rather, Ononoki-chan...
89|What?
89|I mean, why'd you go and stand in the hallway? You didn't have to lie that you had work.
89|The part about me having work wasn't a lie. I just delayed my plans a bit.
89|Well, that old hag there is pretty narrow-minded. I thought she might hesitate to talk if I was here.
89|Hey, hey, don't misunderstand me. Do I look like such an intolerant person?

89|Shinobu Time Part Three
89|Font used in the video: HGP Mincho B
89|Oh no! She caught me off guard!
89|Now's the time! Get her!
89|Don't assume I'll be an accomplice.
89|You can fondle her breasts!
89|No, stuff like that isn't a turn-on if it's not one-on-one...
89|When I think about it, this is a very dreamlike situation. First off, I'm in this classroom. And around me I have...
89|A girl, a young girl, and a little girl.
89|What is this place, Shangri-La?
89|You realize you're speaking every thought you're having?
89|Whoa, that was close. Barely safe.
89|True, that statement cut it close...
89|Who would've thought a plot development would put them in one place? It's a wonderful bonus stage!
89|He's grinning about something.
89|That's how he is.
89|Careful. He's the type that stalks you for the rest of your life after one kiss.
89|Oh, my
89|By the way, since we have the opportunity, let's make something clear.
89|Who do you like most among the three of us?
89|True. We should have that made clear.
89|U-Um, if I had to pick among the three here...
89|...of course it'd be my one and the same, my partner, Shinobu.
89|You...
89|I'd like to hear what you'd think if we weren't one and the same, or partners.
89|This is clearly venting. Nothing more than harassing me!
89|No, while we're at it, rather than we three...
89|Between me, Ms. Tsundere, and Cat Class Prez...
89|What you should tell us is who you would pick from those.
89|Before that, Ononoki-chan, what did you think of Shinobu's story?
89|She said she had no idea what the "darkness" was, but were you able to think of something by association?
89|"Before that"?
89|Is the issue of who you like most something that you can dismiss just like that?
89|Where am I?
89|Hachikuji!
89|Thank goodness! You're awake?
89|You were totally out, so I thought you got hit somewhere bad or were beyond the point of no return.
89|You had me so worried! But I'm so glad you woke up all right!
89|Damn it, let me touch you more! Let me lick you more! Let me suck on you more!
89|Stop fooling around! What do you think you're doing right in front of me, fool!
89|I just joined in.
89|W-Wait, you guys!
89|I understand your feelings, but calm down! Is now the time?
89|By the way, Hachikuji, are you really okay? The examination didn't reveal anything just now.
89|Are you a doctor?
89|I'm fine. Nothing's wrong!
89|All okay! All green! It's perfect!
89|In the first place, I didn't find that unknown thing to be a problem at all, Araragi-san.
89|But I will say thanks, Araragi-san.
89|Come on, they do say "good fences make good neighbors," but we don't need stuff like that between us.
89|No, it wasn't for the hug earlier. I thanked you for not abandoning me and for escaping from that thing with me.
89|I had thought in situations like that...
89|...you would just shake me off and escape to safety by yourself.
89|Zero confidence!
89|Besides, I was also happy you didn't ignore the red light.
89|You were being considerate to me, right?
89|Hachikuji.
89|I wouldn't have minded if you ignored it.
89|I'm not that high-strung.
89|I'm so disappointed in you!
89|Now, everyone! Now that I'm awake, let's switch gears. Get this, Shinobu-san, Ononoki-san.
89|I respect your individuality, but this one time, I beg you to not fall out of step.
89|Today's the day our teamwork will be tested.
89|S-Sure.
89|Somehow Hachikuji's in the lead, and the other two are following.
89|Then, Code Name Gold, situation report please.
89|Okay!
89|Hey! That's probably enough from you.
89|I'll eat you soon enough.
89|Can you really eat me?
89|About what you said earlier...
89|Earlier?
89|About whether I had a clue.
89|About whether or not I thought of something after hearing that old hag's story.
89|Ononoki-chan...
89|Sorry, but can you honestly stop calling Shinobu an old hag already?
89|In the first place, society is behaving as if that term never existed.
89|Black Scene
89|Animation Number 'none'
89|Then what should I call her?
89|Devil girl?
89|Shinobu = 8 years old.
89|Then say Aberration Killer.
89|I guess I have no choice. For now, I'll let devil boy save face.
89|Then let me state my conclusion after hearing Aberration Killer's story by chance...
89|Yeah, did you think of something?
89|That isn't an aberration. It's something else.
89|So Aberration Killer and the so-called original Aberration Killer couldn't deal with it.
89|Of course not, since different rules moved it.
89|Naturally, you won't be able to either.
89|Animation Number 235
89|However...
89|If it isn't an aberration, what is it? That "darkness"... Exactly what is it then?
89|I don't know its specific name, but I do know someone who does.
89|Then who knows the truth about that "darkness"?
89|Gaen Izuko.
89|She knows everything.
89|Let's escape, everyone!
89|Yeah!
89|Hachikuji!
89|Void
89|Come over here!
89|O-Okay!
89|Void
89|Ononoki-chan! Now!
89|Wha... You're too daring.
89|Void
89|Stop that. Don't touch me in weird places. What are you thinking?
89|You're the one thinking weird thoughts!
89|We're escaping, Ononoki-chan! Like before!
89|Void
89|Oh, that's what you mean...
89|Void
89|Unlimited Rulebook.
89|Void
89|Secession version.
89|22nd of August
89|Where are we?
89|I don't know where this is, devil boy.
89|It's not following us? That "darkness"...
89|It seems not. Well, it seems true that it's weak against vertical movement.
89|Aberration Killer escaped it that way 400 years ago, so it was good that we jumped vertically again.
89|Where's Hachikuji? I hope she wasn't thrown off.
89|She's fine. You had a firm grip on her breasts.
89|She's sleeping under that tree.
89|What time is it now? Or rather, how long was I passed out?
89|For how long? Long enough to be toyed around by both me and Hachikuji-san.
89|What'd you do while I was out?
89|Wait, Hachikuji-san? When'd you get friendly?
89|Specifically, one evening. You were out since twilight, so roughly 12 hours or so.
89|12 hours...
89|A word of caution. The rule that it can't chase us vertically is only theoretical.
89|After all, it's "for now." It's not guaranteed next time.
89|Right. Theory aside, I can't figure out the rules for that "darkness" at all.
89|What is it?
89|How's Hachikuji?
89|Now, what to do...
89|We don't even know where this is...
89|I'd like to retaliate in some way, but can we do so effectively?
89|First of all, I'm not sure whether it's really after us.
89|Saying it's after Shinobu is nothing more than a theory.
89|Forming the basis of retaliation requires you to ask.
89|Ask?
89|Gather information. Did you forget what I was telling you right before it appeared?
89|I told you someone knows about the phenomenon that isn't an aberration, right?
89|Gaen...
89|Gaen Izuko. I need to ask her about this. She's acquaintances with Kagenui-san, right?
89|If so, then for our route, I need to approach Kagenui-san first.
89|Ononoki-chan, are you caught up on work?
89|Of course not. But I can't readily go back to work right now.
89|I'm not that cold-hearted.
89|Can you contact Kagenui-san?
89|It's my last resort, but I do have several ways to access her.
89|Though all are impossible in the mountains.
89|You can't use telepathy?
89|Unfortunately, our bond isn't that strong.
89|We'd have to go down this mountain and approach her by calling or texting.
89|Or rather, devil boy... Can you pull Aberration Killer out of your shadow already?
89|I don't know if she doesn't want to talk to me or if she's taking a nap,
89|but she hasn't shown up since we landed here.
89|Shinobu isn't...
89|But it's night.
89|But why?
89|Why isn't Shinobu awake?
89|"Why"? Devil boy, that's not something to ask me.
89|I have difficulty answering... Or rather, because she hates me...
89|It's true that Shinobu doesn't like you too much...
89|...but she wouldn't hide in the shadows now of all times just because of that.
89|She's not like that.
89|You really trust her...
89|Then what does this mean?
89|I think it's unlikely, but is she unconscious in the shadow or badly injured for some reason?
89|I wonder if she could get badly injured in the shadow.
89|It's like her own super-dimension in there, and she should be completely free from physical shocks and stimuli.
89|Ononoki-chan, this means I have to kiss you.
89|How so?
89|Like yesterday, we have to approach Shinobu with that as motivation.
89|We have to kiss. Smooching with tongue is the only way!
89|If there's no other way, I will... But I kinda don't want to.
89|Um, Araragi-san.
89|Jealous, Hachikuji? If anything, you can be the girl I kiss.
89|You should say so sooner if that's it.
89|Araragi-san, please die.
89|That's not it. Please wait.
89|Why do I have to wait for my kiss with Ononoki-chan?
89|No, Araragi-san, there are countless reasons...
89|But before that, still, about Shinobu-san...
89|In other words, she's not in your shadow?
89|Right now, she's...
89|No, I don't think she's gone...
89|Devil boy, a moment...
89|Ononoki-chan...
89|Quiet. I'm searching now.
89|I'm seeking...
89|Not here.
89|She's not here.
89|I saw it then. How the "darkness" overlapped Araragi-san's shadow.
89|Void
89|Perhaps it was then that Shinobu-san got swallowed by that "darkness"?
89|It's really only a "perhaps," but...
89|Shinobu was swallowed by that "darkness"...
89|No way...
89|No, I don't think so.
89|Void
89|If she really was swallowed by it, devil boy would completely lose his vampiric nature.
89|He'd be a normal human.
89|But that didn't happen.
89|No, but can you really tell whether or not I've lost my vampiric nature, Ononoki-chan?
89|Void
89|No, even you can easily distinguish whether you have.
89|Because you can see Hachikuji-san right now, right?
89|Yeah.
89|Void
89|If you can clearly see an aberration...
89|...you haven't lost your vampiric nature.
89|I see her. I can see her.
89|She is surely there.
89|I see...
89|She hasn't disappeared. But in this situation...
89|Void
89|...it's better to assume your pairing has been severed.
89|The pairing's been severed?
89|To be more precise, it could be that the pairing was eradicated.
89|Because that "darkness" overlapped your shadow.
89|Void
89|If contact with my shadow back then broke the pairing...
89|If so, what then?
89|Void
89|In other words, Shinobu is no longer tied to my shadow, right?
89|If so...
89|Most likely, we left Aberration Killer behind at that location.
89|You've got to be kidding. Then I left Shinobu behind right where that unknown "darkness" is?
89|Please calm down, Araragi-san.
89|Don't blame yourself. Ononoki-san said so too.
89|The fact that you can see me means that Shinobu-san is still alive.
89|This isn't the worst-case scenario.
89|Right. That's true.
89|Let's head down. I have to hurry to her.
89|I know how you feel, but don't be impatient.
89|We should head down, but we need to contact my master before we reunite with Aberration Killer.
89|Oh, right...
89|Well, in any case, we should move from here with your "Unlimited Rulebook," secession version.
89|No, you're mistaken.
89|Unfortunately, I can't use "Unlimited Rulebook," secession version.
89|Why?
89|Your broken pairing means at the very least...
89|...that you're not immortal right now.
89|That's why you couldn't handle that "secession" earlier.
89|You've gotten weaker. I'm not talking about just "Unlimited Rulebook," secession version either.
89|It's best to assume you can't do reckless things like in the past two months.
89|Ononoki-chan phrased it as getting weaker. To be precise, that's incorrect.
89|It's not "getting weaker." It's "reverting to normal."
89|My vampiric nature's not gone. It's lessened.
89|My immortality isn't gone either. It's lessened.
89|But on the other hand, is Shinobu's vampiric nature increasing?
89|With the pairing broken, conversely...
89|No, I think it's decreased even on her side. Like a chain reaction.
89|That's how your relationship works.
89|So it's not just me. Shinobu's condition will only worsen.
89|But I need to calm down. It's not over yet. The story is still continuing.
89|Stand By
89|You said texts were a way to reach Kagenui-san, right?
89|What do I write?
89|Our secret password and an encrypted text that says I await contact.
89|This is in passing, but I decided to text Senjougahara, Hanekawa, Karen, and Tsukihi that I was all right.
89|Send

89|You mistyped and had "dont vorry."
89|Senjougahara Hi
89|No Subject
89|Won't be home for a while. Don't vorry.
89|Send
89|Won't be home for a while. Don't vorry.
89|What's with telling me just after I sent it!
89|23rd of August
89|Devil boy, how do the bars look on your phone?
89|Weak as always. Better than no reception, I guess.
89|We were lucky before.
89|I dunno. No reply from Kagenui-san, it seems.
89|Hmm... Maybe it's better to call at this point. Let's ask someone in one of these houses.
89|Weak cell-phone reception doesn't mean there aren't landlines.
89|If her work's done, do calls reach Kagenui-san directly?
89|Well, sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't... It's pretty random.
89|Random?
89|It's her theory that it's dangerous to create patterns in lifestyle.
89|Come to think of it, Oshino tried to prevent creating patterns in everyday life too.
89|What, is it some global rule among the previous occult studies club members?
89|By the way, Gaen Izuko was apparently a member of that club too.
89|Really? Then she knows Oshino too.
89|Oshino and Kaiki... Some strange ties.
89|I think she said she was an upperclassman... One with a horrible personality.
89|Excuse me, we're travelers. We'd like some food...
89|No, um...
89|Can we borrow your phone for a bit?
89|Excuse me, we're travelers...
89|Yes, yes!
89|Sorry to make you wait.
89|Um...
89|Sorry to make you wait. Though I'm the one who's been waiting.

90|I guess you'd call it an all-seeing clairvoyance.
90|Though, realistically speaking,
90|the biggest clue I had was the fact that the job I'd tasked Yotsugi with through a middleman
90|showed no signs of progress.
90|I wondered why she wasn't showing up at the appointed place.
90|When I looked into it, I found out you were involved, Koyomin.
90|And I did know about Shinobu and Mayoi, after all.

90|Scene no. 108
90|Declaration empty of logic
90|Scene no. 108
90|That said, I don't like it when someone's completely dependent on me.
90|Those trades are too unbalanced, you see.
90|So let me depend on you too, Koyomin.
90|Depend on me?
90|I'm saying we should be buddies.
90|Before I give you information that would prove beneficial to you,
90|I'd like you to fulfill three requests of mine.
90|Scene no. 125
90|Black
90|Unnumbered Scene
90|People survive by helping each other out—
90|Black
90|Unnumbered Scene
90|that's the only way we can survive.
90|Equivalence
90|Scene no. 128
90|Favor
90|Scene no. 128
90|I understand.
90|Three requests, right?
90|I promise to fulfill them.
90|Oh? Are you sure you want to accept them before you know what they entail?
90|I'm in a situation where I have to do whatever you ask me to do.
90|Forget three, I could take on a hundred requests right now.
90|Is she that important to you?
90|Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade
90|Scene no. 132
90|I guess.
90|Anyway, we're running out of time!
90|You said you guaranteed our safety, but I'm sure you can't say the same for Shinobu.
90|You worry about her first?
90|She really must be precious to you, Koyomin.
90|What a weird thing to say.
90|Scene no. 139
90|Starting there—
90|Scene no. 139
90|That makes it sound like it's not what this is all about.
90|Scene no. 139
90|All right, let's get this over with.
90|Firstly:
90|I want you to introduce me to someone.
90|As soon as possible, too.
90|Who would that be?
90|The Gaen name
90|Scene no. 151
90|Gaen Suruga—
90|I believe I asked her—
90|Scene no. 152
90|Wait, I guess she's Kanbaru Suruga now.
90|I asked her.
90|Scene no. 154
90|She's my niece.
90|Oh...
90|Wait, why can't you go see her yourself if you're relatives?
90|That would only lead to me making quite the bad impression on her.
90|The Gaen bloodline's quite complicated, you see.
90|They don't look alike.
90|Scene no. 158
90|Fine, I'll introduce you to her if you want,
90|but I'll still have to ask her first.
90|If she declines—
90|That's fine.
90|I'll think of something else if she doesn't want to see me.
90|However,
90|Aunt
90|Scene no. 161
90|don't introduce me as her aunt.
90|Niece
90|Scene no. 162
90|That's absurd.
90|Hard
90|Scene no. 163
90|I'm taking Suruga's feelings into consideration here.
90|Easy
90|Scene no. 164
90|Now let's move on to the second request.
90|Second Favor
90|Scene no. 165
90|This mess Yotsugi's gotten mixed up in has hindered the task I entrusted her with.
90|So here's my second request.
90|Could you help out with that once this case is closed?
90|Together with Kanbaru, you mean?
90|Exactly.
90|I need her left arm right now.
90|0 0 3
90|Monkey
90|Scene no. 171
90|Of course, that also depends on whether she's willing to help.
90|If she doesn't want to lend me a hand,
90|I'll drop it right then and there.
90|That said, Koyomin,
90|you'll have to help me no matter what.
90|Got it.
90|I'm okay with that.
90|So what's the third?
90|I have no choice but to consent
90|Scene no. 178
90|You already answered that question yourself.
90|My third request was to ask Suruga to help me out.
90|Since you've already accepted that,
90|I can now save you.
90|Acceptance
90|Black
90|Unnumbered Scene
90|That's a load off my mind.
90|I'm so glad I could be of help to you.
90|Oh, really?
90|I'm not relieved at all
90|Scene no. 186
90|Shinobu is in trouble
90|Scene no. 186
90|I can't rest easy
90|Scene no. 186
90|Um, I'm sorry, but could we discuss this on the go?
90|I want to see Shinobu as soon as possible.
90|Koyomin, I won't say anything bad,
90|but you guys shouldn't leave this place.
90|Strict
90|Scene no. 191
90|Severe
90|Scene no. 191
90|Harsh Sound
90|Scene no. 191
90|Not until you hear me out, at the very least.
90|Scene no. 195
90|Going back to town would be the worst possible choice to make.
90|we'll get nowhere,
90|Scene no. 199
90|so let me say this
90|Scene no. 199
90|You should avoid that at all costs.
90|For now, I'd say you guys should stay here.
90|You did the right thing by running all the way out to this remote location.
90|But due to that, I'm not together with Shinobu anymore.
90|That link can be repaired in no time.
90|I promise you that.
90|No, I mean, isn't it risky to have Shinobu act alone?
90|She's the one being targeted.
90|I guess I should've first cleared up the misunderstanding that Shinobu's the target here.
90|Huh?
90|Reflexively
90|Scene no. 211
90|I ask back
90|Scene no. 211
90|Are you saying she's not?
90|Four hundred years ago, she was.
90|But this time, she's not.
90|Does that mean you know who that phenomenon's after this time?
90|Of course.
90|is nothing but
90|Scene no. 221
90|luck
90|Scene no. 221
90|The one being targeted by the darkness this time...
90|is the exhausted girl sleeping over there.
90|I mean...
90|it's Hachikuji Mayoi.
90|Scene no. 229
90|I look at Hachikuji
90|Scene no. 230
90|I look at the exhausted, sleeping Hachikuji—
90|Scene no. 230
90|My absolute favorite ghost girl.
90|Scene no. 230
90|H-Hachikuji?
90|I see.
90|I thought that might be the case.
90|Really?
90|I'd heard about something like that from my sister.
90|It could've been either of them, though.
90|Well, if I had to say,
90|it could've been you too, Devil Boy.
90|But the one I thought most likely to be the target was Hachikuji.
90|What do you mean?
90|It went for Hachikuji,
90|Scene no. 244
90|It went for Hachikuji first,
90|Scene no. 244
90|it seemed.
90|Scene no. 244
90|So I felt.
90|Scene no. 244
90|Let me answer that question for you.
90|That's why I'm here, after all.
90|Scene no. 249
90|The darkness isn't an oddity.
90|It's an entirely different existence—
90|White
90|Unnumbered Scene
90|more like a non-existence.
90|A non-existence, not an existence
90|Scene no. 255
90|It can't be defeated.
90|It can't be killed.
90|Of course, it can't be eaten either.
90|Eat
90|Scene no. 260
90|Absurd and irrational—
90|that's what that non-existence is.
90|Something that doesn't exist—
90|something that eliminates oddities.
90|Antioddity for Oddity
90|Scene no. 274
90|When they collide, they are annihilated—
90|Scene no. 274
90|As for why she's being targeted, it's neither absurd nor irrational.
90|Strictly speaking, that thing goes after oddities that have gone down the wrong path.
90|People who have strayed from the right path get thrown out of society, don't they?
90|In the same vein, oddities that have strayed from the right path get removed from the world.
90|By a supernatural power, that is.
90|Koyomi / Question
90|Scene no. 282
90|You don't get it?
90|Try thinking about exactly what Shinobu did four hundred years ago.
90|Yes, that's exactly right.
90|Four hundred years ago, Shinobu pretended to be a god.
90|As a demon she acted like a god.
90|Scene no. 287
90|I know what you want to say. "She didn't say she was a god! People just misunderstood," right?
90|But, you know,
90|not trying to clear up misunderstandings is basically the same as lying.
90|Becoming a god is all well and good. Nobody can fault you for that.
90|However, you shouldn't lie about it.
90|She didn't become a god, but pretended to be one. That's where she went wrong.
90|That's what made her the target of punishment.
90|Black
90|Unnumbered Scene
90|Now you understand why she was able to escape the non-existence too, right?
90|Clearly
90|Scene no. 305
90|It's because she acted like a vampire once she jumped all the way to the South Pole.
90|She made a servant.
90|It exposed her lie about being a god,
90|That was enough to make the non-existence lose its motive.
90|At the end of the day, Shinobu was punished.
90|The offender's lie was exposed.
90|Scene no. 311
90|Oddities should not lie to themselves.
90|Scene no. 311
90|There's no reason for her to be targeted now.
90|So she's safe.
90|Who isn't safe, then?
90|You know, right?
90|Hachikuji Mayoi, it's you,
90|my little liar girl.
90|First off, stop pretending to be asleep!
90|Scene no. 321
90|A-Araragi!
90|It's okay, calm down.
90|I don't really get what's going on, but I'm on your side.
90|Okay.
90|What do you mean?
90|What's Hachikuji lying about?
90|I still had no idea what was going on.
90|Scene no. 329
90|She's lying about being right there.
90|I wanted to talk to Shinobu.
90|Scene no. 334
90|I wanted to talk to Senjougahara and Hanekawa.
90|Scene no. 334
90|I wanted to talk to Karen and Tsukihi.
90|Scene no. 334
90|In truth, you've passed on already,
90|haven't you, Mayoi?
90|I didn't want to have to face—
90|Scene no. 336
90|reality.
90|Scene no. 336
90|And yet, you're still right there.
90|You're lying about it, saying you're there.
90|That'd obviously make someone mad.
90|They'd snap even if they weren't that non-existence.
90|I never intended to lie.
90|Like I said, a misunderstanding is as good as a lie,
90|Hachikuji Mayoi.
90|In short, you're like the ghost of a ghost right now.
90|Unfortunately for you, the world won't accept an existence as meta as you.
90|An existence like that is fated to be swallowed whole by the non-existence.
90|The ghost of a ghost?
90|Hachikuji Mayoi is the ghost of a girl who died in a traffic accident eleven years ago.
90|To be precise, she's a snail oddity—the lost cow.
90|Lost Cow
90|Scene no. 350
90|An oddity getting people lost.
90|Scene no. 350
90|But Koyomin, his girlfriend, and Meme the novice solved that problem.
90|Mayoi had no longer lost her way.
90|And yet, she's still right there.
90|If that's not a lie, then what is?
90|is nothing
90|Scene no. 380
90|but a Lost Cow.
90|Scene no. 380
90|So long as she's the lost cow,
90|she has to make people lose their way.
90|She hasn't been doing that, though.
90|An oddities lot is
90|Scene no. 381
90|harsh
90|Scene no. 381
90|I've gone to Senjougahara's place with Hachikuji once.
90|I've never lost my way when I've been with her.
90|In fact, she's even showed me the way from time to time.
90|Black
90|Unnumbered Scene
90|So I figured she was no longer the lost cow.
90|That's how I viewed her.
90|That's how I... observed her.
90|I was— deceived.
90|Scene no. 391
90|You got played like a fiddle.
90|It's a bit too late to realize that, though.
90|Hasn't she been lying to you the entire time?
90|No.
90|She...
90|Hachikuji hasn't lied to me.
90|Not once. Never.
90|Araragi...
90|But I couldn't look back then.
90|Scene no. 404
90|I
90|Scene no. 404
90|looked at Gaen.
90|Scene no. 404
90|I guess.
90|You're right.
90|That was just a misunderstanding of mine.
90|The one she lied to was herself, huh?
90|Scene no. 408
90|Either way, so long as she's strayed from her path,
90|Mayoi will be judged and punished.
90|Judged and punished?
90|Resistance
90|Scene no. 411
90|No way... but...
90|Refusal
90|Scene no. 412
90|We don't have any proof now, do we?
90|It's not proven beyond doubt that Hachikuji's the target.
90|Proof
90|Scene no. 414
90|True, there's no actual physical evidence,
90|but there's plenty of circumstantial evidence, don't you think?
90|The darkness didn't pursue you when Mayoi was unconscious, right?
90|Are you saying the reason it didn't chase us the second time
90|was because she spent most of the time in the mountains sleeping due to exhaustion?
90|Together we walked
90|Scene no. 421
90|through mountains
90|Scene no. 421
90|that seemed to exhaust all our strength.
90|Scene no. 421
90|We fled,
90|Scene no. 423
90|having no idea
90|Scene no. 423
90|where to go—
90|Scene no. 423
90|Completely lost—
90|Scene no. 425
90|That's right.
90|You're currently lost.
90|Right now, one could say Mayoi's doing her job as the lost cow.
90|That's why the darkness isn't showing up.
90|It doesn't appear where Shinobu is
90|Scene no. 427
90|It doesn't appear where Hachikuji is
90|Scene no. 427
90|On the other hand, if you were to go back to your town—to your home—
90|she'll once again stop functioning as an oddity.
90|It's not her fault.
90|Scene no. 434
90|It's nobody's fault.
90|Scene no. 434
90|I'm convinced of it.
90|Scene no. 434
90|So what should we do?
90|Does Hachikuji have to go back to being the lost cow?
90|Does she have to keep making people lose their way like she used to—
90|I don't want to.
90|It's the only solution.
90|Scene no. 437
90|Stop with the lies.
90|Scene no. 437
90|Confess—
90|Scene no. 437
90|I don't want to do that ever again.
90|Hachikuji?
90|But...
90|Thanks to you, I could stop misleading people.
90|I managed to go back home.
90|So I'll never do it again.
90|I decided never to do something like that again,
90|and I decided to lie about it.
90|Live as you were meant to.
90|Scene no. 447
90|As an oddity.
90|Scene no. 447
90|Gaen!
90|Is there any way to defeat that darkness, then?
90|Like I said, such words don't apply to that thing.
90|It's like a law of sorts.
90|I was lost for words.
90|Scene no. 451
90|has never happened before.
90|Scene no. 451
90|It's okay, Araragi.
90|I mean, there's something we can do in that case.
90|What do you mean?
90|We just need to play it like usual.
90|We just need to deal with it by abiding by the rules.
90|Abiding by the rules?
90|What do you mean, Hachikuji?
90|The enemy is a law of nature
90|Scene no. 455
90|Be specific.
90|You can't violate
90|Scene no. 455
90|laws of nature—
90|Scene no. 455
90|To be specific,
90|I just have to disappear.
90|Scene no. 465
90|Gaen left like nothing ever happened.
90|She told us to wait for her to contact us,
90|and gave us her mobile number.
90|Ononoki,
90|why didn't you leave with her?
90|It's not a big deal.
90|Just like you, I'm lost too.
90|I figured the darkness might show up if I were to leave.
90|I see.
90|You're so nice.
90|She did the right thing, Araragi.
90|I wouldn't be the only one in trouble if it did show up.
90|Araragi,
90|are you trying to make me go through the same thing Shinobu did four hundred years ago?
90|Just let me go.
90|You're not playing fair!
90|In reality, I should've passed on during that Mother's Day.
90|I'm basically playing extra innings right now.
90|Or well, I guess it's more like a bonus stage.
90|I didn't think it'd last forever,
90|and it had to end sometime.
90|This day came surprisingly suddenly,
90|but that's just how it works, right?
90|I was lying anyway, but I wonder if I went a bit too far. I mean, I fell asleep at your place and all.
90|I was merely postponing my trip to the afterlife because of how much fun I had talking to you.
90|I wanted those fun times to last forever.
90|Hold it right there.
90|Don't try to bring everything to a close.
90|I'll think of something.
90|There's gotta be a way to turn things around—
90|There isn't. There aren't any openings.
90|In fact, don't you think the world's been rather nice to me?
90|Normally one isn't afforded months and months of time.
90|Who would be so kind as to wait for something as absurd as the ghost of a ghost?
90|Don't say that.
90|Look, I can't let you take everything upon yourself to save everyone else.
90|What are you talking about?
90|Isn't that what you've been doing all along?
90|You can't possibly do something yourself, then turn around and stop others from doing the same.
90|Why?
90|Why do you seem so calm and composed?!
90|Sure, it may look like that's what I've been doing,
90|but not once have I been cool about it!
90|I've been fighting while on the verge of tears—actually crying, in fact.
90|Why don't you seem the least bit uneasy or discontent?
90|I'd be lying if I said I wasn't uneasy,
90|but I'm not at all discontent.
90|I had fun, after all.
90|Now I'll just stick to watching over you from the heavens.
90|Stop talking like that!
90|Oh, I guess "disappear" was a poor choice of words.
90|I'll just be going back home, Araragi.
90|I'll be gone, but that won't mean I was never here to begin with.
90|They're basically the same thing.
90|Only the words are different.
90|Knock it off already, Devil Boy.
90|I can't tell who's the child here.
90|She's saying she's fine with it, so quit complaining.
90|She's right.
90|I'm saying I'm fine with it.
90|You just don't get it, do you?!
90|Stop talking about yourself all the time and put yourself in my shoes for a second!
90|If that's what it has come down to,
90|I'd rather spend my entire life lost with you!
90|Araragi...
90|Oh, right.
90|We could do that!
90|That would solve everything!
90|Be it in the mountains or some unknown village,
90|I just have to spend my entire life lost with you.
90|That way, you'll keep doing your job as the lost cow.
90|There won't be any problems!
90|Araragi—
90|Yeah, it's settled.
90|Let's go with that.
90|I'm half-vampire, and I don't know how long I'll stay alive,
90|but I should be able to live another ten or twenty years, easy—
90|Araragi!
90|What are you talking about?
90|You want to use up twenty years of your life for me?
90|What about Senjougahara?
90|And don't forget Hanekawa or your sisters.
90|Even if you assume you get Shinobu caught up in this, what will you do about them?!
90|Well, I'll think about it.
90|Thinking won't accomplish anything.
90|You can't choose all the options.
90|You can't be Casanova.
90|Even Casanova wouldn't be able to.
90|Come on, Araragi.
90|"We'll always be together even if we're apart."
90|"The memories I have won't disappear."
90|"She's always by my side."
90|"Our bond will live forever."
90|"She'll show up to help someday when I need it most."
90|Please tell yourself stuff like that and come to terms with it!
90|Like hell I'm gonna accept random crap like that!
90|Don't screw with me!
90|It's okay already, Araragi.
90|These three months I spent having fun conversations with you
90|more than made up for the eleven years I spent lost all alone.
90|So you've done enough, really.
90|Thank you very much.
90|Oh, right.
90|Let's do that one last time.
90|That?
90|The back-and-forth that starts with "I bit my tongue."
90|What the heck?
90|So you were doing it on purpose all along?
90|Isn't that obvious?
90|Nobody bites their tongue like that.
90|So shall we?
90|Come to think of it, we haven't done it once this time.
90|Think of it as a parting gift to me.
90|Please.
90|Fine.
90|My apologies.
90|I bit your tongue.
90|I loved you, Araragi.
90|Don't worry, I'll always remember your voice
90|Here's the path where I ran toward you
90|This is the sky I admired
90|Here we spend the time of our life
90|Will you laugh?
90|Will you be angry?
90|I just can't give up, and you're probably going to be angry with me
90|Countless times
90|I try to reign my feelings in
90|(forevermore)
90|I still want a lie to deceive me
90|Come on, forgive me,
90|because my feelings are so chaotic
90|Yeah, I want you to know
90|that the life you found me past despair is real
90|Don't forget that
90|Scene no. 615
90|Four Months Later
90|Scene no. 616
90|So what happened after that?
90|What's the epilogue, or well, how does this story end?
90|Not much, really.
90|Uh, Hachikuji passed on,
90|Ononoki and I came back to this town,
90|and as promised, we helped Gaen out with her work.
90|If anything, that was the major incident here.
90|That was terrible, wasn't it?
90|You have my sympathy.
90|In the end I did nothing.
90|Scene no. 627
90|I was just being led around.
90|Scene no. 627
90|By Hachikuji
90|Scene no. 627
90|—and by fate.
90|Scene no. 627
90|I still wonder if there was anything else we could've done.
90|Nah, you just barely made the right decision.
90|She was extremely wise in choosing to pass on herself instead of getting eaten by the darkness.
90|Lilac
90|Unnumbered Scene
90|Anyway, that was a pretty good story.
90|Thanks a lot, Araragi.
90|Nah, talking about it made me feel better too.
90|Oh, please accept my gratitude.
90|Well then, I have lots of work to do,
90|so I'll be leaving for the day.
90|Hey, Ougi.
90|What's this work you speak of?
90|Normal work.
90|If I were to liken it to something,
90|it's work as commonplace as the overwhelming darkness that comprises most of this world.
90|I right wrongs and bring to an end that which must end.
90|If I had to be specific, I guess my job involves punishing liars.
90|Don't worry, you'll find out eventually.
90|There's a chance I might need your help in the future, after all.
90|Bye.
90|It's like everyone's leaving me behind and going off somewhere.
90|I feel deserted.
90|Yellow
90|Unnumbered Scene
90|My master, I'm sure you don't need me to tell you this,
90|but that girl from earlier is probably something.
90|Yeah, I guess.
90|You may well be right.
90|What, you knew?
90|Nah, it's all a mystery to me.
90|I'd love to know everything.
90|Nothing I think about helps me.
90|Scene no. 653
90|I give up where I should try to fight
90|Scene no. 653
90|and I've even stopped
90|Scene no. 653
90|being sad about it, I think.
90|Scene no. 653
90|Anyway, I've kept Hachikuji's disappearance a secret from everyone.
90|Let's see how telling Ougi, and Ougi alone, affects things.
90|That's what I feel.
90|Scene no. 655
90|That's my impression.
90|Scene no. 655
90|Oh?
90|I thought it was odd how you were running your mouth. That's what you were after, eh?
90|Snooping around, are we?
90|Well, how long will this last?
90|Dunno.
90|Until we get some kind of result, I guess.
90|I'll have to tell Ononoki to keep it a secret, too.
90|Hanekawa or the likes might figure it out in an instant,
90|but let's keep pretending Hachikuji's still in this town.
90|Are you sure you aren't just reluctant to let it go?
90|Keep lying like that, and you'll end up being swallowed whole by the darkness.
90|Oh, please.
90|With my shoes in hand,
90|Scene no. 665
90|I went home.
90|Scene no. 665
90|The path I always use.
90|Scene no. 666
90|Now empty of anybody I could meet.
90|Scene no. 667
90|Come to think of it, on that day four months ago—
90|when I parted with Hachikuji—
90|I forgot to say a certain something.
90|There must be something wrong with me, considering I only realized that now.
90|Goodbye, Hachikuji Mayoi.
90|I was happy I met you.

91|Animation Number 653
91|being sad about it, I think.
91|Animation Number 653
91|That's what I feel.
91|Animation Number 655
91|That's my impression.
91|Animation Number 655
91|With my shoes in hand,
91|Animation Number 665
91|I went home.
91|Animation Number 665
91|The path I always use.
91|Animation Number 666
91|Now empty of anybody I could meet.
91|Animation Number 667
91|Yeah, I guess this is a good place to talk.
91|Come on, what are you standing there for, Yotsugi? Come over here.
91|But, Gaen-san...
91|Just come over here.
91|Now, because you probably want to know, I will explain the current situation.
91|Kagenui, when she got your text for help, was in the middle of work.
91|Unfortunately, complications with her job put her a bit behind schedule.
91|So she ignored that text.
91|No matter what the issue was, she thought that Yotsugi would be enough to handle it, you know?
91|But I knew otherwise.
91|This wasn't a problem that you guys could handle by yourselves.
91|That's why I came to help like this. Acting the hero.
91|So in other words, I've saved you a bit of time and trouble. Several days, in fact.
91|Somehow, the more explanations I hear, the more the mysteries multiply.
91|Hmm? What is it, Koyomi-kun? Was there something lacking in my explanation?
91|No.
91|She's calling me "Koyomi-kun" an hour after we met. That's way too familiar for me.
91|Well, since you ask, I'd like to know how you knew we were here.
91|We didn't even know ourselves which mountain we landed on.
91|I know everything, Koyomin.
91|Koyomin?
91|A nickname! Is she Senjougahara when we're alone?
91|Clairvoyance sees through all, you know?
91|Well, to be a bit more realistic...
91|...it all started when I wondered why the job I requested of Yotsugi...
91|...through a third party wasn't progressing.
91|I wondered why Yotsugi wasn't showing up at the job site.
91|After some research, I found you were involved, Koyomin.
91|I knew about Shinobu-chan and Mayoi-chan as well.

91|Any other questions?
91|Do you already know, Gaen-san?
91|About the situation we're in and what we're up against?
91|I know. Well, that thing is an existence I'd rather not know about.
91|Unfortunately, I'm someone that even knows things of that nature.
91|Truly problematic.
91|Then...
91|But don't rush things.
91|You say not to rush, but...
91|It's all right.
91|There's no danger, at least at present.
91|It's safe for now. I'll guarantee that.
91|However, I don't like situations where I'm the only one who's relied on.
91|It creates bad balance.
91|So I'd like you, Koyomin, to let me rely on you.
91|Let you rely on me?
91|I'm saying let's be friends.
91|Anyway, before I give you any valuable information, Koyomin, I'd like to ask you three favors.
91|Humans live on by helping each other out.
91|That's how they can keep living.
91|All right.
91|Three, right? I promise you.
91|Oh? Are you okay with accepting them before hearing them?
91|No matter what they are, I have no choice right now.
91|So it doesn't matter if it's 3 or 100.
91|Is she such an important being to you?
91|Well, yes...
91|But I really don't have any time.
91|Even if you were to guarantee our safety, you can't possibly guarantee Shinobu's safety as well.
91|If that's the first thing you're worried about, you really must think dearly of Shinobu-chan, Koyomin.
91|All right. Then I'll hurry up and tell you.
91|First off...
91|I'd like you to introduce me to someone. And I'm in a hurry.
91|Who are you talking about?
91|Gaen Suruga.
91|Oh no, she is Kanbaru Suruga now.
91|She is my niece.
91|Right... But if you're a relative, you should just go visit her yourself.
91|If I did, I'd give her a pretty bad first impression.
91|The blood of the Gaen clan is pretty complicated.
91|Introduce you... Well, if you're asking me to do so, I will.
91|However, I'd have to get Kanbaru's permission first.
91|If she refuses...
91|That's fine. If she says she doesn't want to see me, then I'll think of an alternate method.
91|However...
91|I don't want you to introduce me as her aunt.
91|That's rather selfish...
91|I'm thinking of Suruga's feelings.
91|Now...
91|Next, the second favor.
91|Because Yotsugi got involved in this case...
91|...slight issues have now surfaced with the job I left in her hands.
91|So the second favor is for you to help just a little bit with that job once this case has been resolved.
91|That means you want Kanbaru with me as well?
91|Correct. At this point, I need Suruga's "left hand."
91|0 0 3
91|Of course, that's based on Suruga's will as well.
91|If she says she doesn't want to help, then I'll pull back immediately.
91|Though, Koyomin, your help will definitely be needed.
91|All right. If that's what you want.
91|And, what's the third favor?
91|No, you've already mentioned the third favor.
91|The third favor was for you to ask Suruga to help out with that other job as well.
91|Since you've already accepted that, I can finally help you out now, Koyomin.
91|Acceptance
91|Gaen is relieved. I'm glad I can be of help to you.
91|Is that so?
91|Um, excuse me, Gaen-san. If that is the case, can we talk as we move along?
91|I'd like to see Shinobu soon.
91|Koyomin, this is for your own good, but you guys shouldn't move from here.
91|At least...
91|...not until you've listened to what I have to say.
91|Returning to town would be the worst possible choice to make.
91|That is the one thing you cannot do.
91|For now, you should all stay here in this location.
91|It was correct to flee to such a remote location.
91|But because of that, I've gotten separated from Shinobu.
91|About that pairing... It will be revived soon. I'll promise you that.
91|No, wait, isn't it dangerous to let Shinobu act by herself?
91|She's the one whose life is in danger.
91|I guess I should've first rectified the misunderstanding that the target is Shinobu.
91|Shinobu as the target... she's not?
91|She was 400 years ago.
91|But this time, that's not the case.
91|Then, you obviously know who the current "phenomenon" is targeting as well?
91|Of course.
91|This time, the "darkness" is targeting that exhausted, sleeping girl.
91|In other words...
91|Hachikuji Mayoi-chan.
91|H-Hachikuji?
91|Is that so? I had thought, just maybe...
91|Is that right, Ononoki-chan?
91|I had heard about it a little bit from Gaen.
91|But either one was a possibility.
91|No, in truth, you were also a possibility, devil boy.
91|But I thought that Hachikuji-san was most likely.
91|What do you mean by that?
91|I'll answer that question.
91|That's why I came here in the first place.
91|The "darkness" is not an aberration.
91|An existence that isn't an aberration...
91|An anti-existence...
91|You can't defeat it.
91|You can't kill it either.
91|Nor eat it of course.
91|Unjust and absurd. That is what that anti-existence is. Something that doesn't exist.
91|Something that eradicates the existence of aberrations.
91|So, about the reason why someone gets targeted. That isn't unjust, nor is it absurd.
91|Strictly speaking, "that" only targets aberrations who have strayed from the path of the aberration.
91|Humans who stray from the path of humanity are eradicated from society, right?
91|Similarly, aberrations who stray from the path of the aberration are eradicated from the world.
91|By some supernatural power.
91|Hmm? You don't understand it well?
91|Then, as a specific example, think about what Shinobu-chan did 400 years ago.
91|Yes. That's right. Exactly.
91|Shinobu-chan, 400 years ago, played a god.
91|You want to say that Shinobu-chan didn't call herself a god...
91|...but it was just that the people around her mistook her for a god, right?
91|But still... Not trying to undo misunderstandings is the same as telling a lie.
91|If you become a god, no one can blame you for that.
91|But lies are no good.
91|What was not good wasn't that she became a god, but that she fooled others by pretending to be one.
91|That's why she became the target of judgment.
91|Now you see why Shinobu-chan was able to shake off the anti-existence, right?
91|She escaped to Antarctica with her huge leap, then acted as a vampire.
91|By creating a minion.
91|That revealed her lie that she was a god.
91|With just that, the reasons for the anti-existence to act disappeared.
91|In the end, Shinobu-chan faced judgment.
91|There is no reason for the current Shinobu-chan to be targeted. So she is safe.
91|Then who isn't safe at this moment? You can tell, right?
91|Hachikuji Mayoi, I'm talking about you.
91|You little liar.
91|First, stop pretending to be asleep!
91|Araragi-san!
91|It's all right. Calm down.
91|I don't know what's going on here, but for now, I'm on your side.
91|Okay...
91|What do you mean?
91|She... Hachikuji... What kind of lies are you saying she's telling?
91|The lie that Mayoi-chan is telling...
91|...is that she is right here, right now.
91|Mayoi-chan, you're supposed to be in the afterlife. Right?
91|Yet you still continue to be here.
91|That's the kind of lie you keep telling. A lie that you're still here.
91|Of course you'd get scolded. Even if it wasn't by an anti-existence.
91|Like, "Come on!"
91|A lie? That's not what I intended at all...
91|That's why I said if someone misunderstands you, it's already a lie, Hachikuji Mayoi-chan.
91|In other words, you are a ghost of a ghost right now.
91|Unfortunately, the world doesn't allow the existence of such a metastructure.
91|Such an existence will inevitably be swallowed up by the anti-existence.
91|A ghost of a ghost...
91|Hachikuji Mayoi is a ghost that died 11 years ago in a traffic accident.
91|Strictly speaking, she is the Lost Cow. An aberration of a snail.
91|But that was resolved thanks to Koyomin, his girlfriend, and the inexperienced Meme.
91|Mayoi-chan is no longer lost, but...
91|She still stands here.
91|If that isn't a lie, what is it?
91|As long as she is the Lost Cow, she has to continue making people lose their way.
91|But she is not doing so.
91|I've gone to Senjougahara's place with Hachikuji before.
91|I've never gotten lost while walking with Hachikuji.
91|Or rather, she often shows me the way.
91|That's why I thought Hachikuji was no longer the "Lost Cow" she once was.
91|That was how I saw Hachikuji.
91|That was how I perceived her.
91|Truly amazing deception.
91|But that's how things are now.
91|Wasn't that girl lying to you from the very beginning, Koyomin?
91|No. Hachikuji...
91|Hachikuji has never lied to me.
91|Even from the beginning... Not even once.
91|Araragi-san...
91|You're right. That's correct.
91|I was mistaken just now.
91|The person she lied to was herself.
91|Well, in either case...
91|...because she strayed from the path of the Lost Cow, Mayoi-chan will be punished and judged.
91|Punished and judged...
91|But... Impossible...
91|But you don't have evidence of any of that!
91|We don't know that the target is Hachikuji yet!
91|It's true that we don't have physical evidence, but aren't there a few pieces of circumstantial evidence?
91|The "darkness" didn't chase after you guys when Mayoi was unconscious, right?
91|Then, after that. After we escaped into the mountains, she was often tired and asleep...
91|You're saying it couldn't come after us?
91|You got it. Right now, you're in the middle of being lost.
91|Under these conditions, you could say that Mayoi-chan is fulfilling the true nature of the Lost Cow.
91|That is why the "darkness" is not appearing.
91|Conversely, Koyomin, if you guys returned to your town, to your house...
91|...Mayoi-chan would once again lose her true nature as an aberration.
91|So... So what are we supposed to do?
91|Are you telling Hachikuji to be a Lost Cow again?
91|As long as she continues to make people...
91|I don't want to do that.
91|I never want to do something like that ever again.
91|Hachikuji... But...
91|Thanks to you, Araragi-san, I didn't have to do stuff like that anymore.
91|I was able to go back to my house.
91|So I'm never going to do something like that again.
91|That I would never do that again... I decided to lie and say that.
91|Gaen-san. Then how do you defeat that "darkness"...
91|I'm telling you, it's not something you defeat.
91|That thing is sort of the materialization of the rules.
91|It's all right, Araragi-san.
91|Then, there is something we can do.
91|Something we can do?
91|We should do things like we always do.
91|We just need to handle this following the rules.
91|Following the rules? What do you mean by that, Hachikuji?
91|Be specific.
91|Specifically...
91|I just need to disappear.
91|Gaen-san simply went back.
91|She gave me her mobile number, saying she'll be waiting to hear from us.
91|Ononoki-chan, why didn't you go back with her?
91|No real reason other than how I'm lost together with you.
91|If I went home right now, I thought that might trigger the "darkness" again.
91|I see. You're kind.
91|That's right. Araragi-san, this problem doesn't just involve me.
91|Araragi-san, are you going to make me go through the same thing Shinobu-san went through 400 years ago?
91|Then let go of this hand.
91|That's an unfair way to put things.
91|I was supposed to go to the afterlife back on that day in May, on Mother's Day.
91|This is kind of like extra innings.
91|No, not extra innings. Maybe a bonus stage?
91|I didn't think that it would last forever.
91|I knew it would end some day.
91|Though the end was more abrupt than I'd imagined.
91|But still, this is how it should be.
91|I took a few too many liberties with my lies, like falling asleep at your place.
91|I simply had too much fun talking to you and...
91|...I delayed going over to the other side for all this time.
91|I wished for such fun times to continue forever, but...
91|No, wait a minute...
91|Don't try to wrap this all up. I'll think of something right now.
91|There must be something. Some way to turn this around...
91|There's not. There's no way to break through.
91|Anyway, wasn't the world rather nice to us through all this?
91|Normally, they wouldn't wait for months on end for an existence as nonsensical as the ghost of a ghost.
91|That's... But taking all the responsibility on yourself alone, Hachikuji...
91|...and because of it, saving everyone else...
91|What are you talking about, Araragi-san?
91|That's something that you've been doing for me all this time.
91|It's okay for you to do it, but you won't let others? That reasoning doesn't make sense.
91|Why? Why do you act like all this is normal?
91|It's true that it might look like that's what I've been doing.
91|But not once have I been completely fine with it.
91|I was always on the verge of tears... No, I've always fought while crying.
91|How can you just look like you have no worries or dissatisfaction...
91|I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.
91|But I'm not dissatisfied with anything. All of this has been fun.
91|From here on, I'll be looking out for you from up in the skies.
91|I'm telling you, don't say stuff like that!
91|Oh, I guess saying I'm going to disappear wasn't too good.
91|I'm merely going home, Araragi-san.
91|I won't be here anymore. But that doesn't mean that I was never here to begin with.
91|That's all one and the same. It's just a play on words.
91|That's enough of that, devil boy.
91|I can't tell which of you two is the child here.
91|The actual person involved is saying it's fine, so it's fine.
91|That's right, Araragi-san...
91|I'm saying that it's fine.
91|You really don't get it!
91|Stop talking about yourself and think about what I'm going through even for a little bit!
91|If that's what's going to happen, I'll stay lost with you forever!
91|Araragi-san...
91|Oh, that's right! That's a way to get through this! That solves everything!
91|In a mountain or village unknown to us... All I have to do is stay lost with you forever.
91|That way, you'll keep exhibiting your true powers as the Lost Cow, so there won't be any issues.
91|Araragi-san...
91|That's it. It's been decided.
91|That's what we'll do. I don't know how long I have left to live as a half-vampire...
91|...but I'm sure I can live at least a decade or two.
91|Araragi-san!
91|What are you talking about?
91|You're going to spend 20 years just with me? What are you going to do about Senjougahara-san?
91|And Hanekawa-san? You also have your little sisters to think about.
91|You can get Shinobu-san involved in this, but what about all the others?
91|Well, I'll think about each of them later.
91|Thinking about it won't do any good. You can't choose everyone.
91|Right, you can't be like an Italian gentleman.
91|Even an Italian gentleman would find this impossible.
91|It's all right, Araragi-san.
91|Like how we're together even when we're apart.
91|Like how memories in our hearts never fade.
91|Like how I'll always be at your side.
91|Like how our bond will last forever.
91|Like how I promise to return someday if you find yourself in a bind.
91|Please be satisfied with that.
91|I can't be satisfied with something so half-assed! Don't mock me!
91|It's all right now, Araragi-san.
91|These three months that I've spent having fun chats with you...
91|...have made up plenty for the 11 years I was lost on the streets by myself.
91|So it's all right now. Thank you very much.
91|Oh, that's right, Araragi-san. Let's do that thing one last time. You-know-what.
91|You-know-what?
91|The whole routine that starts with "I stuttered."
91|What? All those times were on purpose after all?
91|Of course they were! Nobody would ever stutter like that!
91|Right, Araragi-san?
91|Actually, we haven't done it once in this story arc.
91|Araragi-san, think of them as parting words from me. So now, please...
91|Fine.
91|Sorry. I stuttered...
91|I loved you, Araragi-san.
91|Ima mo zutto, sono koe wo oboeteru kara
91|I will always remember your voice, forever.
91|Ano hi hashitta michi ni ano hi miageta sora ni
91|I ran to you on this path. We admired the sky here.
91|Nidoto kaera nai toki wo kasaneteru
91|And here, we spent the time of our lives.
91|Kimi wa warau darou ka sukoshi okoru darou ne
91|Are you going to laugh, or are you going to be angy?
91|Konna akirame warui boku no koto wo
91|You'll probably be angry, but I just can't give up.
91|Nando demo
91|Time and time again,
91|Ukatsu ni negau kanousei wo seisa shite
91|I simply just want you.
91|itsumade mo
91|forever and ever
91|Mada amai uso ni damasarete takute
91|I want to be deceived by a lie.
91|Dakara douka, semete nante omou kokoro wa
91|My feeling are so chaotic,
91|Ichiji teki na kanshou datte yuruseba ii
91|so please forgive me.
91|Dakara sou sa, kimi ga yatto zetsubou no saki de
91|I want you to know that in the past,
91|Fureta hibi ni itsuwari nante nai to
91|the despair you found in me
91|Itte ageyou
91|was real.
91|Wasurenai de
91|Don't forget that.
91|And so, what happened after that?
91|What's the epilogue or punch line for this episode?
91|Nothing really happened.
91|Hachikuji happily made it into the afterlife, and Ononoki-chan and I came back to this town.
91|And as promised, I helped with Gaen-san's job.
91|That job was a much worse case...
91|I see... That was quite an ordeal. I do sympathize.
91|I still think to this day... That there was some other way to go about it.
91|Well, you were just barely safe.
91|It was the most sensible choice,
91|going to the afterlife rather than being swallowed up by the "darkness."
91|Well, that was a good story for me to hear. Thank you very much, Araragi-senpai.
91|No, being able to share it took a load off my shoulders.
91|No, no, at least let me give you my thanks.
91|Now, I have a bit of work to do, so I'll excuse myself for today.
91|Hey, Ougi-chan, what's the work you have to do?
91|It's ordinary work.
91|Figuratively speaking...
91|...it's a very commonplace job, like the overwhelming darkness that takes up most of the universe.
91|Correct the mistaken. End what needs to be ended.
91|If I had to describe it, I'd say it's a job that punishes the liars.
91|You'll know in due time, so please rest assured.
91|I just might end up asking for your powers to aid me someday, Araragi-senpai.
91|See you!
91|It feels like everyone just leaves me here and disappears.
91|I feel like I'm being left behind.
91|Hey, you.
91|I think you know this already, but that girl is probably "something."
91|Yeah, true. She may be.
91|What, you already knew?
91|No, there are so many things I don't know about. I wish I could know about everything.
91|For now, I'm keeping it a secret that Hachikuji is no longer here.
91|Let's see how telling just Ougi-chan affects things.
91|Oh, was blabbing off to her part of your war plan?
91|Or did you just come up with it?
91|So, for how long?
91|No clue. Until there's some sort of result from it.
91|I need to tell Ononoki-chan to keep quiet as well.
91|Someone like Hanekawa might easily see through it...
91|...but let's at least try to pretend as if Hachikuji is still around here in this town.
91|Isn't that regretful attachment?
91|If you keep telling lies like that, you'll be swallowed up by the "darkness."
91|That won't happen.
91|Come to think of it, on that day four months ago...
91|...I never used those words with respect to my farewell to Hachikuji.
91|I'm pretty dumb to realize that just now.
91|Goodbye, Hachikuji Mayoi.
91|I'm happy that I was able to meet you.

91|Do you know what an "anamgra" is?
91|I know, I know, I...!?
91|Eh? This is goodbye?
91|Eh, Tsukihi-chan, what's wrong with you, saying something out of Genji Monogatari chapter 44?
91|What's an "anamgra"? Is it an old word? Or some kind of mole?
91|Oh, so you don't know? It's a word game where you swap letters around to create different words!
91|Sputter
91|Crackle
91|Ah! She passed away!
91|That's "anagram"...
91|Indeed, I swapped some letters so that "anagram" would become "anamgra". That was but an example!
91|That's where you're wrong!
91|Then, here is another example.
91|"Ranra Kagiare": what do you get if you put back the letters in their right place? "Araragi Karen"!
91|Nii-chan is missing at such a crucial moment!
91|Wonderful, to think "Ranra Kagiare" could become "Araragi Karen"! Only, what does "Ranra Kagiare" mean...

92|If a stranger saw me right now,
92|I wonder what they'd think.
92|I'm hiding under the floor of a shrine.
92|They'd probably think I was a thief.
92|Maybe.
92|But pretty much every human is a thief, more or less.
92|The only thing the lot of you have on your minds is to steal what others have.
92|Is that so?
92|It is.
92|Didn't you come to realize that more than anyone— more than anyone else in the world—these past few days?
92|Well ?
92|But I think there's a lot of people who aren't like that.
92|It's more like there are times when people aren't like that.
92|You're just talking about how they behave at certain points in time.
92|Good people turn evil at the drop of a hat,
92|and the opposite also holds true.
92|The people you've faced so far have all been like that.

92|Apparently Koyomi is a vampire.
92|However, from what I can see, the regenerative abilities he's supposed to have as a vampire
92|don't seem to be working at all.
92|Whoa. How could you say that?
92|You're the one who fucked this vampire guy up so badly.
92|Venom affects vampires too.
92|The fangs you stuck in him haven't been taken out. They're still piercing his body.

92|Oh, really?
92|Yeah, that's right.
92|It was me.
92|It was my doing.
92|There's no room for excuses.
92|There were no extenuating circumstances.
92|It was all my fault.
92|Then I'd better fight him.
92|Looks like she's completely surrendered her body and soul to the oddity.
92|No.
92|I suppose I should say she has become an oddity here.
92|Now I know why that Hawaiian shirt brat seemed so awfully concerned about the girl with the bangs.
92|Wait.
92|I guess now she's the girl with the fangs.
92|Hey, my master.
92|Do not hesitate.
92|She is no longer your sisters' friend or your innocent little junior—
92|just a hopelessly wicked and evil oddity.
92|Just a snake.
92|I know that.
92|She's an enemy to me and food for you.

92|Wait, that's too far back, isn't it?
92|Let's limit it to experiences that I can narrate.
92|In other words, let's only go back as far as the day I met the serpent.
92|31st of October
92|The date was October 31st.
92|A Tuesday.
92|Mornings always make me feel so melancholic.
92|To be more precise, the road to school always makes me feel melancholic.
92|That has never been untrue.
92|Not since that day.
92|Not since what happened in June.
92|Empty Parking Spots
92|Whoa, look ou—

92|A-Are you okay?
92|I'm fine!
92|Are you hurt, Sengoku?
92|What's wrong, Sengoku?
92|I thought I evaded you there,
92|but did I, on the contrary, take out a strand of your hair or something?
92|I apologize if so,
92|Sengoku.
92|H-How?
92|My name... How?
92|How do you know my name?
92|Sense of Faux-Pas
92|Scene no. 184
92|Oh, right.
92|Damn, I hadn't met you yet!
92|Jeez, I got the order all wrong.
92|This is all because Hachikuji's nowhere to be found.
92|She's just too unpredictable.
92|Such a pain.
92|What should I do?
92|Nice to meet you, my lovely young lady.
92|I'm Oshino Ougi.
92|Sense of Improvisation
92|Scene no. 189
92|Oshino?
92|Er...
92|How do I get out of this situation?
92|Should I mention Araragi to her or something?
92|Well, uh...
92|Sengoku,
92|I'd heard about you from Araragi.
92|You can tell by looking at this uniform, right?
92|I'm his junior at school,
92|and also Kanbaru's.
92|Junior, not Jr.
92|I'm a first-year at Naoetsu High School.
92|Not working, huh?
92|I did screw up right from the start.
92|Well, whatever.
92|The stuff with Sengoku is basically a side story.
92|Things probably won't end up like they did with Hanekawa Tsubasa.
92|Er...
92|I'm Oshino Meme's niece.
92|My uncle has also told me about you.
92|He called you a victim.
92|That was probably in part due to Kaiki's involvement,
92|but it's quite rare to see a genuine victim when it comes to oddities.
92|But you know what, Sengoku? People can't always be the victim.
92|It's just that sometimes they're the victim, and sometimes they're the aggressor.
92|Or do you still consider yourself the victim?
92|No reaction, huh?
92|Maybe you could actually stay the victim if you keep your head down and say nothing,
92|but I don't know if that's gonna work this time around.
92|This might be the exception to the rule, you know?
92|Victims sure have it easy.
92|Everyone's nice to you out of pity.
92|There are also cases where people blame the victim,
92|but they're basically saying that the aggressors are victims too.
92|Or maybe, and I believe my uncle hated this mindset,
92|that there are only victims in this world.
92|Lilac
92|Unnumbered Scene
92|And if you turn that on its head,
92|maybe you weren't a genuine victim either.
92|The story this time might make that clear.
92|S-Story?
92|Yeah.
92|Wait, don't tell me...
92|You don't think you're living an everyday life that's not at all worth telling as a story, do you?

92|Unnumbered Scene
92|I didn't think we were talking for long, but for some strange reason,
92|quite some time had passed without my realizing it.
92|How should I put this?
92|It was like my time had been stolen from me.
92|Scene no. 230
92|Anyway, I reached my school.
92|I had arrived!
92|The accident Ougi and I got into hadn't made me late for school.
92|Nanahyakuichi Public Middle School / Entrance

92|Scene no. 236
92|Red
92|Unnumbered Scene
92|Was that just my imagination?
92|Scene no. 249
92|Yeah.
92|That's what life in Class 2-2 was like at the time.
92|We were basically leading a melancholic school life.
92|Scene no. 253
92|If you asked me who was to blame,
92|then I'd say no one in particular.
92|Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who
92|But if people had to choose one person to blame for all of it in an anonymous poll,
92|I'm sure they'd unanimously choose that con artist, Kaiki Deishuu.
92|Scene no. 255
92|He's a shoo-in!
92|Well, I'm talking here like I know the guy,
92|but I've never met him.
92|Scene no. 256
92|It's just that... he's more than an acquaintance.
92|If you leave out my family,
92|Scene no. 257
92|To me, he's a key figure—a VIP.
92|Koyomi,
92|Scene no. 257
92|and Tsukihi,
92|Scene no. 257
92|then he's the one
92|Scene no. 257
92|who left the biggest impression
92|Scene no. 257
92|in my life.
92|Scene no. 257
92|Because it's due to him that my life went off-track,
92|got derailed, and came crashing down.
92|Scene no. 258
92|Oh, could this be what they call "playing the victim"?
92|Not good!
92|I take it back.
92|I can't stomach goddamn victim mentalities
92|Scene no. 259
92|It was my surroundings that went off-track,
92|got derailed, and came crashing down.
92|Not me.
92|Maybe
92|Scene no. 261
92|I'm getting sidetracked here a little,
92|Scene no. 262
92|Back in June,
92|but I think this should be elaborated upon,
92|Scene no. 262
92|Kaiki targeted the middle schoolers in this town.
92|so allow me to reminisce.
92|Scene no. 262
92|I will keep it brief.
92|Scene no. 262
92|He scammed an unspecified large number of middle schoolers by selling them fake charms.
92|Frankly speaking, it wasn't a very large sum of money.
92|Kaiki's style was all about focusing on quick, small profits.
92|Of course, some kids went too far,
92|What Happened
92|Scene no. 262
92|which became an issue that called the Fire Sisters into action.
92|A ra ra gi
92|What Happened Before
92|Scene no. 262
92|But looking back on it a few months later,
92|What Happened After
92|Scene no. 262
92|the real issue ended up being the stuff dealing with mere pocket change—
92|the stuff no one viewed as a big deal:
92|the vast majority of the scams.
92|Those of my classmates who couldn't perform the ritual
92|Scene no. 263
92|Basically, who in our class liked whom,
92|who hated whom,
92|how someone felt about someone else,
92|and what someone wanted to do with someone else...
92|The kind of stuff that was more than just personal information—
92|every bit of "their feelings towards everyone else" had been exposed.
92|When I found out
92|Scene no. 266
92|Well, you can pretty much figure out what happened afterwards, right?
92|what they really thought of me
92|Scene no. 266
92|even though I felt
92|Scene no. 266
92|we were getting along——
92|Scene no. 266
92|And—I'm sure this is plainly coincidental—
92|for some reason, the charms that Kaiki was selling
92|ended up being extremely popular in my class.
92|Uneventful.
92|Scene no. 270
92|A class where nothing happens.
92|Scene no. 272
92|A class where everyone pretends to sleep.
92|Scene no. 274
92|The result:
92|Our current melancholic school life.
92|A strained and gloomy atmosphere which makes us unable to speak our minds.
92|A class that's peaceful only on the surface.
92|Scene no. 288
92|A snake?
92|The same snake from back then?
92|A delicate response
92|Scene no. 290
92|No, not that one. A different snake.
92|I can't talk properly.
92|Scene no. 291
92|Does it seem like there's no adverse effects right now?
92|Or is it constricting your body like before?
92|No, nothing like that.
92|Any causes you can think of?
92|Causes?
92|Y'know, like what started making you see frequent illusions of a white snake.
92|Or like, any reasons you might know of.
92|Reasons...
92|I think on it.
92|Scene no. 298
92|Nothing comes to mind.
92|Scene no. 299
92|I don't know of any.
92|They say oddities don't show up without a suitable reason,
92|but well, you're a bit of an exception to the rule.
92|It was the same last time too.

92|Wait for Shinobu to wake up, that is.
92|She's been maintaining a normal lifestyle recently.
92|She didn't help with the Constrictor Snake,
92|but we need her help now.
92|Er,
92|Sh-Shinobu eats oddities, right?
92|Will she eat the white snake I saw, then?
92|Cooking
92|Childcare
92|If she has to.
92|But it's not like she can solve all our problems by eating them,
92|so I'd say the knowledge she possesses is what's more important.
92|The expertise she inherited from Oshino.
92|Tonight, then.
92|Yeah, go home and wait.
92|I'll call you.
92|Shinobu usually wakes up by about 10 PM, so expect me to call you sometime around then.
92|Okay, got it.
92|Talk to you at 10, then.

92|Seriously though, what the hell's going on?
92|How strange.
92|Oddities don't show up without a suitable reason.
92|But yet again, I have no idea what would cause this.
92|You can't seriously be thinking that.
92|Well ?
92|You don't know of any reasons?
92|How awful.
92|Pipsqueaks with no self-awareness like you are so damn troublesome.
92|Holy crap,
92|you have no idea what you're trampling on to live.
92|Wh-Who are you?
92|Come see me at the Shrine of the Polar Snake, Nadeko.
92|Then I'll tell you what you're trampling on to live.
92|What's going on? There are auditory hallucinations too now.

92|Was it around this many, Nadeko?
92|The number of snakes you killed, I mean.
92|Slaughter.
92|Scene no. 401
92|Mutilation.
92|Scene no. 401
92|Crucified—Snakes.
92|Scene no. 401
92|You did go this far, right?
92|Maybe I could have cast down my eyes
92|Scene no. 406
92|and stood there quietly
92|Scene no. 408
92|to stay a victim—
92|Scene no. 410

92|Scene no. 412

92|If you want to atone for this sin,
92|Purity in Spirit
92|I'll graciously give you the chance to.
92|Take off your blinders and look this way.
92|This way?
92|You looked this way.
92|You saw this serpent.
92|That means you're my comrade now.
92|You're my partner.
92|You're going to have to atone for your sins, Nadeko.

92|Scene no. 433
92|That's not what I...
92|Scene no. 434
92|Maybe I shouldn't have been so roundabout as to call it atonement.
92|It's been a while since I last spoke to a human, so I can't figure out the right balance.
92|My bad.
92|I'm sorry.
92|It's not a big deal. I just have a favor to ask of you.
92|If you regret killing so many of my comrades even a little bit,
92|could you do me a small favor?
92|A favor?
92|Oh, would it be better if I put it this way instead?
92|Help me, Nadeko.
92|I thought it was an impossible request.
92|But I felt it was even more impossible to refuse.
92|Pink
92|Unnumbered Scene
92|O-Okay.
92|That's what I said.
92|While covering my eyes and ears,
92|this is what I said.
92|J-Just a small one, okay?
92|But thinking back on it,
92|it was already clear by this time how this story was going to end.
92|Because, even if I'd known what the serpent was trying to make me do,
92|even if I'd known what he was trying to do to me,
92|and even if I'd known the truth and reality of it all,
92|I still would have agreed.
92|My destiny wouldn't have changed.
92|So a story with a different ending was nothing but a pipe dream,
92|and the future in which Koyomi and I would attempt to kill each other
92|was getting closer by the second.
92|Don't worry, I'll always remember your voice
92|Here's the path where I ran toward you
92|This is the sky I admired
92|Here we spend the time of our life
92|Will you laugh?
92|Will you be angry?
92|I just can't give up, and you're probably going to be angry with me
92|Countless times
92|I consider the possibility of just wanting you
92|(forevermore)
92|I still want a lie to deceive me
92|Come on, forgive me,
92|because my feelings are so chaotic
92|Yeah, I want you to know
92|that the life you found past despair is real
92|Don't forget that

92|Quiz!
92|You mix 300L each of a 5% and 10% saline solution and add 400L of 20% saline solution to those 600L from earlier.
92|I had this weird hairstyle when I woke up today.
92|Whoa...!
92|If you drank half of this, how many liters of what salinity would that make?
92|Wow, this is a pretty serious quiz.
92|500L of 12.5% salt content, right?
92|Oh, no! Why'd Bro have to show up now, of all times?!
92|I'd rather die than be seen like this.
92|The correct answer is...
92|You can't drink half of it!
92|I just want to punch you.
92|Next question. You mix 200L of a 25% saline solution with 100L of a 25% saline solution and heat the mixture
92|until all except one-half of one-half has evaporated. How many liters of what saline content are left?
92|Welcome

93|Really?
93|Of course. You felt that more deeply than anyone else in this world the past few days, Nadeko-chan, no?
93|But, I think a lot of people aren't like that.
93|If you're gonna say so, you should probably say "There are many times they aren't like that."
93|It just depends on who they are at what time.
93|Good people can easily become bad, and bad people can easily become good.

93|The fangs you pierced him with haven't been pulled out; they're still embedded in him.
93|White Scene
93|Animation Number 'none'
93|Ah, that's how it was...
93|Of course.
93|That's how it was.
93|It was me. It was my fault.
93|With no room for excuses.
93|With no room for extenuating circumstances.
93|It was my fault
93|Then... I have to fight properly.
93|Hmph.
93|Looks like she's completely fallen to being an aberration, body and soul.
93|No. In this case, should I rather say that she's ascended to being an aberration?
93|I finally understand why Hawaiian-shirt guy was so worried about this bangs-girl.
93|No, she's not bangs-girl. She's snake-hair girl now.
93|Hey, you.
93|Don't hesitate. This girl is no longer your sister's friend, nor an innocent underclassman.
93|She's an evil, fiendish, hopeless aberration.
93|Nothing more than a lone snake.
93|I already know that.
93|She's my enemy—and your meal.
93|Go ahead and eat her, Shinobu.
93|I'm jealous.
93|Actually, I wanted to be in that position.
93|I don't understand.
93|Animation Number 103
93|I wanted to be at Koyomi-oniichan's side.
93|I don't understand.
93|Animation Number 105
93|I wanted to be his partner.
93|I don't understand——
93|Animation Number 107
93|But why is Nadeko...
93|What am I?
93|Animation Number 109
93|Why am I...
93|Why?
93|Animation Number 111
93|Why have I become Koyomi-oniichan's enemy?
93|I hate you, Koyomi-oniichan!
93|Yee-haw! Hey now, you finally did it, Nadeko-chan.
93|The heart of the man I loved
93|Animation Number 125
93|Now, now, really...
93|I'm sorry, it's just so funny

93|Font used in the video: HGP Mincho B
93|The story traces back a thousand years.
93|Am I tracing it back too far? I figured.
93|I'll just trace it back to the day which I can speak about from my own experience.
93|In other words, the day that I met Kuchinawa-san.
93|31st of October
93|That day was October 31st. A Tuesday.
93|I'm always "depressed" in the morning.
93|To be more descriptive, I'm always "depressed" on my way to school.
93|There is no path to school that doesn't make me "depressed."
93|Ever since that day.
93|Ever since June.
93|Empty Parking Spots
93|Whoa, look...
93|Look...
93|...out!
93|Animation Number 168
93|A-Are you all right?
93|I'm fine!
93|You're not hurt, are you, Sengoku-chan?
93|What's wrong, Sengoku-chan? I thought I dodged pretty well there.
93|But did I graze a hair or something, contrary to my expectations?
93|If so, I'm sorry, so sorry, Sengoku-chan.
93|W-Why...
93|W-Why do you know...
93|Why do you know... my name?
93|Sense of Faux-Pas
93|Animation Number 184
93|Oh... right!
93|Oops, I forgot that Sengoku-chan and I aren't acquainted yet.
93|Oh, geez, I totally did this out of order.
93|This is all because Hachikuji-chan is quite hard to find.
93|That girl is all too irregular. What a nuisance.
93|Oh, what should I do...
93|Nice to meet you, cute little lady! My name is Oshino Ougi.
93|Sense of Improvisation
93|Animation Number 189
93|Oshino?
93|Let's see, how should I laugh this off...
93|For now, with this girl, just mentioning Araragi-senpai's name should do the trick, right?
93|Then, well... Sengoku-chan, I've heard about you from Araragi-senpai.
93|See, can't you tell from the uniform? I'm Araragi-senpai's underclassman.
93|I'm also Kanbaru-san's underclassman.
93|Not an under class manager, I'm an underclassman. I'm a first-year at Naoetsu High School.
93|Oh, no good. I totally screwed up from the outset.
93|Oh well. The case about Sengoku-chan is basically a side story anyway.
93|It shouldn't end up like Tsubasa-senpai staying at the Hanekawas' house.
93|Let's see...
93|I'm Oshino Meme's niece.
93|I heard about you from my uncle as well. I heard you were a victim.
93|I'm sure it was because Kaiki-san was involved...
93|...but boy oh boy, it's rare to see someone who is purely the victim of an aberration.
93|However,
93|people can't be victims forever, Sengoku-chan.
93|People just have times when they're victims, and times when they're the wrongdoers.
93|Or are you still thinking of yourself... as a victim?
93|No response, huh?
93|Well, if you keep looking down and staying quiet like that, then yes, maybe you'll be able to remain the victim.
93|But will it go well this time around?
93|This time may just be the exception.
93|It's easy to be the victim. Everyone sympathizes with you and is all nice to you.
93|There is the phrase "thinking little of victims," but that's just merely saying "wrongdoers are victims too."
93|My uncle, though, I think he hated that train of thought.
93|Well, it just may be that oftentimes the world only has victims.
93|Lilac Scene
93|Animation Number 'none'
93|In other words, flip that again, and maybe you weren't purely a victim from the beginning, Sengoku.
93|And in this story, that may be just beginning to surface.
93|S-Story?
93|Yeah.
93|Oh, wait, Sengoku-chan, you're not saying you think
93|you're living a life that has no prospect of becoming an actual story, are you?
93|Black Scene
93|Animation Number 'none'
93|See ya!
93|Huh?
93|Black Scene
93|Animation Number 'none'
93|For some strange reason, I didn't think I was chatting for that long...
93|...but then I realized what time it was, and a lot of time had passed.
93|How to put it...
93|It was as if time was stolen from me.
93|Anyway, I got to school. My arrival.
93|The accident with Ougi-san hadn't made me late.
93|Coiling around my hand, possessing me.
93|Animation Number 236
93|Red Scene
93|Animation Number 'none'
93|Was that just me?
93|Yes, that's right. This was the current state of class 2-2.
93|In other words, a "depressing" school life.
93|Animation Number 253
93|If you asked whose fault it was, it wasn't really anyone's fault.
93|Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who
93|If we were to have an anonymous vote where we wrote the name of one person that caused all this...
93|I think it would be unanimous. That con artist Kaiki Deishu-san.
93|He's a safe bet!
93|Animation Number 255
93|Oh no, I talk about him as if we've met, but I've never met him.
93|Animation Number 256
93|However, we're more than simple acquaintances.
93|As for how we've interacted, he's super-important.
93|If you leave out my family,
93|Animation Number 257
93|Koyomi-oniichan
93|Animation Number 257
93|and Tsukihi-chan,
93|Animation Number 257
93|You could say he's a VIP,
93|then he's the one
93|Animation Number 257
93|who left the biggest impression
93|Animation Number 257
93|in my life.
93|Animation Number 257
93|since my life deviated greatly because of him.
93|It went off it's path, and then crumbled apart.
93|Oh, perhaps saying it like this makes me sound like the victim?
93|That's not good. I'll correct myself.
93|I can't stomach these victim mentalities
93|Animation Number 259
93|It's the environment around me that deviated. What deviated and crumbled was...
93|...the environment around me. It wasn't me.
93|Maybe
93|Animation Number 261
93|It was back in June.
93|Kaiki-san targeted every junior high student in town.
93|It was a fraud scheme to sell fake magic charms to all those students.
93|The sum involved was clearly not that large a figure.
93|It was the Kaiki-style business of small profits, quick returns.
93|A few kids splurged, and it became an issue.
93|What Happened
93|Animation Number 262
93|That's why the Fire Sisters went on the move.
93|A ra ra gi
93|But after some time had passed...
93|the real issue was that the majority of the frauds were so inexpensive people could pay with their allowances.
93|Those of my classmates who couldn't perform the ritual
93|Animation Number 263
93|Basically, within the class...
93|"Who likes who."
93|"Who hates who."
93|"What someone thinks of someone else."
93|"What someone wants to do with someone else."
93|...things like that; you could say "how everyone feels," something even worse than personal information,
93|had all "come out in the open."
93|I'm sure you have an idea what happens after such a thing.
93|When I found out
93|Animation Number 266
93|what they really thought of me
93|Animation Number 266
93|even though I felt
93|Animation Number 266
93|we were getting along——
93|Animation Number 266
93|And it is just a commonplace coincidence...
93|...but for some reason, the "magic charms" Kaiki-san sold were very popular amongst my classmates.
93|Uneventful.
93|Animation Number 270
93|A class where nothing happens.
93|Animation Number 272
93|The result of that is the "depressing" school life I have now.
93|Very strained. Very gloomy.
93|Nobody can talk from their heart. A class that is only superficially peaceful.
93|Animation Number 288
93|A snake?
93|A snake, huh? The same as last time?
93|A delicate response
93|Animation Number 290
93|No, that's not it. It's different.
93|I can't talk properly.
93|Animation Number 291
93|For now, there hasn't been any actual harm, right?
93|Nothing like last time when it started constricting your body, right?
93|N-Nope.
93|Can you think of any causes?
93|A cause?
93|For hallucinations of white snakes to show up again and again around you...
93|Can you think of anything familiar that started it?
93|Familiar...
93|I think on it.
93|Animation Number 298
93|Nothing comes to mind.
93|Animation Number 299
93|None at all...
93|Hmm...
93|They say aberrations have reasons that are befitting.
93|Well, your case is slightly different. It was different last time too.
93|For now, if it's not something urgent, let's wait until this evening.
93|Take telephone receiver
93|Press button
93|Dial a number
93|Neither coin nor card is needed
93|Evening?
93|We should wait for Shinobu to wake up.
93|Philosophy
93|World History
93|She's pretty much got a regular body clock lately.
93|Shinobu didn't help us during the Jagirinawa incident...
93|...but there's no way I can do without her help now.
93|Um, Shinobu... Shinobu-san eats aberrations, right?
93|Then will she eat the white snake that I saw?
93|Cooking
93|Childcare
93|Depends on the situation, but it's not like eating anything and everything is always the best course.
93|So it's more about what she knows. Specialized information she inherited from old man Oshino.
93|Then... this evening?
93|Yeah. Go home and wait for us. I'll call you.
93|Let's see, Shinobu usually wakes up around 10 p.m., so plan on it being around then.
93|Okay, got it. Then, at 10 p.m.
93|I'll look forward to it.
93|Huh?
93|Oh,
93|Animation Number 329
93|damn.

93|I'm sorry.
93|in the hopes that this will solve it——
93|Animation Number 336
93|I'm sorry, Koyomi-oniichan.
93|If apologizing fixed anything,
93|Animation Number 337
93|No...
93|nobody would need the police.
93|Animation Number 339
93|It's not something to apologize for...
93|That's what they say.
93|Animation Number 341
93|I'm all right. I'm fine.
93|That expression
93|Animation Number 342
93|I-In any case, this evening. W-Well...

93|Oh, come to think of it, I forgot to ask Koyomi-oniichan about Ougi-san.
93|As I remember that for no coherent reason...
93|Animation Number 360
93|But... What is this phenomenon really?
93|It's strange.
93|Aberrations have reasons that are befitting.
93|But this time, like the last, I can't think of anything that could be the reason.
93|Come now, you can't be serious, Nadeko-chan, no?
93|You can't think of anything that could be the reason? That's taking things too far.
93|Brats with no self-awareness like you are the most troublesome.
93|Really... You don't know what you're stomping on to live at all.
93|W-Who is it?
93|Come over to North Shirahebi Shrine, Nadeko-chan.
93|I'll teach you right there. About what you've been stomping on to keep living...
93|What's going on? There are auditory hallucinations too now.
93|Animation Number 373
93|There is no such thing as a victim. Only wrongdoers exist in this world.
93|Animation Number 372
93|Each and every person is full of misunderstandings.
93|You're not surprised.
93|As if it were obvious... As if you knew all along... Not even one scream...
93|Right.
93|Because...
93|The one who created this nightmarish scene from hell...
93|Black Scene
93|Animation Number 'none'
93|...is none other than...
93|Black Scene

93|....yourself.

93|Nadeko-chan.
93|I-I...
93|I didn't go this far...
93|Right. This is...
93|...just an illusion.
93|Let's see, was it about this many?
93|How many you killed off, Nadeko.
93|Slaughter.
93|Animation Number 401
93|Mutilation.
93|Animation Number 401
93|You did go this far, right?
93|Maybe I could have cast down my eyes
93|Animation Number 406
93|and stood there quietly
93|Animation Number 408
93|to stay a victim——
93|Animation Number 410
93|I wonder if that would have worked out.
93|Animation Number 412
93|S-Snake...
93|If you want to atone for this sin, I'll give you the opportunity.
93|Take off that blindfold and look over here.
93|Over here?
93|You looked over here. You looked at me, Kuchinawa.
93|In other words, you are now one of my compatriots. In other words, my partner.
93|I'll have you atone, all right...
93|...Nadeko-chan.
93|W-What? S-Should I apologize? Do you want me to apologize?
93|W-What do you mean by atone? I... I...
93|What should I do?
93|"What should I do," huh?
93|Red Scene
93|Animation Number 'none'
93|Normally, in times like this, people ask for forgiveness.
93|The fact that you didn't say "please forgive me" is really something!
93|I-I'm not that...
93|Or maybe I shouldn't have used a roundabout word like "atone."
93|It's been a while since I last spoke with a human, so I don't know how to set limits.
93|Bad, bad... That was my bad, no?
93|Well, I just have a favor to ask of you.
93|If you feel any guilt about the fact that you killed off a dozen or so of my compatriots...
93|I want you to listen, just for a little bit, to the favors I ask of you.
93|Favors...
93|Or do you prefer me to put it like this, Nadeko-chan...
93|Please save me, Nadeko-chan.
93|I thought he was asking for the impossible. But declining was even more impossible.
93|A-All right.
93|I'll say it. Ears plugged, eyes downcast... I'll say it.
93|J-Just for a little bit.
93|But come to think of it, the ending to this story was already determined back then.
93|Even if I knew what Kuchinawa-san wanted me to do back then...
93|Even if I knew what Kuchinawa-san wanted to do to me.
93|Even if I knew the truth and the facts.
93|I'm sure I would've nodded yes in the same way.
93|So I think destiny would not have changed.
93|A story as such is nothing but a story.
93|And the future where I fight Koyomi-oniichan to the death is inching ever closer.
93|Ima mo zutto, sono koe wo oboeteru kara
93|I will always remember your voice, forever.

93|Preview Quiz!
93|Quiz!
93|If you mix 300L of a 5% saline solution with 300L of a 10% saline solution, you get 600L total.
93|When I woke up this morning, my hair was like this...
93|Ew!
93|Add to that 400L of a 20% saline solution then drink half of it, what volume at what concentration do you end up with?
93|What a serious quiz. You get 500L at 12.5% concentration, right?
93|Ah! Our brother always shows up at the worst times!
93|If anyone sees me like this, I'll die!
93|The right answer was: you drank only half of it!
93|I'm gonna hit you.
93|Now, if you mix 100L of a 25% saline solution with 200L of a 25% saline solution,
93|then let it evaporate until there is a quarter left, what volume at what concentration remains?
93|I got an idea...
93|Divination
93|Welcome.
93|Since salt doesn't evaporate, you get 75L of a 100% saline solution.
93|That would be only salt.

94|and it actually was some kind of oddity,
94|make sure you call me.
94|O-Okay, I got it.
94|Th-Tha—
94|Thanks, Koyomi.
94|To be honest, I'd love to stay on the phone longer...

94|Wow, you lied to your beloved Koyomi.
94|You okay with that?
94|Red
94|Unnumbered Scene
94|D-Don't be too loud.
94|There's no need to sneak around, you know.
94|You're the only one who can hear me.
94|I'm well aware.
94|Scene no. 12
94|If you can be that small,
94|then why'd you show up looking so huge that you swallowed up the entire shrine?
94|I was just setting the stage.
94|Making my appearance seem grand.
94|There'd be no point to an oddity if it didn't shock the living daylights outta humans.
94|Serpent...
94|Are you the person—er, snake enshrined over there?
94|Precisely—
94|Well, I can't say that, exactly.
94|That shrine has long since lost all religious value.
94|Now it's just a hangout for undesirable elements.
94|No, it might be more accurate to call it a garbage dump.
94|Dear God...
94|Scene no. 19
94|Er...
94|Then, Serpent...
94|How can I make up...
94|Scene no. 19
94|What should I do?
94|I mean, what would you like of me?
94|Scene no. 19
94|What I want you to do is find something for me.
94|I want you to find my corpse.
94|Strangely... No.

94|Who cares about reasons, explanations?
94|I just know that it's fate
94|If you will not fall in love with me too,
94|then nothing will ever change
94|I understood nothing,
94|but closed my eyes
94|and, looking so very cute, asked the stars for help
94|I don't need a world
94|which will not do my bidding
94|There's only one thing I want
94|Everything, everything, everything, everything

94|1st of November

94|The next morning, I headed to school like always.
94|Yes, it didn't matter if I was seeing things.
94|I still had to go to school.
94|That's what makes a middle schooler.
94|I woke up, changed into my uniform, and walked down the path to school.
94|The usual school-going scene
94|Scene no. 28
94|The perfect middle school life.
94|The white scrunchie on my wrist made this a morning unlike any other, though.
94|I'm lucky that
94|Scene no. 34
94|Say, Serpent.
94|it pretty well
94|Scene no. 34
94|fits my
94|Scene no. 34
94|usual style.
94|Scene no. 34
94|Can't you make yourself invisible to everyone except me?
94|I can, but I don't want to waste any more energy than I have already.
94|Relax.
94|No one else can hear me,
94|and I'll pretend to be just an accessory while you're at school.
94|Thus I arrived at the school.
94|Scene no. 36
94|Hey! Hey, Nadeko!
94|Scene no. 38
94|Why do you change your shoes?
94|Why is there a need to do that?
94|I'm not really sure.
94|I've never thought about it,
94|but I'm sure it's to keep the school interiors clean.
94|Scene no. 42
94|Uh, please don't talk, okay?
94|I know, I know.
94|You don't need to remind me.
94|I'm not the talkative type to begin with.
94|Just like you.
94|Nanahyakuichi Public Middle School / Classroom
94|Scene no. 44
94|School, eh?
94|That shrine used to conduct a similar kind of educational activity too.
94|Man, things are so unnaturally in order here. It's creeping me out.
94|Wait.
94|Maybe it's unique to this class.
94|Like, you guys act so reserved with each other. There's so much tension in the air.
94|I left the classroom. I crossed the corridor and climbed the stairs.
94|Scene no. 53
94|Hey, Serpent.
94|I went all the way to the "off limits" door to the roof on the top floor.
94|Scene no. 53
94|What?
94|Shut up.
94|You see, I'm a meek, quiet, and shy girl.
94|The type of kid people can't really place, huh?
94|Yeah.
94|I'm the type of girl people can't really place.
94|I start talking to my wrist.
94|Scene no. 56
94|That's me, all right.
94|It's me.
94|Scene no. 56
94|What do you think my classmates would think if they saw a girl like me talking to her own wrist?
94|What would they think?
94|They'd think I was pathetic.
94|Really?
94|I get the feeling it wouldn't make much of a difference.
94|So your position would change a little. Ultimately, what difference would that make?
94|Black
94|Unnumbered Scene
94|A-Anyway, Serpent...
94|Hmm?
94|Wait a sec, Nadeko.
94|Have you always run away from uncomfortable topics?
94|By using "Anyway..."
94|Scene no. 64
94|and "That aside..."
94|Scene no. 64
94|Is that how you've been living your life? Without ever holding a proper conversation?
94|You don't agree with what I said, but you neither object to it nor take it into consideration.
94|You simply sweep it under the rug.
94|Is that your survival technique?
94|Anyway...
94|My survival technique.
94|Scene no. 68
94|It is
94|Scene no. 68
94|looking away and staying quiet.
94|Scene no. 68
94|Waiting for the other
94|Scene no. 68
94|to just disappear.
94|Scene no. 68
94|You promised I'd be free to do whatever I wanted during the day.
94|It's not like your hands are chained.
94|Scene no. 69
94|That it'd be okay if I only looked for your corpse at night.
94|"Promise"
94|Scene no. 72
94|Look for your corpse?!
94|Wh-What do you mean?
94|Y-Your corpse?
94|A so-called "idol of worship."
94|My corpse was once worshipped at that shrine.
94|That place
94|Scene no. 73
94|It's nowhere to be found now, though.
94|is just like any other now.
94|Scene no. 73
94|It's a miracle that I can be like this, you know?
94|Wait.
94|That vampire,
94|I was drawn out by the queen of oddities, Shinobu.
94|Scene no. 76
94|Oshino Shinobu—
94|Something... undesirable.
94|Scene no. 76
94|formerly Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade...
94|The spell and its release were both amplified.
94|Scene no. 76
94|And also revived the serpent.
94|Scene no. 76
94|Maybe I should say it's thanks to her.
94|The undesirable elements that gathered there due to her are the energy sources that give me shape.
94|However, that spiritual energy got used for something rather pointless.
94|It was Shinobu. It was Shinobu.
94|Scene no. 80
94|Although it was Shinobu that used it.
94|She's both the cause and the effect.
94|Scene no. 80
94|She just makes messes to get the credit for cleaning them up.
94|Scene no. 80
94|Those undesirable elements were gathered there as a result of her own power,
94|so I guess she's free to do whatever she wants with them.
94|However, it's also true that I've ended up in a precarious situation due to what she did.
94|Got it.
94|"Anyway,"
94|Scene no. 64
94|Anyway...
94|Anyway, all I have to do is look for your corpse, right?
94|Just to stay in existence.
94|Scene no. 87
94|Just to stay possible.
94|Scene no. 87
94|You'll set me free once I find it, right?
94|Set you free?
94|I don't think I'm forcing you to do anything here.
94|I'm just taking advantage of your guilt.
94|A-Anyway,
94|I understand.
94|I'll look for your corpse and find it.
94|You're a lifesaver.
94|I won't thank you, though.
94|Why not?
94|Scene no. 93
94|Because you're a god?
94|Scene no. 94
94|So, Serpent...
94|Where's your corpse?
94|No idea.
94|Scene no. 94
94|Is it somewhere on that hill?
94|No idea.
94|Scene no. 95
94|When did it disappear?
94|No idea.
94|Scene no. 96
94|How big is it?
94|No idea.
94|Scene no. 97
94|How old is it?
94|No idea.
94|Scene no. 98
94|All right!
94|If I have that much information,
94|then I've pretty much found it already.
94|Wait, what?!
94|That's impossible!
94|Even if I spent my whole life looking for it!
94|I wouldn't find it even if I were reborn as a princess.
94|Why are you assuming that you'd be reborn as a princess?
94|Just match the "channel."
94|Scene no. 107
94|Well, don't worry about it.
94|Since you've become one with me, you'll be able to find it in no time.
94|In no time?
94|As long as you put in some effort, yeah.
94|I don't want to.
94|No, you really should.
94|Effort or endure
94|Scene no. 112
94|Well, I'll help you look for it.
94|said Nadeko.
94|Scene no. 113
94|But, Serpent,
94|I can go to school, right?
94|Serpent / speaking
94|Scene no. 114
94|Huh?
94|Well, I'm asking you if I can live my everyday life.
94|Y-You see, I...
94|I don't want to look s-suspicious.
94|Look suspicious?
94|To whom?
94|To Serpent's question,
94|Scene no. 119
94|Koyomi.
94|I answered honestly.
94|Scene no. 119
94|I told him it was nothing.
94|I told him it was just my imagination.
94|But isn't that more like you don't want him to worry, rather than think you're up to something?
94|Isn't that why you lied to him?
94|W-Well...
94|I thought you lied to him despite asking for help because you didn't want him to worry.
94|I failed. A gaffe.
94|Scene no. 126
94|Was I wrong?
94|N-No.
94|Yeah, that's right.
94|I don't want him to worry.
94|Not at all...
94|"It's no big deal."
94|Scene no. 129
94|Well, whatever.
94|Scene no. 129
94|Let's go with that, then.
94|Daytime is Nadeko Time.
94|Nighttime is my time.
94|I'll show my gratitude for your dedication
94|by swearing not to intrude on your personal time.

94|You liar.
94|You're supposed to be a god.
94|Okay, fine.
94|I just need to shut up, right?
94|Mr. Sasayabu
94|Scene no. 134
94|Hey, Sengoku!
94|nicknamed Mr. Panda.
94|Scene no. 134
94|What are you doing there?
94|N-N—
94|Nothing's off limits!
94|I bit my tongue.
94|Scene no. 139
94|Nothing...
94|The bell will ring soon, you know.
94|I understand.
94|Mr. Sasayabu's words
94|Scene no. 146
94|By the way, Sengoku.
94|What ever happened to that favor I asked of you?
94|Wh-What do you mean?
94|Is it any closer to getting resolved?
94|Er...
94|Hey, come on now.
94|You know that problem needs to be solved as soon as possible, right?
94|You're my last hope,
94|The best student in the class
94|Scene no. 153
94|Class Rep Sengoku.
94|The student who manages all class affairs
94|Scene no. 153
94|You're a class rep?
94|Yup.
94|I'm a class rep.
94|No way. Doesn't "class rep" mean class representative?
94|In other words, the best student in the class that manages all class affairs, right?
94|And you say you're a class rep?
94|Serpent / speaking
94|Scene no. 114
94|Well ?
94|You saw how my class had this strange atmosphere, right?
94|That's why, at the start of the second term,
94|there were no volunteers or recommendations for the position.
94|So I was chosen to take up the role.
94|You got the short end of the stick.
94|Scene no. 161
94|Such a masochistic expression.
94|Scene no. 161
94|How the hell did that happen?
94|I'm not good at expressing myself. I'm even worse at explaining things.
94|Scene no. 163
94|Well, if I had to say,
94|But still... uh...
94|Scene no. 163
94|it was because I was the only girl in class who hadn't gotten involved with the charms,
94|I guess?
94|Oh, so basically, it was by process of elimination?
94|You could say that, I guess.
94|Scene no. 165
94|In other words, they forced the job that nobody wanted themselves or others to do onto you, huh?
94|What a worthless bunch,
94|Serpent / speaking
94|Scene no. 114
94|eh?
94|It's not like they forced it onto me, though.
94|But that aside,
94|what was that teacher talking about just now?
94|What did he ask you to do?
94|That has nothing to do with you, does it?
94|I said the line I prepared for this scenario just according to the book.
94|Scene no. 173
94|It doesn't?
94|I thought we were partners—one in body and soul.
94|Well, don't.
94|My words didn't sound convincing at all.
94|Scene no. 176
94|It's so hard to harshly tell someone off.
94|Scene no. 176
94|He's been asking me to do something about the class atmosphere.
94|For a while now, even.
94|Say what?
94|What the hell?
94|Isn't that the mighty homeroom teacher's job?
94|W-Well yeah, it is.
94|I guess he passed the buck, so to speak.
94|That guy's even worse than me!
94|One glance is enough to tell you
94|that it's not an atmosphere that one kid alone could do something about from the inside.
94|Serpent / speaking
94|Scene no. 114
94|Well ?
94|It's not a big deal.
94|The matter is already behind me.
94|Scene no. 183
94|It's not a problem for me.
94|I've left it way behind me already.
94|Scene no. 184
94|I'm fine.
94|Not a problem?
94|Not a problem.
94|You missed the mark.
94|Scene no. 186
94|I mean,
94|it's not like I've actually done anything.
94|Anything?
94|Neither class rep work,
94|nor what Mr. Sasayabu asked me to do.
94|The bell will ring soon.
94|Scene no. 187
94|I haven't done anything.
94|I said that and started walking down the stairs.
94|The serpent fell silent.
94|Maybe he took the hint.
94|From then on until after school, he didn't utter a word.
94|Scene no. 191
94|That night,
94|I held up my end of the bargain and went out to look for the serpent's body.
94|Black
94|Unnumbered Scene
94|I snuck out of the house.
94|Hey, Serpent.
94|How should I look for your body?
94|Well, it's my physical form,
94|so if you get close to it, I'll vibrate like a cell phone.
94|So I should just keep walking like this?
94|Wh-What?!
94|Sweet!
94|That was one quick response!
94|In the direction of 5 o'clock!
94|Scene no. 215
94|Wh-What?
94|Are you telling me your corpse is buried in this sand pit?
94|Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
94|If you say so.
94|I'll take a look.
94|Scene no. 221
94|Serpent...
94|Hey, Serpent...
94|Hey, I can't find your body!
94|Hey! Hey! Hey!
94|Scene no. 227
94|Now you're staying silent.
94|Scene no. 227
94|I can't find it.
94|Red
94|Unnumbered Scene
94|Looks like it was a malfunction.
94|Malfunction?!
94|W-Well, you should've said so a lot sooner.
94|Why would you even malfunction, anyway?
94|Is it like how Doraemon's travel stick only has a seventy percent accuracy rate?
94|Nah, that's not it.
94|That's quite a nerdy way to put it.
94|Scene no. 233
94|This means my spiritual energy has scattered all over the place.
94|It's as simple as that.
94|Scattered?
94|Maybe I should say that it's been made to scatter.
94|I guess we'll have to try again tomorrow.
94|Serpent opposes
94|Scene no. 240
94|Oh, come on.
94|You're too quick to fold.
94|What are you, a pro gambler?
94|How about not giving up here and checking out one more place?
94|Nope.
94|Your servant is very tired, master.
94|Scene no. 241
94|I'm beat.
94|Since I was here already,
94|I decided to do more than just fill up the tiny holes I'd dug.
94|I ended up playing by building little hills and sandcastles, but I really shouldn't have.

94|Found her.
94|Sengoku!
94|K-Koyomi?!
94|Koyomi.
94|Accidentally,
94|Scene no. 252
94|because I didn't hide well enough under my hat,
94|Scene no. 252
94|Full name: Araragi Koyomi.
94|our eyes met directly.
94|Scene no. 252
94|He had a serious expression on his face.
94|Was he on a midnight stroll or something?
94|Black
94|Unnumbered Scene
94|Scene no. 258
94|Listen up, Sengoku.
94|What you just did would've gotten you a serious talking to if I wasn't the person sitting here.
94|How could you sneak out of home late at night to mess around outside?
94|His little sisters' room
94|Scene no. 264
94|It seems Koyomi was looking for me.
94|Well, my parents noticed that I was gone and the first person they thought of calling was Tsukihi.
94|And Tsukihi, being the kind of person she is,
94|apparently figured one night was no big deal
94|and instantly lied to them saying I was staying over at her place.
94|You just happened by? Koyomi
94|Scene no. 271
94|Are you stupid?!
94|What if Sengoku went extinct?!
94|It seems he ran out of the house after that and looked for me all over town.
94|In Koyomi's room
94|Scene no. 278
94|Good grief.
94|I don't even want to think about what would've happened if I hadn't found you.
94|I'm sorry.
94|It's okay if you feel bad about what you did.
94|Scene no. 281
94|So, tell me.
94|What was a good girl like you doing outside this late at night?
94|I just...
94|Scene no. 282
94|It's not like in June.
94|Scene no. 282
94|Sengoku? Wait, don't tell me...
94|Was what you said over the phone last night a lie?
94|Are you in some kind of trouble?
94|I'm not a victim.
94|Scene no. 286
94|N-No.
94|Oh, okay.
94|I was wrong, huh?
94|He actually believed it.
94|Scene no. 287
94|That's a relief.
94|And here I thought that unbeknownst to me, you got tricked by an oddity
94|into looking for something, or some other kinda convenient excuse of a task,
94|and that was why you dug up that sand pit.
94|That's not it at all.
94|Head on.
94|Scene no. 290
94|Y-You see, there's all kinds of trouble brewing in my class right now.
94|And I'm the class rep,
94|Some believable excuse.
94|Scene no. 291
94|Something that really is relevant nowadays.
94|Scene no. 291
94|s-so that kinda wore me out and suddenly made me want to get out of the house for a while.
94|Oh, I see.
94|That kinda thing happens, yeah.
94|Sengoku, I understand how you feel,
94|Black
94|Unnumbered Scene
94|but running away like that won't solve anything.
94|Running away won't solve anything?
94|You should've talked to me about it.
94|And about that trouble you mentioned in class.
94|What is it?
94|Is it related to Kaiki's charms?
94|No.
94|Sengoku.
94|He tells me
94|Scene no. 300
94|You're a middle schooler now,
94|with a serious face.
94|Scene no. 300
94|so I'm sure you've got your share of worries and problems,
94|but you don't have to shoulder them all alone.
94|I'm here for you.
94|And while I'm not really fit to offer you advice,
94|I can at least lend you an ear.
94|Y-You're right.
94|If I have any problems from now on,
94|I won't shoulder them alone. I'll be sure to talk to you about them.
94|Yeah, you do that.
94|Black
94|Unnumbered Scene
94|Anyway, you must be tired. Get some rest.
94|Rest?
94|Wait just a sec.
94|Where did he go?
94|Scene no. 307
94|Hey, Serpent.
94|Are we gonna be okay? We haven't been found out, right?
94|Serpent?
94|Then Koyomi came back.
94|Scene no. 316
94|Sorry to keep you waiting.
94|Here you go.
94|Sleepwear.
94|I borrowed it from Tsukihi.
94|Stay here tonight.
94|He didn't beat around the bush. He told me straight and direct.
94|Scene no. 321
94|It's gotten quite late.
94|Wh-Which room should I sleep in?
94|Huh? Which room?
94|This house doesn't have that many rooms,
94|so you'll have to sleep here.
94|I-In your room?!
94|O-On your bed?!
94|I guess.
94|You must be tired, so go ahead and take the bed.
94|O-Oh, no!
94|Y-You should sleep on the bed!
94|I-I-I—
94|I'll be fine sleeping under the bed!
94|The heck's with that train of thought?
94|There's no way I could sleep well here.
94|Scene no. 331
94|Scary!
94|Just sleep on the bed.
94|I'd get in big trouble if I made a middle school girl sleep under the bed.
94|The Fire Sisters would dish out some terrifying punishment to me.
94|B-But I can't just disregard you and sleep on the bed by myself!
94|Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
94|As if what he said was completely normal,
94|Scene no. 334
94|he put on a smile.
94|Scene no. 334
94|The bed's big enough for both of us.
94|Scene no. 336
94|Vampire Punch!
94|That was close.
94|We nearly violated the Tokyo Bill.
94|Goodness gracious.
94|Now, then.
94|Our senses are linked,
94|so my master's pain becomes my own.
94|But it looks like I can get away with it if I knock him out before he has the chance to feel any.
94|Are you all right, Little Miss Bangs?
94|Close call.
94|Good thing I made it in time.
94|You would've had to give birth at that tender age otherwise.
94|W-Was it that grave a situation?
94|Well, taking a close look, I can't say I don't understand.
94|No wonder my master's so attached to you.
94|A rather fine piece of work, I must say.
94|Her fangs sticking out between her lips
94|Scene no. 355
94|You're the next cutest thing to me!
94|Either way, my dear girl with bangs...
94|Like my master said,
94|you should sleep on the bed tonight.
94|Don't worry about my master. I'll take him downstairs and put him on the couch or something.
94|Uh...
94|It's just me...
94|Scene no. 360
94|I don't wanna cause a problem.
94|Scene no. 360
94|I'm sorry.
94|You apologize a lot.
94|But I'm not sure if you're apologizing because you think you're in the wrong,
94|or whether you're doing it because the situation calls for it—
94|like you're reading lines off a script.
94|I wonder, I really do.
94|Silence, huh?
94|Well, I suppose I'm not one to talk.
94|I spent quite a while staying mum just like that, after all.
94|Yellow
94|Unnumbered Scene
94|I couldn't resist asking.
94|Scene no. 372
94|U-Um...
94|What's... so funny?
94|Funny?
94|Nothing.
94|I simply laughed because I came to an understanding.
94|Just by trembling like that, you make one all intent to kill.
94|You sure are privileged...
94|is what I was thinking.
94|I-I'm not privileged.
94|Really?
94|Scene no. 387
94|Don't people act all nice to you just because you stay silent?
94|Don't people think you're smart just because you stay silent?
94|Don't you get away with whatever mistakes you make?
94|Don't people forgive you for your lies?
94|I-I...
94|Struggle to rebut
94|Scene no. 389
94|I hate that.
94|That's not privilege.
94|I-It's pretty much discrimination.
94|I'm...
94|She wouldn't listen
94|Scene no. 391
94|...having a rough time?
94|Don't people go out of their way to help you out when you are?
94|Don't they assume you're the victim in case of a dispute?
94|I thought that maybe you were acting like that on purpose,
94|but it seems I was mistaken.
94|In other words, you're a natural airhead,
94|and you don't have to put in any special effort to be that cute and make those gestures.
94|Airheaded and cute.
94|By the way, do you know what people like you are called here in Japan?
94|Hey, I'm asking you a question here.
94|You can answer me.
94|I-I don't know.
94|Evil
94|Scene no. 404
94|Evil?
94|Enchanting.
94|I'm saying you're more of a monster than oddities are.
94|Scene no. 409
94|Actually, forget about it.
94|Forgive me.
94|I went too far.
94|Look down
94|Scene no. 410
94|What in the world am I saying to a mere human?
94|You're fine as you are.
94|Keep living like that.
94|I couldn't care less.
94|Live like that, and die like that.
94|Go ahead and make Koyomi worry about you your entire life.
94|Good for you that you just happened to be cute.
94|Don't worry, I'll always remember your voice
94|Here's the path where I ran toward you
94|This is the sky I admired
94|Here we spend the time of our life
94|Will you laugh?
94|Will you be angry?
94|I just can't give up, and you're probably going to be angry with me
94|Countless times
94|I consider the possibility of just wanting you
94|(forevermore)
94|I still want a lie to deceive me
94|Come on, forgive me,
94|because my feelings are so chaotic
94|Yeah, I want you to know
94|that the life you found past despair is real
94|Don't forget that

94|What? Finding the body would put an end to it?
94|I see you're taking this seriously for once.
94|Do you know about the prisoner's dilemma?
94|Totally! Totally! Absolutely!
94|It states that even though there's a logically optimal decision, most people can't bring themselves to do it.
94|Let's find it for Nadeko!
94|Let's think about this.
94|Figuratively speaking, is there anybody who would betray their friend in such a situation?
94|Honestly, I don't think the deal would seem trustworthy.
94|Maybe I could trust it if it had realistic terms, but they go out of their way to encourage betrayal among friends.
94|Doing our best every day! We're the Fire Sisters!
94|For me...
94|Thank you...
94|They should do it like this.
94|"If you fess up, your friend walks free."
94|Wouldn't this get the truth out in no time?
94|Hey! Nadeko! Show the Fire Sisters you're thankful!
94|Yeah
94|I'll try
94|"If you don't fess up soon, your friend will do it for your sake."
94|You could appeal to their friendship.
94|Strangely, this feels much more cruel.

95|and it actually was an aberration, be sure to give me a call.

95|I'm well aware.
95|Animation Number 12
95|If you can be so small, why did you first appear so big that you could wrap yourself around that shrine?
95|It was stage direction! I was just directing my own entrance.
95|Aberrations lose the meaning of their existence if humans aren't surprised by them.
95|Kuchinawa-san...
95|Are you someone—Are you the snake revered at that shrine?
95|Exactly. Well, not completely. That shrine's been forsaken for a while now.
95|All it is now is a drift, filled with bad things. No, I think I'd be more correct saying it's a pile of rubbish.
95|Well...
95|Dear God...
95|Animation Number 19
95|Then what do you want me to do, Kuchinawa-san?
95|How can I make up...
95|Animation Number 19
95|I mean, what would you like of me?
95|Animation Number 19
95|What I would like to ask of you, Nadeko-chan, is to find something.

95|1st of November
95|20
95|The next morning I headed to school like always.
95|Yes. No matter how many hallucinations I see, I must go to school.
95|That's being a junior high student.
95|I get up in the morning, change into my uniform, and head out.
95|The usual way to school
95|Animation Number 28
95|A stunning display of junior high school life.
95|There's one thing different from usual: the white scrunchie wrapped around my right wrist.
95|Y-You know, Kuchinawa-san
95|I'm lucky that
95|Animation Number 34
95|it pretty well
95|Animation Number 34
95|fits my
95|Animation Number 34
95|usual style.
95|Animation Number 34
95|can't you make it so no one else can see you?
95|It's not impossible, but I don't want to use any more power than I am already.
95|Rest assured. They can't hear me.
95|And while we're at school, I'll pretend I'm just an accessory. I won't infringe on your everyday life.
95|Thus I arrived at the school.
95|Animation Number 36
95|Hey! Hey, Nadeko!
95|Animation Number 38
95|Why do you change shoes? Why is there a need to do such a thing?
95|I don't know. Why is it? I've never thought of it before.
95|Probably to keep the school building clean.
95|Um, don't talk at all, okay?
95|Animation Number 42
95|Yeah, I know that. You don't need to double-check with me.
95|I'm a pretty quiet guy in the first place. Just like you, Nadeko-chan.
95|Nanahyakuichi Public Middle School / Classroom
95|Animation Number 44
95|School, huh? There was a similar type of educational activity going on at the shrine in its day.
95|It's unnaturally orderly. Gives me the creeps...
95|No, is this something unique about this particular class?
95|Everyone seems to be keeping each other in check, and they're all uptight or something.
95|You know, Kuchinawa-san...
95|I left the classroom. I crossed the corridor and climbed the stairs.
95|Animation Number 53
95|I went all the way to the "off limits" door to the roof on the top floor.
95|Animation Number 53
95|What is it?
95|Shut up.
95|I'm a calm, shy, quiet girl.
95|Like someone who is unnoticeable?
95|Right. Someone who is unnoticeable.
95|That's what I am.
95|I start talking to my wrist.
95|Animation Number 56
95|It's me.
95|Animation Number 56
95|If you saw such a person, who is unnoticeable, talking to her wrist,
95|what do you think their classmates would think?
95|What would they think?
95|They'd all think, "How pitiful."
95|You think so? I don't think much will change at all.
95|What changes if your position in the class moves a bit?
95|Black Scene
95|Animation Number 'none'
95|I-In any case, Kuchinawa-san...
95|Come now, have you just been making your way through life with transitions like "in any case" and "that aside"?
95|"in any case"
95|Animation Number 64
95|"that aside"
95|Animation Number 64
95|Without conversations?
95|It's not that you're convinced of what I say, but you're not refuting it either.
95|So, pigeonholing it without consideration is the secret to your success?
95|In any case...
95|My survival technique.
95|Animation Number 68
95|It is
95|Animation Number 68
95|looking away and staying quiet.
95|Animation Number 68
95|Waiting for the other
95|Animation Number 68
95|to just disappear.
95|Animation Number 68
95|You promised me that I could do whatever I wanted during the day...
95|It's not like your hands are chained.
95|Animation Number 69
95|That it was okay to only look for your corpse at night...
95|"Promise"
95|Animation Number 72
95|Looking for your corpse? Wh-What do you mean?
95|K-Kuchinawa-san's... corpse?
95|In other words, my vessel. My corpse used to revered at that shrine,
95|but it's now lost.
95|That place
95|Animation Number 73
95|is just like any other now.
95|Animation Number 73
95|It's a sort of miracle I can be like this right now.
95|No, I have to say it's thanks to that vampire,
95|Oshino Shinobu, formerly Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade
95|I was drawn out by the queen of aberrations, Shinobu.
95|Animation Number 76
95|Something... undesirable.
95|Animation Number 76
95|The spell and its release were both amplified.
95|Animation Number 76
95|And also revived the Serpent.
95|Animation Number 76
95|The "bad things" gathering at the shrine thanks to her
95|are the source of energy supporting my current form.
95|But those same spiritual energies were also used for something completely trivial.
95|Well, that's thanks to Shinobu-chan as well.
95|It was Shinobu. It was Shinobu.
95|Animation Number 80
95|She's both the cause and the effect.
95|Animation Number 80
95|She just makes messes to get the credit for cleaning them up.
95|Animation Number 80
95|They were the "bad things" the vampire gathered into that energy drift as a result of her powers,
95|so it's up to her how she uses them up.
95|But because of that, it's true that the concept of my existence is on a thin rope now.
95|I understand.
95|In any case...
95|"In any case..."
95|Animation Number 64
95|In any case, I need to find your corpse now, right, Kuchinawa-san?
95|Just to stay in existence.
95|Animation Number 87
95|Just to stay possible.
95|Animation Number 87
95|If I find that vessel, you'll release me, right?
95|Release you?
95|I don't think I'm forcing you to do this, Nadeko-chan.
95|I'm just playing up on your sense of guilt.
95|I-In any case, I get it. I'll look for your vessel and find it.
95|That will be helpful. Though I won't thank you for it.
95|Why not?
95|Animation Number 93
95|So Kuchinawa-san, where is your corpse?
95|Because you're a god?
95|Animation Number 94
95|No idea.
95|Animation Number 94
95|Is it somewhere on that mountain?
95|No idea.
95|Animation Number 95
95|When did it disappear?
95|No idea.
95|Animation Number 96
95|How big is it?
95|No idea.
95|Animation Number 97
95|How old is it?
95|No idea.
95|Animation Number 98
95|Yeah! With that much information, it's as good as found!
95|Now wait a minute!
95|That's impossible! I can try this for all my life, but it's still impossible.
95|Even if I reincarnate as a princess...
95|What makes you think you'll reincarnate as a princess?
95|No, no, don't worry.
95|Just match the "channel."
95|Animation Number 107
95|Since you've assimilated with me, I'm sure you can find it quickly.
95|Quickly...
95|If you do your best, quickly.
95|But I don't want to give it my best...
95|No, that's where you're supposed to do your best.
95|Effort or endure
95|Animation Number 112
95|I'll help you look for it...
95|But, Kuchinawa-san, I can go to school, right?
95|said Nadeko.
95|Animation Number 113
95|Huh?
95|Serpent / speaking
95|Animation Number 114
95|Or rather, I'm asking if I can do everyday things normally...
95|B-Because I don't want
95|t-to raise suspicion.
95|Raise suspicion? Whose?
95|To the Serpent's question,
95|Animation Number 119
95|Koyomi-oniichan.
95|I answered honestly.
95|Animation Number 119
95|Because I said it was nothing. Because I said it was my imagination.
95|If you're going to say that, Nadeko-chan,
95|rather than raising suspicion, isn't it that you don't want to make him worry?
95|That's why you told a lie like that to Koyomi-oniichan.
95|Th-That's...
95|You said you wanted him to save you,
95|but I thought telling that kind of lie was because you didn't want him to worry about you. Was I wrong?
95|I failed. A gaffe.
95|Animation Number 126
95|Th-That's not wrong...
95|Yeah, that's right. I don't want him to worry about me.
95|To worry...
95|"It's no big deal."
95|Animation Number 129
95|Well, whatever.
95|Animation Number 129
95|Then, let's say that's that.
95|Daytime is your time, and nighttime is my time.
95|I will show gratitude to your self-sacrifice by swearing that I won't invade into your private times.
95|Nanahyakuichi Public Middle School
95|Animation Number 133
95|Liar. And you're a deity too!
95|The top of the stairs leading to the roof of the school
95|Animation Number 133
95|All right, I get it. I just have to stay quiet, right?
95|Hey, Sengoku.
95|Sasayabu-sensei
95|Animation Number 134
95|What are you doing there?
95|Uh, um, anything goes.
95|I bit my tongue.
95|Animation Number 139
95|I mean, nothing.
95|Class is about to start.
95|All right.
95|By the way, Sengoku...
95|What happened with that thing I asked you to do?
95|Wh-What happened?
95|Has it come any closer to being resolved?
95|Um...
95|Come on, I'm counting on you.
95|You realize, like I do, that the problem needs to be resolved quickly, right?
95|You're my only hope, Class Prez Sengoku.
95|The best student in the class
95|Animation Number 153
95|The student who manages all class affairs
95|Animation Number 153
95|You're class prez, Nadeko-chan?
95|Yeah, I'm class prez.
95|You're kidding. Class prez is short for class president, right?
95|In other words, the most distinguished student that manages over the class, right?
95|And that's you, Nadeko-chan? Huh?
95|Serpent / speaking
95|Animation Number 114
95|You realized as well that the class has a strange feel to it, right Kuchinawa-san?
95|So when the second term started, no one volunteered or nominated anyone as a candidate.
95|And so, Nadeko was chosen.
95|You got the short end of the stick.
95|Animation Number 161
95|Such a masochistic expression.
95|Animation Number 161
95|Under what circumstances does something like that happen?
95|If I were to force myself to answer...
95|But still... uh...
95|Animation Number 163
95|I think it was because I was the only girl in the class that didn't get her hands on a "magic charm."
95|Ah, so it was merely a process of elimination.
95|You could say that, I guess.
95|Animation Number 165
95|Basically, work no one wanted to do, or force someone else to do, was all forced on you, Nadeko-chan.
95|What a group of good-for-nothings, huh?
95|Serpent / speaking
95|Animation Number 114
95|I don't think it's quite something that they forced on me, but...
95|For now, we'll say "that's that."
95|What was that teacher talking about earlier? What is it that he asked you to do?
95|It doesn't involve you, Kuchinawa-san.
95|It doesn't involve me? And here I thought you and I were partners: one and the same.
95|D-Don't think that...
95|My words didn't sound convincing at all.
95|Animation Number 176
95|It's so hard to harshly tell someone off.
95|Animation Number 176
95|I was told to do something about the atmosphere of the classroom quite a while ago.
95|Huh?
95|Come on, what's with that? Isn't that the job of the teacher in charge of that class?
95|Yeah. Well, you're right about that.
95|You could say, it's tossing all responsibility to someone else.
95|Ain't that even worse than me?
95|Even after one glance, I can see that atmosphere isn't something one child can fix from the inside, huh?
95|Serpent / speaking
95|Animation Number 114
95|It's all right.
95|The matter is already behind me.
95|Animation Number 183
95|I'm not troubled by it or anything, so I'm fine.
95|I've left it way behind me already.
95|Animation Number 184
95|Not troubled?
95|I'm not troubled.
95|Because I really have done nothing about it.
95|You missed the mark.
95|Animation Number 186
95|Nothing?
95|None of my work as class prez, and none of the work my teacher entrusted me with.
95|The bell will ring soon.
95|Animation Number 187
95|I haven't done anything.
95|And so, I started to walk downstairs.
95|Kuchinawa-san became very silent. I wonder if he took the hint.
95|After that bit, Kuchinawa-san didn't say a single word until school was out.
95|Animation Number 191
95|That night, just like I promised Kuchinawa-san, I went out looking for his corpse.
95|Black Scene
95|Animation Number 'none'
95|I snuck out of the house.
95|Kuchinawa-san,
95|How should I look for the vessel?
95|In the end, the vessel is my physical body.
95|So if I pass near it, I'll be vibrating like a cell phone on silent mode.
95|So I just have to keep walking without stopping?
95|Wh-What is it?
95|We already have a response!
95|In the direction of 5 o'clock!
95|Animation Number 215
95|Wh-What? Are you saying your corpse is buried in this sandbox?
95|No doubt about it.
95|If you say so, Kuchinawa-san... I'll look here just in case.
95|Kuchinawa-san...
95|Hey, Kuchinawa-san.
95|Hey, the vessel isn't here.
95|Hey! Hey! Hey!
95|Animation Number 227
95|Now you're staying silent.
95|Animation Number 227
95|It's not here...
95|Red Scene
95|Animation Number 'none'
95|Heh, it looks like that was a false alarm.
95|F-False alarm?
95|I-If it's a false alarm, l-let me know a bit earlier!
95|Why are there false alarms?
95|Is it something like Doraemon's "Missing Person Cane" only having 70% accuracy?
95|No, it's not that.
95|Simply put, it just means that my spiritual energies have been dispersed.
95|Dispersed?
95|More like forcefully dispersed.
95|Then in any case, we can try again tomorrow...
95|Come on now, Nadeko-chan, you quit too easily. What kind of genius gambler are you?
95|Why not try one more spot instead of giving up so easily?
95|No go. I'm tired.
95|Your servant is very tired, master.
95|Animation Number 241
95|Since I went through so much effort, not only did I fill up the several holes I had dug,
95|but I ended up playing by making things like small mountains and castles. That was wrong of me.
95|Black Scene
95|Animation Number 'none'
95|Oh, I found you, Sengoku!
95|K-Koyomi-oniichan?
95|Koyomi-oniichan.
95|Accidentally,
95|Animation Number 252
95|Full name: Araragi Koyomi.
95|because I didn't hide well enough under my hat,
95|Animation Number 252
95|With a very serious look on his face...
95|Is he taking a stroll in the middle of the night?
95|Listen up, Sengoku.
95|What you did was something anyone other than me would be completely furious about.
95|To leave your house late at night and be off fooling around somewhere...
95|His little sisters' room
95|Animation Number 264
95|It seems that Koyomi-oniichan was looking for me.
95|Well, when my parents realized I had run away from home,
95|they called Tsukihi-chan's place as somewhere I might likely be.
95|And, Tsukihi-chan being Tsukihi-chan, thought "she'll be fine if it's one night"
95|and promptly replied with "she's over at our place" or a lie of that sort, but...
95|You just happened by? Koyomi-oniichan
95|Animation Number 271
95|You idiot! What if Sengoku goes extinct because of that!
95|And so he bolted out of the house and looked all over town for me.
95|Really, if I hadn't found you, what would have happened to you by now?
95|I'm sorry.
95|Well, if you're regretting what you did, that's fine.
95|Hmm?
95|So, what is it?
95|Why is a good kid like you walking around so late at night?
95|It's not like in June.
95|Animation Number 282
95|Sengoku, don't tell me...
95|Don't tell me that what you told me on the phone last night was a lie
95|and you've gotten involved in some difficult situation?
95|Th-That's not it.
95|Oh, okay, that's not it. I'm glad.
95|I totally thought that some aberration I'm not aware of smooth-talked you
95|and asked a favor of you to its advantage, like looking for something,
95|and you dug up that sandbox looking for it.
95|Not at all... It's nothing like that.
95|J-Just a bit... Well, my class has a lot of troubles right now, and I'm the class prez...
95|S-So things are just getting very tough on me, and I suddenly wanted to get out of the house.
95|Oh, I see.
95|Things like that happen.
95|I understand how you feel, but Sengoku...
95|If you keep running away, things won't ever get resolved.
95|If I keep running, things won't get resolved.
95|If anything, you could've asked me for advice about your classroom troubles.
95|What's it about? Something to do with Kaiki's charms?
95|Nope...
95|Sengoku. You're still in junior high.
95|I'm sure you have lots of worries and troubles right now,
95|but there's no need to carry the weight by yourself.
95|I'm not really one to be consulted with, but I can at least listen to what you have to say.
95|Th-That's true.
95|From now on, if I have anything troubling me,
95|I won't carry the weight by myself, and I'll ask for your advice.
95|Yeah, please do that.
95|Black Scene
95|Animation Number 'none'
95|For now, you must be tired, so rest a bit.
95|Rest?
95|Wait here a minute.
95|H-Hey, Kuchinawa-san...
95|Are we okay? He hasn't caught on to us, right?
95|Kuchinawa-san?
95|Sorry to make you wait.
95|Here you go.
95|Pajamas. I borrowed them from Tsukihi-chan.
95|Huh?
95|You should stay the night. It's already pretty late.
95|Wh-Which room should I be sleeping in?
95|Well, which room?
95|My house doesn't have that many rooms, so you'll have to sleep in this room...
95|I-In Koyomi-oniichan's room?
95|On his bed?
95|Well, yeah. Since you're probably tired, you can use my bed.
95|Th-That's too much... Y-You should be sleeping on the bed, Koyomi-oniichan!
95|I-I'm perfectly fine sleeping under the bed!
95|How did you come up with that idea? That's scary.
95|There's no way I could sleep well here.
95|Animation Number 331
95|Just sleep on the bed.
95|If I were to say I let a junior high girl sleep under the bed, that would cause a huge problem.
95|The Fire Sisters would have the most horrifying of sanctions for me.
95|B-But, I can't shove you aside, Koyomi-oniichan, and sleep alone on the bed.
95|Oh no, no, that's fine.
95|As if what he said was completely normal,
95|Animation Number 334
95|he put on a smile.
95|Animation Number 334
95|Two people should fit on that bed perfectly fine.
95|Vampire Punch!
95|Whew. That was a close one.
95|He was this close to breaking a metropolitan area ordinance. Jeez.
95|Now...
95|Our senses are linked, so my master's pain becomes my pain as well.
95|But it seems if I knock him unconscious without an instant of pain, I don't have any problems.
95|Are you all right, bangs-girl?
95|Risky, risky. I'm glad I somehow made it in time.
95|You were just about to be raising a child at your age.
95|I-It was that serious a situation?
95|Well, looking at you like this, I can definitely see why he'd think that...
95|My master is very keen on you. A rather orderly model we have.
95|Second cutest after me!
95|Well, bangs-girl.
95|My master said this as well, but you should sleep on that bed tonight.
95|I'll drag my master to the first floor and toss him on the sofa or something, so rest assured.
95|Th...
95|I don't wanna cause a problem.
95|Animation Number 360
95|I'm sorry...
95|Hmph, you really apologize often.
95|But what's the rationale?
95|Are you apologizing because you feel you're at fault
95|or because you took the hint that "this is a situation where I should apologize" as if reading a script?
95|Which is it, I wonder?
95|Silence, huh?
95|Well, I'm not one to be able to comment on all of that.
95|I was quiet for quite a long time, just like that.
95|U-Um...
95|I couldn't resist asking.
95|Animation Number 372
95|Wh-What's so funny?
95|Funny? Hmph, there's nothing funny about this.
95|I merely laughed because I was just accepting the facts.
95|Merely by trembling like that, people lose the will to kill you.
95|I'm saying it must be nice to have that advantage.
95|I-I don't have an advantage at all.
95|Is that really so, huh?
95|Animation Number 387
95|Just by staying quiet, aren't people nice to you?
95|Just by staying quiet, don't people think you're smart?
95|Even if you fail, people don't get mad, right?
95|Even if you lie, don't people forgive you?
95|Th-That's...
95|Struggle to rebut
95|Animation Number 389
95|...that's exactly what I hate!
95|That's not an advantage at all.
95|Things like that are nothing but discrimination, and I-I...
95|When you're in trouble...
95|She wouldn't listen
95|Animation Number 391
95|...doesn't someone help you without asking?
95|Like if you were in a dispute, they assume that you were the victim...
95|Hmph. I thought you might be playing the part on purpose, but it doesn't seem so.
95|Which means you naturally act that way, with no special effort for that cuteness.
95|"Naturally cute."
95|Do you know what they call beings like you in Japanese, by chance?
95|Come now, that was a question. You can answer it.
95|I-I don't know. Fiendish?
95|Devilish.
95|I'm just saying, you're more of a monster than aberrations are.
95|Animation Number 409
95|No, no, it's all right. Sorry. I apologize. I spoke a bit too harsh.
95|Look down
95|Animation Number 410
95|What am I talking about to a mere human?
95|You can stay just the way you are.
95|Keep living the way you do. I couldn't care less.
95|Live like that. And die like that.
95|And like that, you can have Koyomi-oniichan worry about you for the rest of your life.
95|Good for you! That you just happened to be cute...
95|Ima mo zutto, sono koe wo oboeteru kara
95|I will always remember your voice, forever.

95|You seem earnest today.
95|Do you know of the "Prisoner's Dilemma"?
95|I know, I know, I know all about it!
95|It's quite easy, psychologically speaking, to grasp why people always choose what's best for them.
95|Let's find it for Nadeko-chan's sake!
95|In that situation however, can some people really betray their partner?
95|Honestly, I would find that kinda deal fishy anyway.
95|Even if I was promised something in exchange,
95|Let's do our best tomorrow too, Fire Sisters!
95|You'd do that for me? Thanks...
95|I would find hard to trust someone who thinks I could betray a partner.
95|I'd rather go like this: "If you confess, your partner is free to go."
95|You're more likely to get a confession that way.
95|Listen Nadeko-chan! You should give physical form to your gratitude towards the fire sisters
95|Right. I'll do that.
95|Wow!
95|"Even if you don't confess, your partner will do it for your sake sooner or later anyway."
95|I call it the Friendship Gamble tactic!
95|Strangely, it feels even crueller than the regular approach.

96|Oh, I get it now.

96|What a gentleman.

96|Getting special treatment because I am makes me...

96|Is that why you grew your bangs out and covered your face?
96|And I guess that's also why you never dress up, and wear such lame clothes all the time.
96|That's why you're wearing that lame scrunchie.
96|I see how it is now.
96|Then let me take all that into consideration and offer you just one piece of advice.
96|A-Advice?
96|Yup. Pay attention.
96|Er...
96|I get what you're trying to say,
96|but isn't that your fault for being cute and nothing else?

96|It's clear as day.
96|Obvious as hell.

96|To begin with, why'd you even fall in love with him?

96|Wh-Why?
96|Well, the two of you only interacted during that second year of elementary school, right?

96|Your love for my brother is real, right?
96|It's not like you love him as a nice big brother figure, or as a friend, right?

96|Unnumbered Scene
96|When did you find out?
96|W-Well...
96|I often spot him walking around with a girl.
96|Don't get spotted often, stupid brother of mine!
96|It's a different girl each time,
96|but well, I didn't get the impression that they were his girlfriends.
96|That brother of mine's too careless!
96|But among them, there was one girl that clearly looked like she was his lover—
96|a girl perfect for him.
96|Just different.
96|Scene no. 144
96|Perfect for him, eh?
96|Someone who stood out
96|Scene no. 144
96|was with him.
96|Scene no. 144
96|Yeah, she certainly does suit him perfectly.
96|It's almost like she has to be the one for him.
96|He didn't treat her like his younger sister
96|Scene no. 145
96|People might think he's the one for her,
96|and, of course, not like an older sister either—
96|Scene no. 145
96|but in truth, it's the opposite.
96|I think it was last month.
96|Oh, it's November now, so the month before last.
96|What I consider a problem now
96|is how you can still be in love with him even though you know he has a girlfriend.
96|Got that?
96|S-So you consider it a problem...
96|What?
96|Are you saying it's not?
96|I-I mean, it's not like...
96|It's not like I plan to snatch him away.
96|Not like I can, anyway.
96|If he has a girlfriend,
96|then I don't intend to cause him any problems.
96|Just being in love is enough for me...
96|Scene no. 159
96|That's what I'm calling a problem!
96|You're so obviously in love with him,
96|yet you don't want to go steady with him?
96|You don't want to be lovers?
96|I have no idea what you're talking about.
96|So what, is my brother just like some silver-screen idol to you?
96|I love him as a member of the opposite sex,
96|Scene no. 168
96|Just like some manga hero?
96|so can I really stop at that?
96|Scene no. 170
96|Is he nothing but a target of your admiration?
96|"Stop at that"...
96|Scene no. 174
96|That doesn't mean
96|Scene no. 174
96|that my feelings are fledgling.
96|Scene no. 174
96|I'm saying you're being wishy-washy.
96|You've loved him since second grade,
96|but you're being surprisingly understanding.
96|On the other hand, you invite him over to your place,
96|dress provocatively,
96|sleep on his bed,
96|be all proactive,
96|and turn a blind eye to the fact he has a girlfriend.
96|That said, you don't give up on him,
96|and act all happy by making him worry.
96|I'm not acting all happy!
96|If I could state my impressions frankly,
96|let's see...
96|She's telling me I
96|Scene no. 186
96|love someone
96|Scene no. 186
96|It feels like you're relieved to have fallen into a love that will never come true.
96|and to never change that
96|Scene no. 186
96|She's telling me I love someone out of reach
96|Scene no. 186
96|or entirely fictitious
96|Scene no. 186
96|just so that I won't be hurt
96|Scene no. 186
96|Loving someone who won't turn you down
96|Scene no. 186
96|sure is
96|Scene no. 186
96|the easy way out
96|Scene no. 186
96|Haven't you had it quite easy all this while due to being in love with my brother?
96|Wh-What do you mean?
96|Like, it must've been easy to turn down guys who asked you out, right?
96|You could just say you loved someone else.
96|Actually I
96|Scene no. 192
96|turned down a confession from a boy on the baseball team
96|Scene no. 192
96|in my first term with that exact reason.
96|Scene no. 192
96|Tsukihi,
96|I simply don't want to cause him any problems.
96|Problems, huh?
96|Y-Yup.
96|I believe I said this earlier, but that's the last thing I want to do.
96|Or what, is that no good?
96|Am I not allowed to just be in love with him?
96|Of course, I know there's no way I could cause him problems.
96|I don't believe for one second that I can beat her, after all.
96|Every guy—nah.
96|I'm sure even girls would find that point of view cute.
96|They'd find it pitiable, lovable, and cute.
96|You know how people buy lottery tickets?
96|They buy them even though you don't normally win anything.
96|Yet, when you ask them why they buy them, they say they're getting themselves dreams.
96|That's
96|Scene no. 210
96|a major
96|Scene no. 210

96|Scene no. 210
96|Whenever I hear that, I end up thinking, "get yourself a dose of reality instead."

96|I believe the words "have a dream" mean "take a long look at reality."

96|Scene no. 212
96|If you really intend to ask my brother out,
96|or duke it out with that girl,
96|I want to cheer you on.
96|At the very least, I want to silently watch over you.
96|That's how I've felt all this time,
96|but I'm done.
96|I'm tired of it.
96|I'll put an end to this.

96|Huh?
96|If you're that hung up about your bangs,
96|I could fix them up for you, you know?
96|Well ?
96|a proposal.
96|Scene no. 269
96|C-Can you do that?
96|I'm a god.
96|If you retrieved my body for me,
96|fixing your bangs would be no big deal.
96|I don't mind granting that wish for you.
96|Oh.
96|Come on, Nadeko.
96|You might be able to find it as soon as tonight.
96|My body, that is.
96|What do you mean?
96|Thanks to Koyomi taking care of you,

96|Have you made any progress?
96|How's it going to get solved in one day?
96|Scene no. 292
96|Like always, I averted my eyes, looked downward, and said nothing.
96|I did that and waited for Mr. Sasayabu to get tired of me and walk away.
96|And length of time aside,
96|Scene no. 292
96|it's likely never going to get solved.

96|Mr. Sasayabu could still see my face clearly.
96|If he could see my expressions,
96|then he must've figured out that I wasn't as troubled by it as I was letting on.
96|Oh well.
96|I thought to use a plausible excuse to get through the situation.
96|I'd start with the usual.
96|Let's go with that.
96|Scene no. 301
96|Bangs or no bangs, I'd just do what I always did.
96|I'd start off by apologizing, and then take it from there.
96|I wonder if a normal excuse will do it.
96|Scene no. 302
96|Shut the fuck up!
96|Huh?
96|Did someone say something?
96|Like hell I've made any damn progress!
96|You think you can just force me to do all your work for you?
96|Well ?
96|Scene no. 314
96|Every fucking time you see me, it's the same old "what happened to that thing" shtick.
96|Well, nothing fucking happened!
96|Don't you know better than anyone that you're asking for the impossible?
96|Well?
96|Wh-What's gotten into you, Sengoku?
96|Don't put your filthy hands on me!
96|The fuck do you think I am?
96|A doll or something?
96|Yeah, yeah, I'm just cute and nothing else.
96|I let people say whatever the hell they damn please to me!
96|But it's not like I don't feel a damn thing, you hear me?!
96|Don't you dare go thinking meek people are meek on the inside too!
96|Hey, what's wrong?
96|Calm down!
96|Just calm down.
96|You must be tired or something.
96|Calm down?
96|Look where staying calm has gotten us, dude.
96|Tired?!
96|Can't you tell that by a glance?!
96|S-Sengoku!
96|I simply believed you were a responsible—
96|Holy shit, you really think I'm a responsible kid?!
96|At least see through Sengoku Nadeko and figure out how pathetic she is!
96|Don't go around getting fooled by appearances!
96|Pull yourself together!
96|That's right.
96|I'm just cute and nothing else!
96|Don't put your faith in a bitch like me!
96|This is contrary to everything I ever did.
96|Scene no. 340
96|Wh-Where are you going, Sengoku?
96|Huh?
96|Ain't that obvious, dipshit?!

96|What, if someone you considered a friend was jealous of you,
96|would they no longer be your friend?
96|Would it be all over if they lied to you?!

96|Scene no. 372
96|So you've gotta turn over a new leaf!
96|You've gotta rewrite it all!
96|Sure, for a while you couldn't trust anyone due to those damn charms,
96|but make it so you can look back and say "we made up"!
96|Yeah, you guys are lowest of the low.
96|Hypocrites that put up facades!
96|Scumbags who betray someone the moment they have their trust!
96|The most vulgar beings on Earth!
96|However!
96|However, there must've been some truth to it all somewhere!
96|I yelled from the bottom of my heart.
96|Scene no. 378
96|Even your "lies" might've held true at some point!
96|Lies?
96|Betrayal?
96|Deceit?

96|Well ?
96|Who died and made you the boss of others?
96|Don't get all nitpicky about who you socialize with, retards!
96|I said one last thing. I yelled it.

96|I left early.
96|I totally did.
96|I then walked absentmindedly.
96|More absentmindedly than I did on the way to school.
96|Well, thinking back on it now, it sure was a fun walk to school.
96|The walk to school, that is.
96|Honestly, what was I worried about during all that time, exactly?
96|I had no idea where I was going.
96|Scene no. 393
96|Really,
96|Scene no. 393
96|where
96|Scene no. 393
96|am I going?
96|Scene no. 393
96|This goes without saying, but well, let me say it anyway.
96|Nadeko,
96|it's not like what happened earlier was because I took control of your body
96|and went around saying whatever the hell I wanted to.
96|It's just that becoming one with me showed some startling effects.
96|Or well, it's just that the shackles you normally put on yourself came off.
96|I know. Shut up already.
96|That was me. None other than Sengoku Nadeko.
96|Myself.
96|I said what I wanted to say, that's all.
96|I know that.
96|You didn't do anything wrong.
96|Exactly.
96|If you know that—
96|But I do think it was your fault.
96|Blue

96|For now,
96|let's just say my school life— my entire life has met its demise.
96|I try to change the topic.
96|Scene no. 403
96|So,
96|while we're at it, shall we put an end to everything, Serpent?
96|Huh?
96|You already know where your body is, right?
96|Let's find your body quick,
96|have you recover your powers of old,
96|and then...
96|Let's say goodbye.
96|And then it'll all be over.
96|Okay?
96|I can't think about the rest.
96|Scene no. 410
96|Nothing comes to mind.
96|Scene no. 410
96|Yeah, okay.
96|Then tell me, Serpent.
96|Where should I go and look?
96|Koyomi's house.
96|That's where everything will end.
96|Scene no. 415
96|Please, airtight spaces are no match for me.
96|Neutralizing all kinds of barriers is what I'm all about.
96|But this is really strange.
96|Why is your body in Koyomi's house?
96|Someone probably looked for my body, which was taken out of the shrine, and found it before me.
96|I bet they entrusted your Koyomi with it.
96|Entrusted?
96|Who did?
96|Who knows?
96|Probably that specialist with the Hawaiian outfit.
96|I think what Tsukihi said was probably right.
96|Huh?
96|I'm still in love with Koyomi because that way, I can get by without getting hurt.
96|I mean,
96|Black
96|Unnumbered Scene
96|love uses up a lot of someone's energies, doesn't it?

96|I'm not like you, but I bet falling in love, or having others fall in love with you must be really tiring.
96|Black
96|Unnumbered Scene
96|In that case, using a love that will never come true as a disguise might make things a whole lot easier.
96|You won't lose your way or get distracted.
96|Tsukihi was right.
96|If not, it just doesn't make sense.
96|How else could someone as halfhearted as me stay in love with a friend's brother she hardly knew for six whole years?
96|It's impossible, don't you think?
96|If I were to guess,
96|I'd have to say it was because he was Araragi Koyomi.
96|In other words—
96|well, these might not be the right words to use in this situation—
96|I'd have to say it was because he was at a height I could never reach.
96|A dream that remains unfulfilled.

96|That's Koyomi for you!
96|He's extreme!
96|Actually, this sure is something.
96|Hey, Nadeko.
96|Shut up.
96|Your body might be somewhere between the pages of such books.
96|Nadeko!
96|Wh-What?
96|What about the girl on this page?
96|Not that.
96|I'm talking about the bookmark that was on that page.
96|Bookmark?
96|Is this not a bookmark, but a talisman?
96|I see now.
96|It was stored in that form all along, huh?
96|My body was preserved not in its physical form,
96|but as a drawing, huh?
96|I didn't see this coming at all!
96|The serpent had never been in this good a mood.
96|Scene no. 460
96|Come on, Nadeko.
96|Hurry up and feed me that talisman.
96|Feed?
96|Don't worry.
96|I'll keep my promise.
96|I'll revive your bangs for you.
96|Actually, I guess that won't be enough to thank you.
96|I'll also grant any other wish you may have.
96|Don't you have any wishes, Nadeko?
96|I don't care if you aim too high. Do it.
96|Aim too high?
96|What should I wish for?
96|Scene no. 470

96|Don't you have a wish you'd like a god to grant?
96|A wish I'd like granted...
96|A prayer is fine too.
96|My love...
96|I'd like my love for Koyomi be requited.
96|Could that kinda wish also come true?

96|Unnumbered Scene
96|No, it won't, Sengoku.
96|Don't worry, I'll always remember your voice
96|Here's the path where I ran toward you
96|This is the sky I admired
96|Here we spend the time of our life
96|Will you laugh?
96|Will you be angry?
96|I just can't give up, and you're probably going to be angry with me
96|Countless times
96|I consider the possibility of just wanting you
96|(forevermore)
96|I still want a lie to deceive me
96|Come on, forgive me,
96|because my feelings are so chaotic
96|Yeah, I want you to know
96|that the life you found past despair is real
96|Don't forget that

96|They say that pity is not for the sake of another, but...
96|But?
96|It seems a lot of kids misunderstand this to mean that showing pity doesn't help someone else.
96|Unforgivable!
96|How dare you do this to my friend?!
96|Yeah, I know.
96|The real meaning is that pity doesn't make the one in trouble feel better, but rather the one attempting to help.
96|But if you think about it that way, you can't really claim the so-called mistake is entirely wrong.
96|Tsukihi is scary when she's angry.
96|Snip Snap
96|Punishment!
96|If you're only showing pity out of a desire to elevate yourself,
96|you never even considered what kind of help the other might need.
96|That's another pretty cruel interpretation.
96|Makes you think, doesn't it?
96|You'll think, when someone is in trouble,
96|"Am I doing this for my own sake?"
96|New style!
96|Whoah!
96|"Am I doing this for them?"
96|"Am I being sincere or hypocritical?"
96|Doesn't that paralyze you with doubt?
96|The bottom line is that pity paralyzes you!
96|Have fun with the next one.
96|This isn't fun to think about.

97|Wait, whoa!
97|Nadeko-chan!
97|You surprised me! Wh-Why are you in Onii-chan's bed?
97|I totally thought I was embracing him!
97|Morning, Tsukihi-chan.
97|Y-Yeah. Morning, Nadeko-chan.
97|I get it. My brain's finally working.
97|Onii-chan found you and brought you over, didn't he?
97|In other words, he let you have the bed and is sleeping downstairs.
97|What a gentleman!
97|Y-Yeah...
97|What is it, Nadeko-chan? Feeling off?
97|If you're looking down like that, I can't see your cute face.

97|I'm not cute.

97|Animation Number 23
97|even lower.
97|Animation Number 23
97|I-I'm not cute at all.
97|What are you saying? You're cute!
97|You're cute, Nadeko-chan. Very cute. Super cute!
97|I
97|Animation Number 26
97|The cutest organism on Earth isn't a stretch.
97|It's written "must be loved" it's so cute.
97|meant to say something,
97|Animation Number 30
97|Cutely, cutely cute! You're cute!
97|but her repeated saying
97|Animation Number 32
97|When we started the 2nd year together back in April, the first thing that came to mind was, "Wow, how cute!"
97|of "cute" silenced me.
97|Animation Number 35
97|"She's the cutest right after me!"
97|The moment I saw you I thought, "Oh, I have to be friends with her!"
97|Th-Then i-if I weren't cute,
97|you wouldn't have become friends with me back then, Tsukihi-chan?
97|What's that? What do you mean?
97|I-I'm sorry. I-It's nothing!
97|"Sorry" isn't what I want to hear. I asked what you meant.
97|Can you answer me, Nadeko-chan?
97|Or are you unable to? Or you don't want to?
97|I-I'm sorry.
97|I said I didn't want you to say you're sorry. What, I'm not asking it right? Is it my fault?
97|Or are you apologizing because you feel guilty about something?
97|I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared.
97|Animation Number 47
97|I-It's not...
97|Okay, time to hit you...
97|What answer will make her hit me?
97|Animation Number 50
97|She'll hit me even if I say nothing
97|Animation Number 51
97|In the gut!
97|Hold on!
97|I'll say it! I'll say it! I'll say it!
97|Critical point reached
97|Animation Number 54
97|Y-You see, I was told by this person, "Good thing you happen to be cute."
97|Technically, she's a vampire, not a person

97|I-It's not like I chose to be... Being shown favoritism just for that...
97|...makes you feel guilty? So that's why you grew out your bangs and hide your face like that?
97|And why you dress down on a daily basis and wear all those unstylish clothes...
97|...like that tasteless scrunchie.
97|So that's what it was...
97|Well, taking that into account, let me give you a word of advice.
97|A-Advice?
97|Yeah, listen closely. Um...
97|I get what you're trying to say, but isn't it your fault that all you are is cute?
97|Tsukihi said:
97|Animation Number 79
97|Idiot!
97|Who told you that in the first place?
97|Wh-Who?
97|Onii-chan, by any chance?
97|N-Never. He would never say anything like that...
97|Speaking of which, you're in love with him, right?
97|My big secret.
97|Animation Number 89
97|Wh-What are you talking about? Do you have proof?
97|I sounded like the criminal in an old mystery novel.
97|Animation Number 93
97|Well, you don't have to hide it. It's obvious. It's apparent.
97|He's probably the only one who hasn't noticed.
97|So, Nadeko-chan, how'd you fall in love with him in the first place?
97|Black Scene
97|Animation Number 'none'
97|H-How?
97|The only time you had contact with him was when we were in 2nd grade, right?
97|Then how were you able to keep being in love with him for all this time?
97|It goes back to when he was six years old
97|Animation Number 101
97|Red Scene
97|Animation Number 'none'
97|What could that be called? It seems to me it's far more than being "madly in love."
97|W-Well...
97|I'll double-check. Not that I need to.
97|This "being in love" with him you're speaking of
97|isn't about him as a "kind brother" or "just a friend." It's not, right?
97|It's like you want to go steady with him or be lovers. That kind of love, right?
97|Love as a member of the opposite sex
97|Animation Number 120
97|Y-Yeah, that's right.
97|You want to make out with him, right?
97|I-I do, yeah.
97|And do this and that...
97|I do...
97|The serpent on my right wrist——

97|Animation Number 125
97|I-I'm in love with Koyomi-oniichan.
97|I love him as a man.
97|I see.
97|But he has a girlfriend, you know.

97|My heart throbs.
97|Nadeko Medusa Part Three
97|Font used in the video: HGP Mincho B
97|I see. So you knew after all.
97|Now, Nadeko-chan...
97|Since we're both women, let's have a heart-to-heart.
97|When did you find out?
97|Wh-When was it...
97|I often spot him walking alongside other women...
97|Stop being spotted so often, Bro.
97|And it's a different woman each time, so I thought that none of them were his girlfriend.
97|My brother's too careless.
97|But one among them was obviously his girlfriend, a perfect match for him.
97|A perfect match, you say...
97|True, she's a perfect match. To the point that she's the only one for him.
97|He didn't treat her like his younger sister
97|Animation Number 145
97|Everyone thinks he's the only one for her,
97|and, of course, not like an older sister either——
97|Animation Number 145
97|but it's really the opposite.
97|I think that was around last month...
97|Oh, no, it's already November, so the month before last.
97|What's problematic for me now is, "How does Nadeko-chan, knowing Onii-chan has a girlfriend,
97|continue to be in love with him?"
97|P-Problematic...
97|What, you're saying it's not?
97|B-Because I don't really...
97|I don't really plan on stealing him away, and it's not even like I could.
97|If he says he has a girlfriend, I have no intent of troubling him...
97|Just being in love is enough for me...
97|Animation Number 159
97|That's what I'm saying is the problem!
97|It's so obvious you love him, yet you don't want to go steady or be lovers with him.
97|I have no idea what you're talking about.
97|In other words, to you, he's like just some TV star,
97|I love him as a member of the opposite sex,
97|Animation Number 168
97|or a hero from manga.
97|so can I really stop at that?
97|Animation Number 170
97|Someone you long for but never get? Is that it?
97|"Stop at that"...
97|Animation Number 174
97|That doesn't mean
97|Animation Number 174
97|that my feelings are fledgling.
97|Animation Number 174
97|I'm saying that sounds uncertain.
97|For someone that's been in love since the 2nd grade, you're being awfully acquiescent.
97|But if I start thinking that's the way things are, you'll invite him over, entice him with skimpy outfits,
97|lie out on the bed, act assertively, and pretend you don't know he has a girlfriend.
97|And yet, you're not giving up on him, and you seem happy when you make him worry about you.
97|I-It doesn't make me happy...
97|If I can be blunt about the impression I'm getting...
97|Let's see...
97|She's telling me I
97|Animation Number 186
97|It feels like a romance you know will never come to fruition, and thus reassured, you keep it up.
97|love someone
97|Animation Number 186
97|and to never change that
97|Animation Number 186
97|She's telling me I love someone out of reach
97|Animation Number 186
97|or entirely fictitious
97|Animation Number 186
97|just so that I won't be hurt
97|Animation Number 186
97|Loving someone who won't turn you down
97|Animation Number 186
97|sure is
97|Animation Number 186
97|the easy way out
97|Animation Number 186
97|Thanks to you being in love with him, life's been pretty easy for you up until now, right?
97|Wh-What do you mean?
97|I mean, it was easy for you to decline when some other boy asked you out, right?
97|Because you could say, "I'm in love with someone else."
97|Actually I
97|Animation Number 192
97|turned down a confession from a boy on the baseball team
97|Animation Number 192
97|Tsukihi-chan, I merely want to avoid troubling Koyomi-oniichan.
97|Trouble?
97|Y-Yeah... I-I think I said it earlier too, but trouble is something I don't want...
97|O-Or is that a bad thing? Am I not allowed to continue just being in love with him?
97|Of course, I know that there's no way to cause any trouble to him, either.
97|There's no way I'd win against her.
97|If I were a boy... no, even as a girl...
97|when I hear those assertions of yours, Nadeko-chan, I of course think "How cute."
97|"Petty, but admirable and cute."
97|You know how people buy lottery tickets? Even though such a thing is very rarely a winner?
97|Yet, if you ask them why they buy the tickets despite that, they say "I'm buying my dreams."
97|That's
97|Animation Number 210
97|a major
97|Animation Number 210
97|thing
97|Animation Number 210
97|Every time I hear that, I can't help but think...
97|"Buy reality."
97|I think when people say, "follow your dreams," it really means "look at reality."
97|Reference
97|The stationary glittering in her right hand is...
97|Animation Number 212
97|If you were actually going to confess to Onii-chan...
97|If you were planning on fighting her, I was thinking about cheering for you.
97|At the least, I would've stayed quiet and observed the battle. I always thought that until now...
97|But I've had enough. I'm bored of this.
97|I'll end it all for you.

97|I ask for your attention.
97|Animation Number 231
97|One, two,
97|Animation Number 233
97|I don't remember what happened afterward.
97|It's vague. It's uncertain.
97|Impossible...
97|Beware of Rail Crossing
97|Impossible, impossible, impossible...
97|No, no. Having escaped from reality, that's inevitable, Nadeko-chan. Huh?
97|Relax. You're cute enough.
97|Cu...
97|Cu?
97|I am not cute!
97|Nanahyakuichi Middle School / Entrance
97|Animation Number 264
97|A girl I've never seen before.
97|Animation Number 266
97|Like I said, not cute.
97|A new style.
97|Animation Number 267
97|It's just if...
97|Suddenly the serpent had
97|Scene 268
97|It's just if you really think about your bangs that much...
97|I'm not against fixing them for you. What do you say, huh?
97|Y-You can do such a thing?
97|I'm a god. If you can get my vessel back for me,
97|it's not like I wouldn't grant a simple wish like growing out bangs.
97|I see...
97|No, no, Nadeko-chan. You might be able to find it as early as tonight.
97|My vessel, that is.
97|What do you mean?
97|Thanks to Koyomi-oniichan trying to set you on the right path,
97|I got a clue as to where my vessel is.
97|Kuchinawa-san, that clue is...
97|Oh, I'm going to shut up.
97|Sengoku...
97|Sasayabu-sensei
97|Animation Number 283
97|Hmm?
97|I-I seem to have mistaken you for someone else. Sorry.
97|He begins to leave in confusion
97|Animation Number 285
97|Oh, it's me, Sengoku.
97|I'm Sengoku Nadeko.
97|Sengoku, is that what you really look like?
97|He coughs
97|Animation Number 288
97|It's obviously fake
97|Animation Number 288
97|Sengoku, what happened with that case I asked you about earlier? Any new developments?
97|Like I usually did, I lowered my eyes, looked down, and stayed quiet.
97|Having done so, let's wait for Sasayabu-sensei to become unsettled and walk away.
97|And length of time aside,
97|Animation Number 292
97|it's likely never going to get solved.
97|Animation Number 292
97|Going on standby.
97|Animation Number 292
97|Why is it?
97|Has something changed between yesterday and today?
97|Of course! It has to be my hairstyle.
97|Even with my eyes closed and looking down...
97|Black Scene
97|Animation Number 'none'
97|Sasayabu-sensei has a clear view of my face...
97|If he can see my facial expressions, it's obvious to him that I'm not troubled so much.
97|I have no choice.
97|Let's make up some likely excuse and get through this scene.
97|For starters, like I usually do...
97|Let's go with that.
97|Animation Number 301
97|Bangs or no bangs, like I always do,
97|start off with "I'm sorry," and take it from there...
97|I wonder if a normal excuse will do it.
97|Animation Number 302
97|Shut the hell up!
97|Wait. Did someone just say something?
97|Of course there aren't any new developments! Don't go forcing all your work on me, huh?
97|Every time you look at my face, it's "What happened to that case? What happened to that case?"
97|Like anything would ever happen! No way!
97|You know more than anyone else that you're asking for the impossible! Don't ya, huh?
97|Wh-What's the matter, Sengoku?
97|Don't get all chummy and touch me!
97|What do you think people are, dolls or something?
97|Hah!
97|I know I'm just a cute girl. No matter what people say, I just do as I'm told!
97|But that doesn't mean I don't have any emotions!
97|Don't assume the quiet ones are really quiet!
97|H-Hey, Sengoku-san, what's wrong?
97|Calm down. Come on, just calm down.
97|You're probably just tired.
97|Calm down? This is from being calm for so long...
97|And I'm tired? Can't you tell just by looking?
97|Se-Sengoku, I just believed in your sense of duty...
97|Like I have any sense of duty!
97|You shoulda seen that Sengoku Nadeko is a good-for-nothing!
97|Don't be fooled by looks! Get a grip!
97|That's right, I got nothing going for me except being cute!
97|Don't go believing someone like this!
97|This is contrary to everything I ever did.
97|Animation Number 340
97|Wh-Where are you going, Sengoku?
97|Huh?
97|Isn't it obvious? I gotta do it, so I'm gonna go do my job as Class Prez for ya!
97|You're the one that forced it on me! Rejoice, you idiot!

97|Animation Number 'none'
97|All right, guys, look at reality!
97|I yelled.
97|Animation Number 369
97|All of you are moping about things past, and wasting precious time as adolescents.
97|I talked on——
97|Animation Number 370
97|Do you guys realize how pointless all that is?
97|Countless times
97|Animation Number 371
97|If who you thought was a friend was jealous of ya, that's enough to end the friendship?
97|Is it all over if someone lies to ya?
97|You've gotta come to terms at some point, or stuff like this goes on forever!
97|Maybe you're just
97|Animation Number 372
97|lying low,
97|Animation Number 372
97|trying to change classes in April,
97|Animation Number 372
97|carrying the memory forever!
97|Animation Number 372
97|Then it's no good unless you paint over those memories! Overwrite them!
97|Change them into memories of "I couldn't trust anyone because
97|of these weird charms, but we all made up in the end"!
97|Yeah, you guys are the worst bunch ever!
97|Hypocrites that talk principles and hide your real intentions!
97|Scum of the earth that betray once someone believes you! The lowest forms of life on Earth!
97|But... But there musta been some truth somewhere in there!
97|I yelled from the bottom of my heart.
97|Animation Number 378
97|Maybe there was a bit of truth inside that lie!
97|Lies! Betrayal! Deception! Hypocrisy!
97|Why don't any of you have a heart big enough to forgive all that! Huh?
97|Since when are you so great that you can cherry-pick the people around you?
97|Don't hang out with people based on whether you like them or not!
97|I said one last thing. I yelled it.
97|Animation Number 384
97|I hate all of you! But god damn it, you're all my classmates!
97|I left school early. I did, indeed.
97|I'm just walking around absentmindedly.
97|I'm even more absentminded than when I went to school.
97|No, now that I think about it, the walk to school was fun.
97|Back then, what in the world was troubling my mind?
97|I had no idea where I was going.
97|Animation Number 393
97|Really,
97|Animation Number 393
97|am I going?
97|Animation Number 393
97|You know, I'm going to bring up something that should be clear as water, Nadeko-chan.
97|That tirade earlier... It wasn't that I took over your body and said whatever was on my mind.
97|Simply put, the effects of you assimilating me showed up pretty clearly...
97|It's just that the restraints you usually have on happened to disappear.
97|I already know that. Shut up...
97|It was Nadeko. None other than Sengoku Nadeko...
97|It was Nadeko herself. It was just Nadeko saying what she wanted to say.
97|I know that. It's not that you're to blame, Kuchinawa-san.
97|Yeah, that's right. Since you understand...
97|But I do think it is your fault, Kuchinawa-san.
97|For now, my life and my days at school have come to an "ending."
97|I try to change the topic.
97|Animation Number 403
97|So now, once and for all, let's end it, Kuchinawa-san.
97|Huh?
97|You have a clue as to where your vessel is, right, Kuchinawa-san?
97|Let's hurry up and find it, Kuchinawa-san, and have you regain your original powers. And then...
97|...let's bid farewell.
97|That will be the end of it all. Sound good?
97|I can't think about the rest.
97|Animation Number 410
97|Nothing comes to mind.
97|Animation Number 410
97|Sure. Sounds fine.
97|Then, tell me, Kuchinawa-san. Where should I go, and where should I look?
97|You should look in Koyomi-oniichan's house.
97|The ending to everything is there.
97|Sealed up space means nothing against me!
97|I am a being that nullifies all sorts of barriers!
97|But it's still mysterious...
97|Why is your vessel inside Koyomi-oniichan's house, Kuchinawa-san?
97|My vessel was probably just carried away,
97|found by someone, and entrusted to Koyomi-oniichan.
97|Entrusted? By whom?
97|Who knows? Probably that specialist that wears Hawaiian shirts or something?
97|It's just a thought.
97|What Tsukihi-chan was saying is probably right.
97|Huh?
97|The reason why I'm in love with Koyomi-oniichan. It's because if I am, I don't have to get hurt.
97|See, romance takes a whole lot of energy, right?

97|Falling in love with someone, someone falling for you...
97|Sometimes it's easier if you keep pining for a love that will never be yours.
97|You don't have to look for someone else or choose.
97|It's like Tsukihi-chan said.
97|Otherwise, you can't explain it, after all...
97|Someone half-hearted like me continuing to be in love for six years
97|with a friend's older brother whom I've barely gotten to know.
97|It's just unreasonable, right?
97|If I were to force a reason...
97|I'd say that it was because he was Araragi Koyomi.
97|In other words, though it's not a phrase you'd normally use for a man
97|I have to say I felt relieved being in love with someone as unattainable as the stars.
97|A dream that remains unfulfilled.

97|Hey, Nadeko-chan?
97|A-Amazing! What a rabid fetish...
97|That's Koyomi-oniichan all right. Nothing half-hearted!
97|No, but this, all in all...
97|Hey, Nadeko-chan.
97|Hush. Maybe your vessel is hidden between the pages of a book like this.
97|Nadeko-chan!
97|Wh-What? Something about the girl on this page?
97|No, not that... I meant that bookmark that was placed between those pages.
97|Bookmark?
97|Wait, this isn't a bookmark, but a talisman?
97|So that's how it is.
97|So that's how it was preserved.
97|To think that my vessel wasn't preserved as a physical item, but as a drawing...
97|I didn't expect that, heh...
97|The serpent had never been in this good a mood.
97|Animation Number 460
97|Here, Nadeko-chan. Hurry up and feed me that talisman.
97|Feed?
97|Rest assured, I'll keep my promise. I'll make sure you have your bangs back.
97|No, that won't be enough of a reward. If you have other wishes I'll grant them.
97|What? You don't have any wishes, Nadeko-chan? I don't care if they're overly ambitious.
97|Overly ambitious...
97|Unattainable as the stars...
97|A wish.
97|What, you don't have it? Something that you'd want to wish upon a god?
97|Something I want to wish...
97|Something you'd want to pray for, if you will.
97|"My beloved..."
97|"My beloved Koyomi-oniichan, I want our feelings to become mutual."
97|Would a wish like that come true, I wonder?
97|That one won't come true, Sengoku.

97|We're the Fire Sisters!!
97|Decoy
97|It's already been 2 years since we started helping people with our combined power.

97|Quiz!
97|There's this saying: "The good you do for others is good you do yourself"; however...
97|However?
97|I hear children often misinterpret it on purpose as:
97|"Never show compassion to others".
97|You will pay for doing that to our friend!
97|Yeah, tell me about it.
97|What it really means though is that when you help people,
97|you're not doing it for them, you're doing it for yourself.
97|But in that case, doesn't it mean that helping people for your own sake is not necessarily wrong?
97|You were a fool for trusting him as well, Nadeko-chan.
97|Tsukihi-chan is scary when she snaps!
97|Punishment!
97|You don't even take the other person into consideration because your only goal is to feel good about yourself.
97|Right, another terrible way to look at it.
97|Makes you wonder when you help somebody, are you doing it for them or for yourself?
97|While I was at it, I gave you a new look!
97|Eh!
97|Is that an act of virtue or hypocrisy?
97|Thinking about that would just stop you in your tracks.
97|So in the end, compassion exists to make people hesitate.
97|It's quite a good thing after all.
97|I'm not sure it can be considered good...

98|Yup.
98|Atoning.
98|I wasn't a victim.
98|Actually,

98|I'm overwhelmingly alone.
98|I'm the only one left standing.
98|The other two have collapsed.
98|You shouldn't have come after me.
98|Too weak.
98|At the end of the day,
98|what kind of story is this anyway,
98|Serpent?
98|Come on, Nadeko.
98|Haven't I been telling you that you're to blame for everything?
98|Well ?
98|The serpent answers me as usual.
98|With a cynical tone, almost like he was picking a fight with me.
98|Yeah.
98|"Usual"? What a strange word to use.
98|Snake
98|Scene no. 153
98|This serpent oddity is a god that only revived when I ate that talisman a few hours ago.
98|A white snake
98|Scene no. 153
98|The serpent
98|Scene no. 153
98|That's when this oddity was born.
98|Until then, it only existed in my mind.
98|Normally, that'd be enough.
98|Oddities and gods only exist within each individual's mind to begin with.
98|This mental image you've given me is enough belief by itself.
98|Belief?
98|Are you saying that I went and made up this serpent oddity, using this image in my mind?
98|And that way, you revived the belief in me that had died out a long time ago all by yourself.
98|I have to say, your delusions are amazing.
98|Those words struck deep.
98|Scene no. 161
98|Delusions...
98|So the serpent I thought was my partner really was just me seeing and hearing things, huh?
98|Pretending to hear the voice of God
98|Scene no. 162
98|sounds like
98|Scene no. 162
98|I think I'm Joan of Arc.
98|Then it's only natural that I knew what I'd touched inside a shoe locker I couldn't even see—
98|only natural that I knew it was a white snake.
98|I mean, there's no way I wouldn't know my own delusions.
98|Black
98|Unnumbered Scene
98|The reason the white snakes only appeared from airtight containers,
98|Scene no. 167
98|Such an absurd anecdote, isn't it?
98|and the reason the snake could not leave the shrine
98|Scene no. 167
98|Actually...
98|were exceedingly simple.
98|Scene no. 167
98|it's not just an anecdote, but a story.
98|Otherwise the coherence of my delusion would have fallen apart.
98|Scene no. 167
98|But look, you actually revived me, a god, with those delusions of yours.
98|That is amazing.
98|Scene no. 168
98|Snake Snake Snake
98|In other words, Nadeko,
98|you fabricated a story to do that.
98|Fabricated a story...
98|In reality, you were merely living a life not worth telling as a story.
98|Escapism is your strong suit, and I guess this was your greatest escape.
98|But...
98|Vain Struggle
98|Scene no. 177
98|You say you were my delusion until now,
98|but you knew things that I didn't know about.
98|That's impossible.
98|I was just your delusion, so I didn't know any more than you did at the time.
98|Th-Then why?
98|You've simply forgotten about it, is all.
98|Back in June, when you were trying to dispel the charm placed on you,
98|you browsed through books at a bookstore and gained a fair amount of specialized knowledge.
98|Human memory knows no true oblivion.
98|Scene no. 181
98|No matter how hard we try to forget, everything remains in our mind.
98|Scene no. 181
98|We are not meant to forget our sins.
98|Scene no. 181
98|I'm quite confused right now.
98|Could you tell me, Serpent?
98|How did things end up this way?
98|After so much
98|Scene no. 185
98|You know how, right?
98|I was done running away from reality.
98|Scene no. 185
98|There was no need to run away anymore either.
98|Scene no. 185
98|You know now, right?
98|Now that you're not a delusion.
98|Now that you've truly revived.
98|But that's also exactly why one could call this a ridiculous conversation.
98|Because right now, the serpent and I are one and the same.
98|Because this has gone beyond delusions or possession.
98|Because we share the same identity.
98|Because the serpent that was sealed away in that talisman revived when I swallowed it whole.
98|Because I am the serpent.
98|So what happens from here on in is pretty much a monologue.
98|As is established practice.
98|White
98|Unnumbered Scene
98|Does that mean my delusions started when I saw a white snake in that shoe locker?
98|That's a bit off the mark.
98|If you want to know when it started, it was around the start of the month before last.
98|The month before last?
98|The beginning of September?
98|When September began,
98|Scene no. 199
98|Around the time you found out that Koyomi had a girlfriend.
98|The time you saw him walking with a girl he seemed to be on close terms with.
98|That was the beginning for you.
98|No.
98|Maybe it was the end.
98|The end.
98|Scene no. 205
98|Just like your friends did to you in the past,
98|you simply envied that girlfriend of his.
98|Scene no. 208
98|And then what did I do?
98|You hit upon the same idea your friends did.
98|You can tell, right?
98|The same thing?
98|Basically,
98|you prayed to God.
98|To God?
98|Ever since you found out that Koyomi had a girlfriend,
98|Purity in Spirit
98|you visited this shrine every chance you got.
98|Don't you remember that at all?
98|No.
98|So I prayed to God a hundred times?
98|You didn't actually come here a hundred times.
98|Simply praying to God normally stands a very low chance of success.
98|That's what one would think.
98|But you're different.
98|Because in June, at this very shrine, you exorcised the charm a friend had placed on you.
98|"Meet an oddity, and you'll be drawn to them."
98|Pulled in
98|Scene no. 222
98|Is this what those words actually mean?
98|In other words, "Know an oddity, and you'll believe in them."
98|by a snake.
98|Scene no. 225
98|By a venomous snake.
98|Scene no. 225
98|Oh, I see.
98|Got bitten
98|Scene no. 225
98|I found out at that time that praying to God works.
98|God-bidden
98|Scene no. 225
98|But even if that were the case, it should've been pointless to do so here, right?
98|I mean, this shrine
98|Scene no. 229
98|was abandoned.
98|Scene no. 230
98|A shrine that has lost all religious value.
98|There was no God here, after all.
98|Yeah.
98|And the girl named Oshino Ougi pointed that out to you...
98|that morning.
98|30th of October
98|By the way, Nadeko.
98|I've happened to spot you there often.
98|It looks like you've been visiting that shrine frequently.
98|I don't know what you're praying for,
98|but it won't work.
98|Didn't you know?
98|There is no god at that shrine.
98|Though, well, it's a different story if the body comes back.
98|By the way, that body's currently in Araragi's possession.
98|Gaen Izuko entrusted him with it just a few months ago.
98|I bet it's somewhere in the Araragi residence.
98|Knowing him, he probably just squirreled it away somewhere simple.
98|Scene no. 242
98|Somewhere simple
98|Scene no. 242
98|If that God were to revive—
98|if he were to be unsealed—
98|I bet he'd be more than willing to grant your wish.
98|I do, really.
98|Black
98|Unnumbered Scene
98|How to unseal him?
98|Don't ask me.
98|It's a snake god, so maybe you could have a random snake swallow it, I guess?
98|You know that lame scrunchie?
98|That high school girl gave it to you that morning as a "token of friendship."
98|If you'd had that long of a conversation...
98|...then of course it'd feel like time had flown by.
98|So that spurred me on to fabricate a story, huh?
98|"Atoning for the sin I committed by killing all those snakes" was nothing but a convenient excuse for me.
98|Scene no. 258
98|It was a story I made up so I could look for the talisman in Koyomi's room—the serpent's body.
98|Scene no. 260
98|I even took advantage of my sins for that reason.
98|Scene no. 261
98|I tried to revive a god in order to have my selfish wish granted.
98|Scene no. 263
98|I conjured up the voice of God in order to revive him.
98|Scene no. 266
98|Rather than seeing illusions, I was averting my eyes from reality...
98|using a story I'd made up as a decoy.
98|as a decoy
98|Scene no. 271
98|In truth, I was plotting the restoration of God.
98|But what about that time you opened the front door of Koyomi's place from the inside?
98|You just used the key.
98|The previous day, you made sure your parents would realize that you left home
98|and made sure that information would find its way to Tsukihi and Koyomi.
98|What do you think all that was for?
98|You did it so you could get into the Araragi residence and borrow the key.
98|Of course, all that calculation, trespassing, and even larceny was in vain as Koyomi and Shinobu caught me red-handed.
98|I'm probably not cut out to be a thief.
98|I'm probably not cut out for anything.
98|Because I always averted my eyes.
98|Scene no. 281
98|Oh, please.
98|You succeeded in reviving me, so you are cut out for something.
98|Cut out for what?
98|To be a god.
98|I'm not kidding.
98|You're a god now, you know.
98|You freed me from being sealed in that talisman and revived me,
98|using your body as the vessel.
98|Perhaps
98|Scene no. 288
98|the moral of the story was that we should work by ourselves
98|Scene no. 288
98|to make our wishes come true.
98|Scene no. 288
98|You shouldn't rely on God.
98|Scene no. 288
98|I paid heed to or ignored people's words, twisted the truth, and even deceived myself for my own convenience, huh?
98|Everybody does that.
98|But it's only natural, right?
98|It is what it is.
98|Scene no. 293
98|Nothing could be done.
98|It couldn't have ended any other way.
98|Scene no. 293
98|Everyone holds themselves precious.
98|And I did too, is all.
98|By playing the victim, yeah.
98|Victims and aggressors can trade places in the blink of the eye.
98|It all just depends on circumstances and standpoints.
98|It doesn't matter whether you focus on the aggressor or the victim.
98|Because it's all the same thing.
98|and only struck her.
98|Scene no. 298
98|I was quiet.
98|Scene no. 299
98|Er...
98|Was there anything else I didn't understand?
98|Oh, right.
98|Why did Koyomi come back home right when I was searching his room?
98|If only that hadn't happened...
98|Maybe it was pure coincidence.
98|Maybe he came back home and just happened to run into you.
98|Q-Quite the convenient train of thought, I must say.
98|Like a little girl...
98|Scene no. 303
98|That doesn't explain why I, nocturnal as I am, was running about during the day.
98|Boy, did that niece wannabe ever pull a fast one on us.
98|I can finally hear the voice of that scrunchie.
98|It was all her doing, huh?
98|I silenced her.
98|Huh?
98|That's weird. She's still moving.
98|Scene no. 307
98|Guess I have to fix that.
98|Slash. Slash. Slash. Slash. Slash. Slash.
98|Scene no. 308
98|She stopped moving. She stopped moving.
98|Scene no. 309
98|Whatever. I don't care.

98|Should we kill Koyomi, then?

98|Unnumbered Scene
98|Huh? You okay with that?
98|Isn't that what they call "putting the cart before the horse"?
98|Yeah, but I don't have a choice, do I?
98|I bet he'd keep getting girlfriends and lovers as long as he stays alive.
98|I don't want to deal with a broken heart each time.
98|Of course, his girlfriend, being his girlfriend, would soon be deceased...
98|Scene no. 313
98|If I'm going to stay in a love that will never come true,
98|wouldn't having Koyomi die make it that much more romantic?
98|Likewise, I didn't want to make more trouble for him than I already had.
98|Scene no. 314
98|That's how insane you've become, eh?
98|Nothing I can do about that.
98|I am an oddity, after all.
98|But that was the Nadeko of the past,
98|not me as I am now!

98|Unnumbered Scene
98|Looking at the call,
98|Scene no. 332
98|I changed my mind.
98|Scene no. 332
98|I felt strange.
98|Scene no. 332
98|Hello.
98|Sengoku Nadeko speaking.
98|Hello.
98|This is Senjougahara Hitagi.
98|I'd heard the name before.
98|Scene no. 335
98|Good day, Sengoku. Is my man still alive?
98|For now. Just barely.
98|Of course I had.
98|Scene no. 338
98|Oh, good.
98|That means I just barely made it in time.
98|Why don't you make a deal with me?
98|A deal?
98|You can kill me, so could you spare Araragi in return?
98|And if she's still alive, Shinobu too.
98|I wondered what Senjougahara could be thinking about.
98|Scene no. 344
98|I quickly stopped wondering.
98|Scene no. 344
98|I didn't care.
98|Scene no. 344
98|Nope.
98|I'll kill Koyomi
98|and you.
98|I'll also kill Shinobu.
98|Those were my intentions all along, so you can't even call that a deal.
98|I see. Too bad.
98|Very well.
98|In that case, let me give you some advice as someone older than you.
98|You should give careful thought to the order in which you kill the three of us.
98|Killing Araragi before Shinobu is out of the question.
98|If you do, that'll cancel the link between the two of them and give Shinobu her legendary vampire powers back.
98|You'll get gobbled up in an instant.
98|Yeah, you're right.
98|I got it.
98|She was right.
98|Scene no. 353
98|Thank your for your advice—
98|Scene no. 353
98|And you should kill me first, before you even get to that point.
98|February, 1919
98|Donor
98|If you don't, not only will I kill you,
98|Scene no. 355
98|but I'll kill everyone.
98|E-Everyone?
98|Everyone.
98|You shouldn't underestimate my anger.
98|Okay.
98|I'll start with you, then.
98|I have to kill Shinobu after that, and Koyomi last, right?
98|Thank you.
98|You have to thank the people who are nice to you.
98|Scene no. 359
98|People who are nice to me are nice people.
98|Scene no. 359
98|No need to thank me.
98|In return, could you do me a favor?
98|You're now a god to be revered—
98|Purity in Spirit
98|the lord of that shrine,
98|so you can listen to the request of a mere mortal like me, right?
98|I'll listen to it, at least.
98|Curiosity piqued.
98|Scene no. 364
98|You can kill the three of us in that order.
98|But could you give us a little time before you do?
98|Time?
98|Now that you're an oddity,
98|Scene no. 367
98|Like a day,
98|won't you live
98|Scene no. 367
98|or two,
98|forever,
98|a week,
98|provided people worship you?
98|Scene no. 367
98|a month,
98|or maybe half a year.
98|"Half a year,"
98|Scene no. 369
98|was where I felt a difference in her voice.
98|Scene no. 369
98|Shouldn't be a problem for you.
98|If your intent to kill is real, that is.
98|If it's real, and not some fleeting desire, you should be able to wait.
98|Half a year?
98|What happens in half a year?
98|Graduation.
98|Graduation?
98|Okay.
98|I'll wait half a year.
98|I see.
98|Thank you very much.
98|Half a year.
98|To be more precise, I'll wait until graduation.
98|Once the ceremony's over, I want you to come to the Shrine of the Polar Snake right away.
98|I'll be waiting for you.
98|And during that time, you're not allowed to hold hands with Koyomi or anything, all right?
98|On the other end of the line,
98|Scene no. 381
98|My, that would certainly leave me in limboa.
98|I felt like Senjougahara was smiling.
98|Scene no. 381
98|It was no laughing matter.
98|Scene no. 383
98|If...
98|If we'd met each other in a different manner,
98|the two of us might've been able to become friends.
98|No. That wouldn't have happened.
98|I'm sorry, but I hate cute brats like you more than I hate my past self,
98|Sengoku Nadeko.
98|Don't worry, I'll always remember your voice
98|Here's the path where I ran toward you
98|This is the sky I admired
98|Here we spend the time of our life
98|Will you laugh?
98|Will you be angry?
98|I just can't give up, and you're probably going to be angry with me
98|Countless times
98|I consider the possibility of just wanting you
98|(forevermore)
98|I still want a lie to deceive me
98|Come on, forgive me,
98|because my feelings are so chaotic
98|Yeah, I want you to know
98|that the life you found past despair is real
98|Don't forget that
98|Scene no. 396
98|No timeskip. Sorry.
98|Scene no. 396
98|No spoilers either.
98|Scene no. 396
98|Isn't the story over anyway?
98|Scene no. 396
98|Sengoku Nadeko became a god.
98|That is all.
98|This is a story that should've ended with that one line.
98|That said, it isn't like one of the snakes I killed in the past—
98|it wouldn't be nice to chop off the ending like that.
98|So instead of an epilogue,
98|let's finish things off with a trailer.
98|Trailer.
98|Scene no. 405
98|Trailer!
98|Half a year later, on a certain day in March,
98|on the day of Naoetsu Private High School's graduation ceremony,
98|I wait at the Shrine of the Polar Snake.
98|My face is clearly visible from the front.
98|That is to say, I'm looking straight ahead.
98|I don't intend to hide it.
98|Because to me, Sengoku Nadeko, this is the day I bid farewell to humanity.
98|Scene no. 418
98|This will also be the last day I use my eyes to see.
98|That's right.
98|At the very least, I want myself to be that resolute as I wait...
98|for them.
98|Araragi Koyomi,
98|Oshino Shinobu,
98|Senjougahara Hitagi,
98|and it'd be amazing if Kanbaru and Hanekawa could make it too.
98|You can't call it a promise,
98|Scene no. 439
98|but behind those three
98|Scene no. 439
98|We'd have the entire party here!
98|I couldn't get better last boss treatment if I tried.
98|That said, even if they all came at me,
98|I don't believe for one second that I'd lose.
98|And if the final battle begins with me barking out a catchphrase like this, there'd be nothing like it.

99|That's more dangerous than you think. You can still turn back now.
99|B-But, Koyomi-oniichan... I-I have to do "something" with this.
99|Because, for me, it's atonement.

99|There's no need to worry over such an obstinate, spoiled brat.
99|All you have to do is punch her and snatch it.

99|I'm alone.
99|I am overwhelmingly alone. I am the only one standing.
99|The other two have fallen.
99|It would've been better if they hadn't chased after me.
99|Too weak.
99|What kind of story was this in the end, anyway? Well, Kuchinawa-san?
99|I've been saying it's all your fault, Nadeko-chan. Haven't I, huh?
99|Kuchinawa-san answers. Cynical as usual. As if he was picking a fight with me.
99|No, "as usual" is a weird way of putting it.
99|Snake
99|Animation Number 153
99|This aberration called "Kuchinawa-san" is a god that was revived just several hours ago when I ate that talisman.
99|A white snake
99|Animation Number 153
99|Until just now, such an aberration had not existed.
99|He didn't exist but within my heart.
99|That's essentially enough, though.
99|Aberrations—even gods—don't exist but within each individual in the first place.
99|This image you forced onto me is enough of a faith already.
99|Faith... In other words, I accidentally created the aberration "Kuchinawa-san"...
99|...with just that arbitrary image I formed in my mind?
99|And thus you single-handedly revived a faith which perished long ago.
99|Talk about an amazing delusion!
99|Those words struck deep.
99|Animation Number 161
99|Delusion... In other words, the Kuchinawa-san I thought was my partner...
99|...was really a hallucination, both visually and aurally?

99|sounds like
99|Animation Number 162
99|Why I knew by touch, even though I couldn't see inside my shoe rack due to the angle...
99|...that it was a snake, and a white one at that, has an obvious explanation.
99|Because it was my own delusion; there's no way I wouldn't know.
99|Black Scene
99|Animation Number 'none'
99|This is all a rather silly tale.
99|No, not just a tale... this is an actual story.
99|Well still, with that you actually revived a god, me, so you're really something.
99|Nadeko, to summarize, for that purpose, you fabricated a story.
99|Fabricated a story...
99|The real Nadeko-chan had been living a life that had no prospect of becoming an actual story.
99|As one adept at escaping reality, this was your biggest escape.
99|But...

99|You say that the Kuchinawa-san up to now was just my delusion, but...
99|You knew things I didn't, Kuchinawa-san.
99|Impossible, just impossible. It was your delusion, so at that time I didn't possess any knowledge you didn't.
99|Th-Then how...
99|You're just forgetting it all.
99|In June, you were reading at the bookstore, in order to undo the charm placed on you...
99|...thus you have gained some specialized knowledge.
99|Human memory knows no true oblivion.
99|Animation Number 181
99|No matter how hard we try to forget, everything remains in our mind.
99|Animation Number 181
99|We are not meant to forget our sins.
99|Animation Number 181
99|I'm pretty confused about all this.
99|Can you tell me, Kuchinawa-san? What happened for things to end up like this?
99|It's clear to you, right, Kuchinawa-san..?
99|After so much
99|Animation Number 185
99|I was done running away from reality.
99|Animation Number 185
99|To the current Kuchinawa-san...
99|The not-Nadeko's-delusion, really-revived Kuchinawa-san.
99|But that's exactly why I think this conversation is utterly stupid.
99|Because the present Kuchinawa-san and I are on equal ground.
99|Because he surpassed delusion and possession, and became equal.
99|Because he revived from that talisman, which I swallowed whole, turning my body into the god's container.
99|Because Kuchinawa-san is me, Nadeko.
99|So from here on it's just something like a monologue. As usual.
99|White Scene
99|Animation Number 'none'
99|I wonder if my delusion started when I saw the white snake in the shoe rack?
99|Not quite. It was around the beginning of the month before last.
99|Two months ago... When September began?
99|When September began,
99|Animation Number 199
99|When you found out Koyomi-oniichan had a girlfriend.
99|When you saw him walking with his girlfriend in a very amiable manner.
99|That is "the beginning" for you.
99|No...
99|...rather, "the end."
99|Just like what your friend did to you, Nadeko-chan. You just got jealous of her. Of that girlfriend.
99|Envy.
99|Animation Number 208
99|And so, what did I do?
99|You had the same idea as that friend of yours. You know what that is, huh?
99|The same idea?
99|In other words.
99|You prayed to a god.
99|To a god?
99|Once you found out he had a girlfriend...
99|Purity in Spirit
99|...you came to pray at this shrine whenever you had time. You don't remember any of it?
99|I don't. In other words, the Hundred Worships ritual?
99|Though you haven't made so many as a hundred trips.
99|"Simply praying to a god... this probably won't work."
99|That's how everyone likely thinks. But not you, right?
99|Because in June, here in this shrine, you broke the magic charm placed on you by your friend.
99|"Meet an aberration and you'll be pulled in to them." Is that what that meant?
99|Pulled in
99|Animation Number 222
99|In other words, because I got to know of aberrations, I've come to believe in them.
99|I see. The fact that praying to a god worked was something I learned back then.
99|Got bitten
99|Animation Number 225
99|But even if that's the case, there would be no meaning for me to do such a thing here.
99|I mean, this shrine
99|Animation Number 229
99|A shrine that exhausted its faith, because there were no gods residing here.
99|Right. That morning, this fact was pointed out to you by that girl, Oshino Ougi.
99|30th of October
99|By the way, Nadeko-chan.
99|I happen to spot you often. And you seem to frequent that shrine.
99|And I don't know what you're praying for...
99|But it's useless.
99|That shrine doesn't have a god. Didn't you know?
99|If the vessel were returned, it would be a different story. And by the way, that object...
99|...is in Araragi-senpai's hands now.
99|Gaen Izuko-san entrusted him with it. Mere months ago.
99|It's somewhere in the Araragi residence, maybe?
99|Somewhere simple
99|Animation Number 242
99|If that god were revived... The seal broken...
99|I'm sure it could easily grant your wish, Nadeko-chan.
99|No, really.
99|Black Scene
99|Animation Number 'none'
99|How to break the seal? I wouldn't know.
99|Since it's a snake god, maybe you should grab some snake slithering around and get it to swallow it whole?
99|And that tasteless scrunchie was also something you got from that high school girl...
99|...as a "sign of making acquaintance." If you had that "deep of a conversation"...
99|...it would make sense that time would fly.
99|And with that as the catalyst, I had started the fabrication of a story.
99|Atonement for killing the snakes... Even things like that were merely believable excuses for me.
99|A story I created to find a talisman, Kuchinawa-san's vessel, in Koyomi-oniichan's room.
99|For the sake of that I used even my own sins.
99|For the sake of my own selfish wishes, I tried to revive a god.
99|For the sake of reviving a god, I fabricated the god's voice.
99|I wasn't just simply hallucinating. I was looking away from reality.
99|Using the story I created as a decoy...
99|...behind the scenes, I was plotting the god's reinstatement.
99|But how'd you unlock the door to Koyomi-oniichan's house from inside?
99|In reality, you just used a key.
99|Why do you think you left the house the night before in a way your parents would notice...
99|...so this information would reach Tsukihi and Koyomi-oniichan?
99|So you could enter the Araragi residence and "borrow" a key, of course.
99|Though, being that calculating and committing not only breaking and entering, but larceny as well...
99|Koyomi-oniichan and Shinobu-san found me out regardless.
99|It seems I'm not fit to be a thief.
99|I'm not fit for anything.
99|Because I always averted my eyes.
99|Animation Number 281
99|No, no... You properly revived me, so you're fit...
99|Fit for what?
99|A god.
99|Jokes aside, you are a god now, Nadeko-chan.
99|You revived me from my vessel, that talisman, turning your body into the god's container.
99|Perhaps
99|Animation Number 288
99|the moral of the story was that we should work by ourselves
99|Animation Number 288
99|to make our wishes come true.
99|Animation Number 288
99|I have been very conveniently listening to or ignoring what others say...
99|...twisting reality...
99|...and fooling myself.
99|Well, everyone is like that though.
99|But it couldn't be helped, right?
99|It is what it is.
99|Animation Number 293
99|Nothing could be done.
99|It couldn't have ended any other way.
99|Animation Number 293
99|Everyone thinks about themselves. It's just that I was like that too.
99|...By playing the victim, huh?
99|Victims and culprits can easily swap places.
99|It's all about the standpoint and circumstances.
99|Seeing the culprit as important... Seeing the victim as important... They're all the same thing.
99|and only struck her.
99|Animation Number 298
99|I was quiet.
99|Animation Number 299
99|Um, is there anything else I don't understand yet?
99|Oh, right. When Koyomi-oniichan returned while I was rummaging about...
99|...it was such good timing. How'd he do it the first place? If only he hadn't...
99|Just a coincidence maybe?
99|Like, "he just came home and happened to run into you."
99|S-
99|Such a convenient way of thinking.
99|That wouldn't explain why my nocturnal self was able to stay active during daylight hours.
99|That niece pretender has one up on me.
99|Finally I can hear what that scrunchie says.
99|But to think, everything was to her arrangement, huh?
99|She stopped moving. She stopped moving.
99|Animation Number 309
99|Oh well, it doesn't matter.
99|Black Scene
99|Animation Number 'none'
99|Let's go kill Koyomi-oniichan.
99|Red Scene
99|Animation Number 'none'
99|Huh? Is that all right? Isn't that mistaking the means for the end?
99|But it can't be helped, right?
99|If he stays alive, Koyomi-oniichan will keep making girlfriends and lovers.
99|It'd be exhausting to be heartbroken each time.
99|If I mean to have an unrequited love...
99|...it'd be a lot more romantic if he were dead, wouldn't it?
99|Likewise, I didn't want to make more trouble for him than I already had.
99|Animation Number 314
99|So your insanity is already at that level...
99|It can't be helped.
99|Since Nadeko is an aberration...
99|But that's "Nadeko,"
99|Not "me"!
99|Black Scene
99|Animation Number 'none'
99|Looking at the call,
99|Animation Number 332
99|I changed my mind.
99|Animation Number 332
99|I felt strange.
99|Animation Number 332
99|Hello, Sengoku Nadeko here.
99|Hello, Senjougahara Hitagi here.
99|I'd heard the name before.
99|Animation Number 335
99|Good day, Sengoku-san. Is my guy still alive?
99|For now. Barely.
99|Of course I had.
99|Animation Number 338
99|I see. Good. Looks like I barely made it in time.
99|Sengoku-san, let's make a deal.
99|A deal?
99|You can kill me, so can you spare Araragi-kun? And if she's still alive, spare Shinobu-san too.
99|I wondered what Senjougahara could be thinking about.
99|Animation Number 344
99|I quickly stopped wondering.
99|Animation Number 344
99|Can't.
99|I'll kill Koyomi-oniichan and you too. Shinobu-san as well.
99|I planned to from the start, so I can't make a deal like that.
99|Oh, that's a shame. It can't be helped, then.
99|Then I'll give you some advice as someone with more life experience.
99|You should think hard about the order in which you kill those three, which includes me.
99|You absolutely can't kill Araragi-kun before Shinobu-san.
99|If you do, her link to him will be broken...
99|...and she'll regain her original powers as a legendary vampire. She'll eat up someone like you in no time.
99|Yeah, you're right. Got it.
99|She was right.
99|Animation Number 353
99|Thank your for your advice—
99|Animation Number 353
99|And before that, you should kill me first and foremost.
99|Or not only will I kill you...
99|February, 1919
99|Donor
99|Animation Number 355
99|...I'll kill everyone.
99|E-Everyone?
99|Everyone, yes. Don't take the venting of my anger lightly.
99|All right. Then the order I should kill in is: you first, then Shinobu-san, and Koyomi-oniichan last, right?
99|Thanks.
99|You have to thank the people who are nice to you.
99|Animation Number 359
99|People who are nice to me are nice people.
99|Animation Number 359
99|You don't need to thank me. But in return, Sengoku-san, can I ask you one favor?
99|You are now a god that should be worshipped. The owner of that shrine.
99|Purity in Spirit
99|I think you can listen to the general populace's wishes, like mine, right?
99|I'll listen, but no more.
99|Curiosity piqued.
99|Animation Number 364
99|You can kill us in that order. But before you do, can you give us a little bit of time?
99|Time?
99|Like a day, two days, a week, a month...
99|Now that you're an aberration,
99|Animation Number 367
99|as long as
99|Animation Number 367
99|people worship you?
99|Animation Number 367
99|...or six months.
99|"Half a year,"
99|Animation Number 369
99|was where I felt a difference in her voice.
99|Animation Number 369
99|It shouldn't matter if your intent to kill is true.
99|If those are your true feelings, and not fleeting ones, you should be able to wait.
99|Six months? What happens in six months?
99|Graduation.
99|Graduation?
99|All right! Then I'll wait six months.
99|I see. Thank you very much.
99|Six months. Or more precisely, until graduation day...
99|After graduation, I'd like you to come straight to North Shirahebi Shrine. I'll be waiting there.
99|You should refrain from holding hands and such with Koyomi-oniichan until then.
99|Oh.
99|On the other end of the line,
99|Animation Number 381
99|I felt like Senjougahara was smiling.
99|Animation Number 381
99|If that isn't half-killing a snake...
99|It was no laughing matter.
99|Animation Number 383
99|If...
99|If we had met under different circumstances, maybe we'd have been able to become friends.
99|No, that would never happen.
99|Sorry, but I hate cute brats like you more than my former self, Sengoku Nadeko-san.
99|Ima mo zutto, sono koe wo oboeteru kara
99|I will always remember your voice, forever.
99|Ano hi hashitta michi ni ano hi miageta sora ni
99|I ran to you on this path. We admired the sky here.
99|Nidoto kaera nai toki wo kasaneteru
99|And here, we spent the time of our lives.
99|Kimi wa warau darou ka sukoshi okoru darou ne
99|Are you going to laugh, or are you going to be angy?
99|Konna akirame warui boku no koto wo
99|You'll probably be angry, but I just can't give up.
99|Nando demo
99|Time and time again,
99|Ukatsu ni negau kanousei wo seisa shite
99|I simply just want you.
99|itsumade mo
99|forever and ever
99|Mada amai uso ni damasarete takute
99|I want to be deceived by a lie.
99|Dakara douka, semete nante omou kokoro wa
99|My feeling are so chaotic,
99|Ichiji teki na kanshou datte yuruseba ii
99|so please forgive me.
99|Dakara sou sa, kimi ga yatto zetsubou no saki de
99|I want you to know that in the past,
99|Fureta hibi ni itsuwari nante nai to
99|the despair you found in me
99|Itte ageyou
99|was real.
99|Wasurenai de
99|Don't forget that.
99|Sengoku Nadeko has become a god.
99|That is all.
99|This is a story that could've ended with that one line.
99|That said, this story shouldn't be like the snakes I killed in the past. It wouldn't be polite to end it chopped.
99|So instead of an epilogue, I'll give an episode preview to wrap up.
99|Preview!
99|Preview.
99|Animation Number 405
99|Some day in March, six months later... Graduation day for the private Naoetsu High School.
99|I was on the grounds of North Shirahebi Shrine.
99|You can see my face clearly from the front.
99|This meant I had my eyes fixed on what was in front of me. I had no intention of hiding.
99|Because this day was the day for Sengoku Nadeko to say farewell to her human self.
99|Animation Number 418
99|The last day to see things with my own eyes.
99|Yes, yes, I at least want to have this strong of a resolve, while lying in wait...
99|...for them.
99|Araragi Koyomi.
99|Oshino Shinobu.
99|Senjougahara Hitagi.
99|And...
99|You can't call it a promise,
99|Animation Number 439
99|but behind those three
99|Animation Number 439
99|If Kanbaru-san or Hanekawa-san were there, that'd be perfect. That would be the entire cast!
99|As the last boss, it'd be the best thing that could happen for me.
99|Of course, even with all of them there, I feel there's no way I'd lose.
99|And if the final battle could begin with this signature phrase from me, I couldn't wish for anything more.
99|Red Scene
99|Animation Number 'none'
99|"Welcome, Koyomi-oniichan. I'll show you some love."
99|And the romantic comedy will start. The final showdown, in all sorts of ways!
99|Kaming soon. As expected from a kami.

99|I had a discussion with our brother about them some time ago.
99|Polishing shiny objects with only a brush can be quite the ordeal.
99|Sengoku Nadeko Quality Product: Albino Snake and it's included note
99|Note
99|Eh! How'd it turn out like this?
99|Even though I gave it my all!
99|What do you mean?
99|See, usually you'd be using a sponge or cloth to perform the finishing touch and get that shiny aspect.
99|What if this applied to tooth brushing too?
99|I see, I see. So what?
99|Sengoku's cooking! I'll eat it all!
99|Thank you, Koyomi-oniichan.
99|Onii-chan, you're so wonderful!
99|So I had him try that on me, thoroughly wiping each tooth one by one.
99|I have to say, my smile had never been so sparkling. Tooth wiping rocks!

100|Do you know which mathematical equation is the most beautiful?
100|e to the power of i times pi plus one equals zero.
100|This is also called Euler's identity.
100|This is the epitome of elegance, combining the basis of the natural logarithm,
100|the imaginary number i, the circumference ratio pi, and the integers one and zero.
100|One might argue that this equation
100|is the most powerful possible evidence that God exists, creating it to impose order on reality.
100|What's interesting— well, essentially, what's beautiful about it, is that this formula wasn't decided by us.
100|It's beautiful, but when you think about it, it's also frightening.
100|That said, Oshino Ougi,
100|the transfer student, would have dark things to say even about the beauty of Euler's identity.
100|Like so:
100|Yes, it is undeniably beautiful, Araragi.
100|I may just faint from its sheer beauty.
100|The most beautiful thing about it is that its solution is zero.
100|And it's my feeling that because the answer is zero, nobody needs to bother with it.
100|And that's what makes me think...
100|The only way to describe her is by saying that Ougi is just Ougi.
100|The world around her exists as a zero gradient.
100|She assimilates everything.
100|And so, this story is about mathematics.
100|Let us study.
100|If the idea of math fills you with apprehension, you might as well call it arithmetic instead.
100|Or, to make it even more simple, call it a story of numbers.
100|After all, as you'll soon see, the conclusion is driven by the largest number.
100|It's a story where the majority rules.
100|Majority rule.
100|The only way to turn even our mistakes into the truth.
100|It does not pursue individual happiness, but only cohesion constructed from consent.
100|Our expression of inequality.
100|An expression of our inequality.
100|In equality
100|We are un
100|This is the only thing truly invented by mankind.
100|And this is also the ugliest expression in human history.
100|Now, let us open the door
100|and start our adventure
100|Let us find the answer
100|leading to a true and just future
100|I want to do this, I want to do that
100|Enthralled by greed
100|I don't want this

100|I don't want that

100|I'm full of contradictions
100|When we are

100|are present
100|Now, let us open the door
100|and start our adventure

100|If there's anyone out there who's experienced
100|being locked in a mysterious classroom alone with a younger girl they'd just met for more than an hour,
100|I'd be really grateful for some advice right now.
100|I wouldn't get my hopes up, Araragi.
100|With the door, I mean, not with me.
100|I just meant that I already tried the windows and they didn't budge.
100|Nah.
100|Given the circumstances, I don't think I could have misunderstood.
100|The doors won't budge either.
100|But it doesn't feel locked.
100|More like glued shut.
100|Yes. Like I just said, the windows are shut tight.
100|They can be unlocked by flipping the lock here.
100|However, the main window frame still just won't move.
100|Yes, like it was glued shut.
100|All right.
100|Let's wait for help to arrive.
100|Thankfully Kanbaru knows that we're here.
100|About that...
100|So you're counting on being saved by others?
100|People can only save themselves.
100|Y'know?
100|I'm sorry.
100|That's my uncle's philosophy.
100|It doesn't have anything to do with the two of us.
100|However, relying on your friends isn't such a bad thing, Araragi.
100|I just don't think we should abandon our hopes of escaping on our own yet.
100|Because...
100|The hands of the clock did not advance by a single second since we entered the classroom.
100|Surely the battery is not dead.
100|This story begins exactly half a year after I was bitten by a blonde, golden-eyed vampire during the last third of October.
100|Naoetsu Private High
100|Hey, Araragi!
100|It's me, Kanbaru Suruga!
100|Are you alone?
100|You're alone!
100|You see, there is a girl I want to introduce to you!
100|Ain't she cute?!
100|So what's the deal with her?
100|This girl you want to introduce me to?
100|She said she wanted to talk to you and asked me to help her find you.
100|She wanted to talk to me?
100|I dunno either,
100|but apparently it's about oddities.
100|She seems to know a thing or two.
100|She knew about my left arm and your blood too.
100|She said her uncle told her.
100|Her uncle?
100|She transferred into 10th grade a little while back.
100|And guess what?
100|She's apparently Oshino's niece!
100|She says her name is Oshino Ougi.
100|It's strange, right?
100|Indeed.
100|It's mysterious, right?
100|Indeed.
100|It's suspicious.
100|Suspicious...

100|How, considering the number of students, a single building would have been more economical?
100|I was not.
100|Are you some kind of fool?
100|This is what I'm talking about.
100|What?
100|This.

100|The floor plan is odd.
100|Odd—or perhaps unnatural.
100|Here, look at the floors right below and above.
100|Do you see the rooms at the end of the hall?
100|Audiovisual Room
100|Isn't it strange that there's not a room on the floor between the two?
100|Huh...
100|But there is a room here on the third floor.
100|Audiovisual Room
100|It's the audiovisual room.
100|The plan is wrong there.
100|Or maybe not wrong, but...
100|It does show the auditorium in the correct place, but the real audiovisual room is not as long.
100|Audiovisual Room

100|You can see how, compared to the other room, it's about fifty percent longer, right?

100|Oh my, can it be that you don't trust me?
100|I am wounded.
100|Why would you do that?
100|You couldn't possibly be so attached to me that my distrust would wound you.
100|No, no, I am quite attracted...
100|To fools who are easily deceived.
100|If this were a mystery novel, then a sketch that does not conform to reality would indicate a hidden room.
100|But suppose
100|that oddities are involved in this.
100|We should investigate it before anyone suffers.
100|Well, what is this classroom doing here?
100|Why, when I came over here to do my sketch, it wasn't here.
100|How profoundly strange.
100|Let us investigate.
100|And here we are.
100|What do you think, Araragi?
100|Nothing much, to be honest.
100|But what sort of oddity would produce this, Ougi?
100|I don't know.
100|I'm not privy to my uncle's arcane knowledge.
100|I only know the major oddities that turn up in movies and comics.
100|Ougi
100|Koyomi
100|But there is one thing, Araragi,
100|that I can tell.
100|Oddities tend to have proportional reasons.
100|Which means, unraveling the reason why will lead us to our escape from here.
100|So, what reason would be behind us being locked in a classroom?
100|Even the clock has stopped.
100|Perhaps the time it displays provides a clue.
100|Are you not perturbed by this random time?
100|Six o'clock in the afternoon is when the students go home at this high school.
100|At a time when the students are about to go home, they are instead locked inside the classroom.
100|What could be the meaning of this?
100|They can't go home after school...
100|Perhaps it's a study session...
100|Study session...
100|Have you participated in a study session before, Araragi?
100|Y'see, I'm relatively smart, so I have no experience with them.
100|Not really...
100|What? Really?
100|Actually, I just tend to skip them if I'm asked to show up.
100|Lately, but especially during 10th grade.
100|During 10th grade?
100|What's wrong, Araragi?
100|This looks pretty bad.
100|I mean, you look pretty bad.
100|Really? Sorry...
100|I'm a bit dizzy...
100|You don't need to apologize.
100|Not at all.
100|Perhaps having to take care of your underclassman has finally fazed you.
100|Why don't you sit on a chair somewhere?
100|Why did you sit there?
100|What? Why do you ask?
100|Didn't you ask me to sit down?
100|No, I asked you why you sat down on that chair specifically.
100|I felt like it.
100|Was that chair the easiest to reach?
100|Did it look most inviting?
100|No...
100|I think they're all more or less the same.
100|Just...
100|Just?
100|I'm used to this one.
100|I guess.
100|Really?
100|What did you say, Ougi?
100|Oh, I'm just cycling through all the possibilities.
100|One of them being that you sat on that chair in the past and so chose it without hesitation.
100|Isn't that a little far-fetched?
100|I didn't even know there was a classroom here a little while ago.
100|This classroom wasn't here the first time I investigated the area.
100|It appeared when I came here with you.
100|So it's reasonable for me to assume that this is connected to you.
100|I suppose.
100|And didn't you say the view from the window was familiar?
100|I said that?
100|Yes, when we entered the room.
100|Before we realized we were locked up.
100|I don't remember saying that...
100|But I guess I must have, considering her confidence.
100|Yeah...
100|Now that I think about it...
100|It stimulates my memory...
100|Hello. What happened to you there, Araragi?
100|You look like you remembered something.
100|Did I say something that offended you?
100|Did you remember something you didn't want to?
100|No, I didn't.
100|I remembered nothing.
100|Yes, I remembered nothing—
100|Because I never forgot anything.
100|I could never forget any of it.
100|Class 1-3 Araragi Koyomi
100|My, my, didn't that textbook have your name on it?
100|How odd. How strange.
100|Why, I wonder.
100|Why is your textbook in this room?
100|Ougi...
100|Do you know something?
100|I know nothing.
100|You're the one who knows everything.
100|Ougi...
100|Do you see anything that shows today's date?
100|The date?
100|What date is it today? In this classroom, I mean.
100|It says that right there on the blackboard.
100|Look.
100|There.
100|July 15th.
100|Then how about this?
100|In this classroom, on July 15th, a Thursday, around six in the afternoon, something important happened.
100|I expect that it led to lingering unhappiness.
100|And perhaps, in turn, it manifested itself as an oddity.
100|The classroom was on the fifth floor of the building opposite the gym.
100|The room that my class, 1-3, held a class meeting in, on July 15th after school.
100|We ought to call it a trial.
100|We had a certain matter to talk about, and blamed each other for it.
100|And I, Araragi Koyomi of class 1-3, was at the center of the judicial maelstrom.
100|Yes.
100|That was when it began.
100|That was when I started believing it.
100|"I don't need friends."
100|"You become less human when you make friends."
100|You used to often say that, no?
100|I believe it was Hanekawa Tsubasa who rid you of it.
100|Well, we are all changed by the people we meet.
100|Let me ask out of curiosity.
100|How did this class change you?
100|How did class 1-3 change you?
100|Change me...
100|I'm told your personality changed significantly between middle and high school.
100|Could the reason be found in this classroom?
100|What happened, Araragi,
100|in this classroom, on that day, at that time?
100|Talk to me, Araragi.
100|Araragi Koyomi.
100|Talking about it will ease the pain.
100|No matter how harsh the memory, it is only a story when told.
100|A story...
100|Don't worry.
100|I'll listen to you faithfully.
100|Think what you will, but I am communicative.
100|We couldn't get out.
100|Excuse me?
100|We couldn't get out
100|until we had found the culprit.
100|No one was allowed out of the classroom.
100|The class meeting we ourselves held had that iron-clad rule.
100|Believe it or not, I was the moderator.
100|Two Years Ago
100|Naoetsu Private High School
100|Her name is Oikura Sodachi.
100|She wants to be called Euler, but most call her How Much.
100|Euler is, of course, based on phonetic similarity with Oikura,
100|but considering how calculating of a person she is,
100|I think it would have been unexpectedly fitting.
100|Oikura Sodachi
100|Class President Oikura.
100|It seems you called me here?
100|Get in.
100|The others are waiting.
100|The classroom held every student, without exception, of class 1-3.
100|Every single one?
100|You might say the whole cast was there.
100|So what looks like an empty classroom now had every seat filled back then.
100|I see. I see.
100|Time flies. It has been eons.
100|eons.
100|It has been eons.
100|Yeah. No, not eons. Only two years.
100|two years.
100|Anyway, to be specific, Oikura was at the front desk.
100|Standing on the front desk?
100|Oikura is not that eccentric.
100|Anyway, she stood at the front desk, and spoke thus:
100|"Let us begin with this extraordinary class meeting."
100|I have a question.
100|You didn't know there would be a class meeting until you entered the classroom, right?
100|That was a simple transmission error.
100|Over the course of the day, information about the meeting was circulated through the grapevine.
100|They passed around cell phone messages and folded paper.
100|But they merely passed me by.
100|Does that mean...
100|You were just as alone then as you are now?
100|You misunderstand.
100|She doesn't misunderstand entirely, though.
100|Araragi Koyomi = Loner
100|~
100|Ougi, this is the story of how someone without friends decided he needed no friends.
100|Then regain your composure and resume.
100|Tell me of your class meeting.
100|Now, what was on the agenda?
100|Oikura opened with the following.
100|The only item on today's agenda is finding the culprit.
100|Until the culprit is determined or names himself, nobody is allowed out.
100|Don't test me.
100|I looked over at Senjougahara Hitagi's seat.
100|She was seen as being of such frail constitution that she missed half of the first term.
100|That she was in attendance was a sign of the gravity of the situation.
100|The culprit...
100|That doesn't sound nice.
100|Just what could have happened?

100|Oikura was there too.
100|A study session, huh?
100|But once the marks were out, there was a difference of twenty points average

100|Oikura contended that such a large discrepancy meant foul play.
100|Someone obtained the exam questions from the staff room and brought up the test subjects in the study session.
100|Consequently, all those who participated got significantly higher marks.
100|If there is someone here
100|who smeared the merits of our study session and violated the secrecy of the exam questions,
100|they must be punished.
100|And those who didn't participate are not out of the woods.
100|This concerns the entirety of class 1-3.
100|Let me repeat.
100|Until the culprit is determined or names himself, nobody is allowed out.
100|Don't test me.
100|So I presume that Oikura relinquished the position to you after that.
100|You did say that you were the moderator of the class meeting.
100|Yes.
100|I chaired the meeting from there.
100|Chair Araragi Koyomi
100|Why did she pick you?

100|At the heart of all this was a math exam.
100|It was quite possible that the investigation would concern the exam questions and their content.
100|That means someone with exceptionally bad marks in math couldn't be the chair either.
100|I suppose it does.
100|But those who did not take part in the study session scored twenty points less on average.
100|Is there even someone among them who has marks on par with those from the study session?
100|There was.
100|There was someone who scored better than anybody in the study session.
100|And that was me.
100|What?
100|That is why I was chosen as chair.
100|Full marks.
100|Araragi Koyomi
100|One hundred points out of one hundred.
100|That was my math score in the term finals.
100|Now, please proceed without further ado, Araragi.
100|I believe I told you this, but the reason Oikura pathologically hates me is because I'm quite good at math.
100|She is convinced that the reason nobody will call her Euler is because I get better marks than she does.
100|All right.
100|Everyone who took part in the study session, please raise your hand.
100|Nineteen people took part in the study session going by the count of their hands.
100|So you narrowed down the suspects to one of those nineteen, huh?
100|How tremendously exciting.
100|Oh my, will I get detention now for being so tactless?
100|Let me spoil it now and tell you that the class meeting didn't uncover the culprit.
100|Huh?
100|It was a class meeting as stormy as any, and it ends with all of us none the wiser.
100|And—
100|I see!
100|Then I know what we need to do to leave this room, Araragi.
100|We'll be able to leave this room by solving the case that went unsolved two years ago.
100|Explain.
100|Oikura said she wouldn't let anybody out until the culprit was determined.
100|Conversely, that means that by finding out the culprit, one can leave the room.
100|Don't you agree?
100|This here is the shape assumed by the regret and guilt of all students in class 1-3.
100|Call it the ghost of your class meeting, if you want.
100|The ghost of our class meeting...
100|And because of something so inexplicable, I'm locked up in here?
100|Why me?
100|Perhaps because you're the one most haunted by it.
100|July 15th (Thu)
100|Your life was fundamentally changed on that day.
100|Fundamentally...
100|You avoided thinking about what happened that day.
100|You shirked it off.
100|There wasn't a day where you'd forgotten about it, but there also wasn't a day where you thought about it.
100|But now it has finally arrived—the day of reckoning.
100|The time to solve the mystery.
100|I hear your laughter beyond the door
100|You were supposed to be with me forever
100|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
100|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
100|I heard your voice from the hallway
100|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
100|At some point I became unable
100|to talk to you normally
100|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
100|You were supposed to be next to me forever
100|You knew how I felt
100|even when I said nothing
100|Now I know how important you were to me,
100|but we will never see each other again
101|Do you know which mathematical equation is the most beautiful?
101|e to the power of i times pi plus one equals zero.
101|This is also called Euler's identity.
101|This is the epitome of elegance, combining the basis of the natural logarithm,
101|the imaginary number i, the circumference ratio pi, and the integers one and zero.
101|One might argue that this equation
101|is the most powerful possible evidence that God exists, which he created to impose order on reality.
101|What's interesting— well, essentially, what's beautiful about it is that this formula wasn't decided by us.
101|It's beautiful, but when you think about it, it's also frightening.
101|That said, Oshino Ougi,
101|the transfer student, would have dark things to say even about the beauty of Euler's identity.
101|Like so:
101|Yes, it is undeniably beautiful, Araragi-senpai.
101|I may just faint from its sheer beauty.
101|The most beautiful thing about it is that its solution is zero.
101|And it's my feeling that because the answer is zero, nobody needs to bother with it.
101|And that's what makes me think...
101|The only way to describe her is by saying that Oshino Ougi is just Oshino Ougi.
101|The world around her exists as a zero gradient.
101|She assimilates everything.
101|Thus, this story is about mathematics.
101|Let us study.
101|If the idea of math fills you with apprehension, you might as well call it arithmetic instead.
101|Or, to make it even more simple, call it a story of numbers.
101|After all, as you'll soon see, the conclusion is driven by the largest number.
101|It's a story where the majority rules.
101|Majority rule.
101|The only way to turn even our mistakes into the truth.
101|It does not pursue individual happiness, but only cohesion constructed from consent.
101|Our expression of inequality.
101|An expression of our inequality.
101|In equality
101|We are un
101|This is the only thing truly invented by mankind.
101|And this is also the ugliest expression in human history.

101|If there's anyone out there who's experienced
101|being locked in a mysterious classroom alone with a younger girl they'd just met for more than an hour,
101|I'd be really grateful for some advice right now.
101|I wouldn't get my hopes up, Araragi-senpai.
101|Ah, I don't mean that I have a problem with you, Araragi-senpai.
101|I just meant that I already tried the windows and they didn't budge.
101|Nah.
101|Given the circumstances, I don't think I could have misunderstood.
101|The doors won't budge either.
101|But it doesn't feel locked.
101|More like glued shut.
101|Yes. Like I just said, the windows are shut tight.
101|They can be unlocked by flipping the lock here.
101|However, the main window frame just won't move.
101|Yes, like it was glued shut.
101|All right.
101|Let's wait for help to arrive, Ougi-chan.
101|Thankfully, Kanbaru knows that we're here.
101|About that...
101|So you're counting on being saved by others, Araragi-senpai?
101|People can only save themselves.
101|Y'know?
101|I'm sorry.
101|That's my uncle's philosophy.
101|It doesn't have anything to do with the two of us.
101|However, relying on your friends isn't such a bad thing, Araragi-senpai.
101|I just don't think we should abandon our hopes of escaping on our own yet.
101|Because...
101|The hands of the clock did not advance by a single second since we entered the classroom.
101|Surely the battery is not dead.
101|This story begins exactly half a year after I was bitten
101|Naoetsu Private High
101|by a blonde, golden-eyed vampire during the last third of October.
101|Hey, Araragi-senpai!
101|It's me, Kanbaru Suruga!
101|Are you alone?
101|You're alone!
101|You see, Araragi-senpai, there is a girl I want to introduce to you!
101|Isn't she cute?!
101|So what's the deal with her?
101|This girl you want to introduce me to?
101|She said she wanted to talk to you, Araragi-senpai, and asked me to help her find you.
101|She wanted to talk to me?
101|I don't know either,
101|but apparently it's about aberrations.
101|She seems to know a thing or two.
101|She knew about my left arm and your blood, too, Araragi-senpai.
101|She said her uncle told her.
101|Her uncle?
101|She transferred into 10th grade a little while back.
101|And guess what?
101|Apparently she's Oshino-san's niece!
101|She says her name is Oshino Ougi.
101|It's strange, right?
101|Indeed.
101|It's mysterious, right?
101|Indeed.
101|It's suspicious.
101|Suspicious...
101|Different.

101|How, considering the number of students, a single building would have been more economical?
101|I was not.

101|This is what I'm talking about.
101|What?

101|This.
101|The floor plan is odd.
101|Odd—or perhaps unnatural.
101|Here, look at the floors right below and above.
101|Do you see the rooms at the end of the hall?
101|Audiovisual Room
101|Isn't it strange that there isn't a room on the floor between the two?
101|Huh...
101|But there is a room here on the third floor.
101|Audiovisual Room
101|It's the audiovisual room.
101|The plan is wrong there.
101|Or maybe not wrong, but...
101|It does show the auditorium in the correct place, but the real audiovisual room is not as long.
101|Audiovisual Room
101|LL Classroom
101|You can see how, compared to the other room, it's about fifty percent longer, right?

101|Oh, my, can it be that you don't trust me, Araragi-senpai?
101|I am wounded.
101|Araragi-senpai, why would you do that?
101|You couldn't possibly be so attached to me that my distrust would wound you.
101|No, no, I am quite attracted...
101|To fools who are easily deceived.
101|If this were a mystery novel, then a sketch that does not conform to reality would indicate a hidden room.
101|But suppose
101|that aberrations are involved in this.
101|We should investigate it before anyone suffers.
101|Well, what is this classroom doing here?
101|Why, when I came over here to do my sketch, it wasn't here.
101|How profoundly strange.
101|Anyway, let's head inside.
101|And here we are.
101|What do you think, Araragi-senpai?
101|Nothing much, to be honest.
101|But, Ougi-chan, what sort of aberration would produce this?
101|I don't know.
101|I'm not privy to my uncle's arcane knowledge.
101|I only know of the major aberrations that turn up in movies and comics.
101|Ougi
101|Koyomi
101|But there is one thing, Araragi-senpai,
101|that I can tell.
101|Aberrations tend to have proportionate reasons.
101|Which means, unraveling the reason why will lead us to our escape from here.
101|So what reason would be behind us being locked in a classroom?
101|Even the clock has stopped.
101|Perhaps the time it displays provides a clue.
101|Are you not perturbed by this random time?
101|Six o'clock in the afternoon is when the students at this high school go home.
101|At a time when the students are about to go home, they are instead locked inside the classroom.
101|What could be the meaning of this?
101|They can't go home after school...
101|Perhaps it's a study session...
101|Study session...
101|Araragi-senpai, have you participated in a study session before?
101|You see, I'm relatively smart, so I have no experience with them.
101|Not really...
101|What? Really?
101|Actually, I just tend to skip them if I'm asked to show up.
101|I have lately, but even more so during the first year.
101|During the first year?
101|What's wrong, Araragi-senpai?
101|This looks pretty bad.
101|I mean, you look pretty bad.
101|Really? Sorry...
101|I'm a bit dizzy...
101|You don't need to apologize.
101|Not at all.
101|Perhaps having to take care of your underclassman has finally fazed you.
101|Why don't you sit on a chair somewhere?
101|Why did you sit there?
101|What? Why do you ask?
101|Ougi-chan, didn't you ask me to sit down?
101|No, I asked you why you sat down on that specific chair.
101|I felt like it.
101|Was that chair the easiest to reach?
101|Did it look most inviting?
101|No...
101|I think they're all more or less the same.
101|Just...
101|Just?
101|I'm used to this one.
101|I guess.
101|Really?
101|What did you say, Ougi-chan?
101|Oh, I'm just cycling through all of the possibilities.
101|One of them being that you sat on that chair in the past and so chose it without hesitation.
101|Isn't that a little far-fetched?
101|I didn't even know there was a classroom here a little while ago.
101|This classroom wasn't here the first time I investigated the area.
101|It appeared when I came here with you.
101|So, Araragi-senpai, it's reasonable for me to assume that this is connected to you.
101|I suppose.
101|And, Araragi-senpai, didn't you say the view from the window was familiar?
101|I said that?
101|Yes, when we entered the room.
101|Before we realized we were locked up.
101|I don't remember saying that...
101|But I guess I must have, considering her confidence.
101|Yeah...
101|Now that I think about it...
101|It stimulates my memory...
101|Hello. What happened to you there, Araragi-senpai?
101|You look like you remembered something.
101|Did I say something that offended you?
101|Did you remember something you didn't want to?
101|No, I didn't.
101|I remembered nothing.
101|Yes, I remembered nothing—
101|Because I never forgot anything.
101|I could never forget any of it.
101|Class 1-3 Araragi Koyomi
101|My, my, Araragi-senpai, didn't that textbook have your name on it?
101|How odd. How strange.
101|Why, I wonder.
101|Why is your textbook in this room?
101|Ougi-chan...
101|Do you know something?
101|I know nothing.
101|You're the one who knows everything.
101|Ougi-chan...
101|Do you see anything that shows today's date?
101|The date?
101|What date is it today? In this classroom, I mean.
101|It says that right there on the blackboard.
101|Please see for yourself.
101|There.
101|July 15th.
101|Then how about this?
101|In this classroom, on July 15th, a Thursday, around six in the afternoon, something important happened.
101|I expect that it led to lingering unhappiness.
101|And perhaps, in turn, it manifested itself as an aberration.
101|The classroom was on the fifth floor of the building opposite the gym.
101|The room that my class, 1-3, held a class meeting in after school on July 15th.
101|We ought to call it a trial.
101|We had a certain matter to talk about and blamed each other for it.
101|And I, Araragi Koyomi of class 1-3, was at the center of the judicial maelstrom.
101|Yes.
101|That was when it began.
101|That was when I started believing it.
101|"I don't need friends."
101|"You become less human when you make friends."
101|Araragi-senpai, you used to often say that, no?
101|I believe it was Hanekawa Tsubasa-san who rid you of it.
101|Well, we are all changed by the people we meet.
101|Let me ask out of curiosity.
101|How did this class change you, Araragi-senpai?
101|How did class 1-3 change you?
101|Change me...
101|I'm told your personality changed significantly between middle and high school.
101|Could the reason be found in this classroom?
101|What happened, Araragi-senpai,
101|in this classroom, on that day, at that time?
101|Talk to me, Araragi-senpai.
101|Araragi Koyomi.
101|Talking about it will ease the pain.
101|No matter how harsh the memory, it is only a story when told.
101|A story...
101|Don't worry.
101|I'll listen to you faithfully.
101|Think what you will, but I am communicative.
101|We couldn't get out.
101|Excuse me?
101|We couldn't get out
101|until we had found the culprit.
101|No one was allowed out of the classroom.
101|The class meeting we ourselves held had that ironclad rule.
101|Believe it or not, I was the moderator.
101|Two Years Ago
101|Naoetsu Private High School
101|Her name is Oikura Sodachi.
101|She wants to be called Euler, but most call her How Much.
101|Euler is, of course, based on phonetic similarity with Oikura,
101|but considering how calculating of a person she is,
101|I think it would have been unexpectedly fitting.
101|Oikura Sodachi
101|Class President Oikura.
101|It seems you called me here?
101|Get in.
101|The others are waiting.
101|The classroom held every student, without exception, of class 1-3.
101|Every single one?
101|You might say the whole cast was there.
101|So what looks like an empty classroom now had every seat filled back then.
101|I see. I see.
101|Time flies. It has been eons.
101|Yeah. No, not eons. Only two years.
101|eons.
101|It has been eons.
101|two years.
101|Anyway, to be specific, Oikura was at the front desk.
101|Standing on the front desk?
101|Oikura is not that eccentric.
101|Anyway, she stood at the front desk and spoke thus:
101|"Let us begin with this extraordinary class meeting."
101|I have a question.
101|You didn't know there would be a class meeting until you entered the classroom, right?
101|That was a simple transmission error.
101|Over the course of the day, information about the meeting was circulated through the grapevine.
101|They passed around cell phone messages and folded paper.
101|But they merely passed me by.
101|Does that mean...
101|You were just as alone then as you are now?
101|You misunderstand.
101|She doesn't misunderstand entirely, though.
101|Araragi Koyomi = Loner
101|~
101|Ougi-chan, this is the story of how someone without friends decided he needed no friends.
101|Then regain your composure and resume.
101|Tell me of your class meeting.
101|Now, what was on the agenda?
101|Oikura opened with the following:
101|The only item on today's agenda is finding the culprit.
101|Until the culprit is determined or names themselves, nobody is allowed to leave.
101|Don't test me.
101|I looked over at Senjougahara Hitagi's seat.
101|She was seen as someone of such frail constitution that she missed half of the first term.
101|That she was in attendance was a sign of the gravity of the situation.
101|The culprit...
101|That doesn't sound nice.
101|Just what could have happened?
101|Class 1-3 Curriculum Schedule
101|On the day before our term finals, after school,
101|there was a math study session here for anyone who was interested.

101|Study Session Details
101|Oikura was there, too.
101|A study session, huh?
101|But once the marks were out, there was an average difference of twenty points

101|Mathematics

101|Oikura contended that such a large discrepancy meant foul play.
101|Someone obtained the exam questions from the staff room
101|and brought up the test subjects in the study session.
101|Consequently, all of those who participated got significantly higher marks.
101|If there is someone here
101|who smeared the merits of our study session and violated the secrecy of the exam questions,
101|they must be punished.
101|And those who didn't participate are not out of the woods.
101|This concerns the entirety of class 1-3.
101|Let me repeat.
101|Until the culprit is determined or names themselves, nobody is allowed to leave.
101|Don't test me.
101|So I presume that Oikura-senpai relinquished the position to you after that, Araragi-senpai.
101|You did say that you were the moderator of the class meeting, Araragi-senpai.
101|Yes.
101|I chaired the meeting from there.
101|Chair Araragi Koyomi
101|Araragi-senpai, why did she pick you?

101|At the heart of all this was a math exam.
101|It was quite possible that the investigation would concern the exam questions and their content.
101|That means someone with exceptionally bad marks in math couldn't be the chair, either.
101|I suppose it does.
101|But those who did not take part in the study session scored twenty points less on average.
101|Is there even someone among them who has marks on par with those from the study session?
101|There was.
101|There was someone who scored better than anybody in the study session.
101|And that was me.
101|What?
101|That is why I was chosen as chair.
101|Full marks.
101|Araragi Koyomi
101|One hundred points out of one hundred.
101|That was my math score in the term finals.
101|Now, please proceed without further ado, Araragi.
101|I believe I told you this, but Oikura pathologically hates me because I'm quite good at math.
101|She is convinced that nobody will call her Euler because I get better marks than she does.
101|All right.
101|Everyone who took part in the study session, please raise your hand.
101|Going by the count of their hands, nineteen people took part in the study session.
101|So you narrowed down the suspects to one of those nineteen, huh?
101|How tremendously exciting.
101|Oh, my. Will I get detention now for being so tactless?
101|Let me spoil it now, Ougi-chan, and tell you that the class meeting didn't uncover the culprit.
101|Huh?
101|It was a class meeting as stormy as any and it ends with all of us none the wiser.
101|And—
101|I see!
101|Then I know what we need to do to leave this room, Araragi-senpai.
101|We'll be able to leave this room by solving the case that went unsolved two years ago.
101|Explain.
101|Oikura-senpai said she wouldn't let anybody out until the culprit was determined.
101|Conversely, that means that by finding who the culprit is, one can leave the room.
101|Don't you agree?
101|This here is the shape assumed by the regret and guilt of all of the students in class 1-3.
101|Call it the ghost of your class meeting, if you want.
101|The ghost of our class meeting...
101|And because of something so inexplicable I'm locked up in here?
101|Why me?
101|Perhaps because you're the one most haunted by it, Araragi-senpai.
101|July 15th (Thu)
101|Araragi-senpai, your life was fundamentally changed on that day.
101|Fundamentally...
101|You avoided thinking about what happened that day.
101|You shirked it off.
101|There wasn't a day when you'd forgotten about it, but there also wasn't a day when you thought about it.
101|But now it has finally arrived—the day of reckoning.
101|The time to solve the mystery.

101|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara

102|Mebe Miawa 95 Hayamachi Seiko 92 Senjougahara Hitagi 98 Kouma Okitada 97 Araragi Koyomi 100
102|And so, that means you wound up on the list of suspects too, Araragi.
102|Yes, I did.
102|And then?
102|Marizumi said that there was no proof such a study session existed to begin with.
102|Marizumi Hyoui
102|That's getting pretty fundamental.
102|Study Session Details
102|However, it was soon testified that the claimed study session existed.
102|Sunahama arrived early to school on the day of the exam because she was on day duty,
102|Sunahama Ruise
102|and was stuck with having to clean up after the study session from the day before.
102|Clean up?
102|The desks weren't lined up, there was stuff on the board, and she had to take out a trash can full of candy wrappers.
102|Tetsujou helped her because she arrived early too.
102|Tetsujou Komichi
102|What else did they argue about?
102|Higuma said that someone must have spread example questions in the study session like those on the test.
102|Higuma Sekirou
102|He said the culprit could be found by following that train of thought.
102|I see. That's a good idea.
102|Oikura couldn't forgive that.
102|And so Oikura...
102|She was persistent about continuing this "figuring out the culprit" ordeal.
102|Then let's take a look at the exam problems in greater detail.
102|Let's establish just how much the exam and study session problems overlapped
102|based on the testimony of those present.
102|And then, we will determine the culprit.
102|I won't allow anyone out of the classroom until then.
102|That sounds like endless, ugly arguments, and fruitless exchanges.
102|I can see you embracing a deep hatred for the human animal amid that chaos.
102|You're wrong.
102|Oh, my.
102|Ougi, what drove me to desperation was not the argument.
102|It was the conclusion.
102|We felt like we were on
102|the right track.
102|Nobody expected it would end the way it did.
102|We went astray during the final stretches of our pursuit of justice.
102|I lost sight of my moral compass in that instant.
102|The conclusion? But you said you didn't find the culprit.
102|I suppose it's a little anticlimactic as far as outcomes go,
102|but enough for despair?
102|We didn't find the culprit.
102|But that doesn't mean we didn't determine who it was.
102|Huh?
102|That's the reason for my despair.
102|Coming to a decision beyond one's knowledge.
102|That's what drove me to despair.
102|I see, I see, I see.
102|Then, Araragi,
102|would you please tell me the rest?
102|The bell was about to ring.
102|Surely the patience of those inside the classroom was being tested after two hours of discussion.
102|What conclusion did you reach when patience ran out?
102|What did it come to?
102|How extremely fascinating.
102|I am so curious.
102|How I wish everyone would have lived happily after overcoming all that endless, unruly garbage.
102|Now, let us open the door
102|and start our adventure
102|Let us find the answer
102|leading to a true and just future
102|I want to do this, I want to do that
102|Enthralled by greed
102|I don't want this
102|,
102|I don't want that
102|,
102|I'm full of contradictions
102|When we are
102|all present
102|When all our lies
102|are present
102|Now, let us open the door
102|and start our adventure
102|Let us find the answer
102|leading to a true and just future
102|Remember our boundless regret
102|with eyes averted
102|Hear the mistakes we amassed
102|with ears held
102|Pray we don't do it again
102|This pisses me off.
102|Just make me the culprit and we can all go.
102|Saying that shit isn't gonna help.
102|You covering for someone?
102|You know the culprit?
102|Is there even a culprit to begin with?
102|That's the basis for this whole argument! Don't start again with that shit.
102|Is there even someone here capable of stealing from the staff room?
102|Taking the ethics out of the equation, who could physically do that?
102|No, I'm actually talking about who has the balls to do it.
102|Are you retarded?
102|How's that gonna help us?
102|You're all lying!
102|I can't stand this.
102|Don't the computers have the exam questions these days?
102|I'm sorry, but would you please raise your hand before you speak?
102|You don't have to break into the staff room. You can hack their computer.
102|I said this before, but I think Oikura explained the last question to us. Not that I remember perfectly.
102|Then don't say it.
102|You realize that's libel, right?
102|You've always been like this.
102|Please raise your hand.
102|Man, I want to go!
102|Just go on without me.
102|You can't go home.
102|They might make you the culprit if you leave.
102|I don't care.
102|Please calm down, everyone.
102|Collect yourselves.
102|I can't calm down!
102|If you want to speak, ra—
102|Look, Araragi got full marks.
102|The test clearly couldn't have been that hard.
102|All that stuff about cheating and crimes is nonsense.
102|Hey, Senjougahara, what do you think?
102|I don't know.
102|Do your duty, Araragi.
102|That's easy for you to say.
102|Why was there only a study session for math, anyway?
102|There was a history study session too.
102|Why didn't you invite me?
102|If you were the homeroom teacher and taught math and your students had bad grades,
102|you'd be in a bad position, right?
102|It's for staff room cred.
102|Earns you brownie points with the principal.
102|That's not the reason.
102|Math is the most beautiful of all academic pursuits.
102|You're the only one who thinks that.
102|What the hell is the beauty in that?
102|That's just what you tell yourself.
102|You don't understand the beauty of mathematics?
102|Please stop fighting.
102|We aren't fighting, man!
102|Alibi, my ass! You don't even know when the crime was!
102|This can't continue.
102|I can't control it.
102|Stop it, Oikura.
102|This is too much.
102|Stop this before things get worse.
102|You whine like a dog.
102|Giving up even though you had a higher score?
102|Yup, sure, I give up.
102|I can't do it.
102|Nobody goes home until the culprit is determined.
102|We can't do that.
102|They'll all go home when the bell rings.
102|You know that!
102|I forgot how fiery her hatred for me is.
102|I hate you.
102|You really need to do something to fix that part of you.
102|What?! Coming from you?!
102|Listen up!
102|I believe that we've had quite enough discussion.
102|We will now come to a decision.
102|We'll take a vote on who the culprit is.
102|Oh, I see.
102|Then I trust a large section of the class colluded to turn you into the culprit, Araragi.
102|No.
102|Oikura was the only one who voted for me.
102|What?
102|Suspect number six collected the most votes,
102|that being Oikura Sodachi.
102|I cannot forget that look of sheer disgust.
102|I believe I was swept up by it.
102|She never came back to school, neither to exams nor to class.
102|I think she is still covered for in the attendance record of a senior class somewhere here.
102|But I don't know which one.
102|Ever since then, I skipped school even more than before.
102|I felt an unspecific but lasting guilt going to a school that Oikura did not attend.
102|And I also never again scored full marks in mathematics.
102|I believe you shoulder too much.
102|Didn't someone say that Oikura was the prime suspect?
102|Nobody told her to plan that meeting.
102|It was her own decision.
102|She would have no reason to do that as the culprit.
102|I can assert on that alone that it wasn't her.
102|I see.
102|Assert, huh?
102|Anyway.
102|I saw what was right being fabricated out of thin air, witnessed an utterly absurd conclusion,
102|and lost a piece of me there.
102|A bit of my sanity, perhaps.
102|The majority of students raised their hand without conspiring to,
102|without communicating with each other.
102|I saw truth being decided.
102|I saw justice being decided.
102|I have never been so shocked.
102|I lost sight of the truth there.
102|No.
102|I lost it entirely.
102|Up until that point, I believed something like truth or justice existed.
102|Before then, I understood that you couldn't always do what's right and just,
102|but...
102|If many people
102|acknowledge
102|something,
102|even if it's false,
102|cruel, or stupid,
102|true and just.
102|I realized that it can just become
102|I came to realize that truth can be mass-produced like toy cars.
102|The right number of people establishes what is true and just.
102|The majority can manufacture justice.
102|And so I chose isolation over desolation.
102|"I don't need friends."
102|"You become less human when you make friends."
102|That was my only choice to protect my own personal truth and justice.
102|Well, that took a long time.
102|That was the story of Araragi Koyomi.
102|Thank you for listening, Ougi.
102|You were right.
102|It wasn't a big deal in the end.
102|I feel better now.
102|That's a problem.
102|We're not ready to have you feel better just yet, Araragi.
102|If this story ends with Oikura not being the culprit, then we'll be stuck in this room.
102|We must determine the culprit to escape.
102|We must do what you couldn't that day, without resorting to majority rule,
102|but alone as individuals.
102|You said Oikura's grudge produced this classroom, right?
102|Then there's a certain logic to me being trapped here.
102|Oikura perhaps
102|still hasn't forgiven me?
102|Just like that day
102|Does she still hate me?
102|No, I believe she has forgotten you, to be honest.
102|So how do you explain this room?
102|Didn't I tell you?
102|Your own heart gave rise to this classroom.
102|That's how I'm defining it.
102|Regret gave rise to this room.
102|If you had found the correct culprit back then, Oikura Sodachi's life would not have imploded.
102|You would not have lost justice.
102|You regret that and created this room.
102|You've been in search of the truth and justice you lost ever since then.
102|You created this classroom to find it again.
102|I...
102|Is that possible?
102|Could I have made this room?
102|But oddities have proportional reasons.
102|If so, my own self is reason enough for this.
102|You want to redo the class meeting?
102|And, together, find the culprit? The real one?
102|Oh, no, we already know the real one.
102|You know the real culprit too.
102|You know who the real prime suspect should have been.
102|It was quite obvious from listening to you.
102|The reason your empathy for Oikura's situation is stronger than it has to be
102|is because subconsciously you know the real culprit.
102|You would not have told the story this way otherwise.
102|This way?
102|What is she talking about?
102|What does she know?
102|I know nothing.
102|You know everything.
102|Araragi Koyomi.
102|I...
102|Gather the suspects, says Sherlock Holmes.
102|Let me stand in for Mr. Holmes here.
102|Now, let us mourn the sorry fool Oikura Sodachi, who was struck down by her own deeds,
102|and solemnly find the culprit she was seeking.
102|Since we are about to, I must add this.
102|Exorcising oddities is similar to solving mysteries— the procedure is important.
102|Reader, you now have all the clues.
102|The culprit is Tetsujou Komichi.
102|Ought I say more?
102|Please.
102|Why do you think it was her?
102|When I asked you whether all seats were filled when you entered the classroom,
102|you specified that Oikura's was empty.
102|But that means someone was sitting in your chair.
102|Someone must have been sitting there.
102|Like your homeroom teacher.
102|But that's not enough to prove that she's the culprit.
102|As the meeting degenerated, someone said it, right?
102|The homeroom teacher of class 1-3 is also their math teacher.
102|She wouldn't need to have knowledge of the questions.
102|She writes them.
102|She can adjust the questions to match the study session.
102|Sunahama was on day duty the next day
102|and complained about having to clean up after everyone from the study session.
102|You said Tetsujou Komichi helped her.
102|What did she help her with?
102|Hey, Araragi, what was it again?
102|Throwing out the trash? Rearranging desks?
102|Not that!
102|Wiping the blackboard.
102|Of course, a lot is written on the blackboard and erased again.
102|It wasn't possible to deduce all the contents of the study session that way.
102|So she gleaned a part of the study session.
102|Yes.
102|And since she's the teacher, she can adjust the exam problems to match the contents of the study session.
102|(Wed)
102|(Thu)
102|(Wed)
102|(Thu)
102|She had a couple of hours.
102|It was probably only enough to change some of them.
102|Now, uh... The motive?
102|The motivation for the crime? Why did she do it?
102|You know that too, Ougi?
102|This is a pointless crime if a student were to blame.
102|If the entire class got good grades, their personal deviation from the average would decline.
102|However, there is one person whose standing improves if the entire class receives good grades.

102|And that person is the math teacher.
102|Their ability to teach would be rewarded.
102|Did I miss something?
102|No.
102|I see.
102|Then let's go home.
102|You can leave, Araragi.
102|I can leave?
102|Huh?
102|I thought it was a strange line.
102|What do you mean?
102|Oh, perhaps you don't know this.
102|Vampires need permission to enter rooms and buildings.
102|Right...
102|Can't say I've ever had to get it.
102|Well, Shinobu is pretty special.
102|Anyway, this was about not being able to leave instead of enter, so I wanted to reference it.
102|Just to put you at ease.
102|That made it sound like you imprisoned me here, Ougi.
102|Now that's not fair.
102|I would never imprison you.
102|Why would I do that?
102|You've been a prisoner of your past for two whole years.
102|Right?
102|Let me speculate.
102|I believe it is only natural that you felt betrayed when your teacher, a moral figurehead, cheated.
102|She then atoned by using her influence to keep Oikura from failing grades due to no attendance.
102|Atoned?
102|No. That's all self-serving.
102|She wants to believe she's a great human being.
102|What threw me into despair...
102|Now the next one.
102|Number six.
102|All who believe that I, Oikura Sodachi, am the culprit, please raise your hand.
102|What threw me into despair was that our teacher, Tetsujou Komichi, sitting among my classmates,
102|raised her hand without hesitation.
102|The next day I went to the audiovisual room on a whim before going to my own classroom.
102|Or, well, to the space adjacent it.
102|Needless to say, there was no abandoned classroom there.
102|There was no dead space like in Ougi's notebook either.
102|There was just nothing there.
102|Not then, not now.
102|No hidden room, no secret, no investigation.
102|No disturbing truth.
102|No class meeting.
102|No majority vote.
102|It was all in the past and done with.
102|Tetsujou Komichi isn't in the staff room anymore.
102|That's not to say that she quit out of guilt or was sacked.
102|She became pregnant and went on maternity leave.
102|Congratulations.
102|She is unlikely to return before I graduate.
102|I don't believe I'll ever see her again.
102|I feel nothing about that.
102|Besides, when I saw her raise her hand two years ago,
102|she stopped being a teacher or an adult to me.
102|Good morning, Araragi.
102|Oh, good morning, Hanekawa.
102|Bad timing.
102|What?
102|You shouldn't come into the classroom right now.
102|All right.
102|Araragi, you know how there's an empty seat in our class, right?
102|Yeah...
102|It's a spare, right?
102|What?
102|Is a ghost sitting there right now or what?
102|Just so you know, ghosts aren't enough to scare me anymore.
102|It wasn't a ghost was sitting there.
102|It was a person.
102|A classmate came back to school who hasn't been here in a long time.
102|Really now...?
102|So that desk—
102|It's theirs, right?
102|I didn't know we had another classmate.
102|So why shouldn't I come in?
102|Because it's Oikura.
102|Oikura Sodachi.
102|She spent those two years studying alone at home.
102|It's almost like she switched places with Miss Tetsujou.
102|You don't get along with her, right?
102|I hear your laughter beyond the door
102|You were supposed to be with me forever
102|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
102|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
102|I heard your voice from the hallway
102|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
102|At some point I became unable
102|to talk to you normally
102|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
102|You were supposed to be next to me forever
102|You knew how I felt
102|even when I said nothing
102|Now I know how important you were to me,
102|but we will never see each other again

103|Mebe Miawa 95 Hayamachi Seiko 92 Senjougahara Hitagi 98 Kouma Okitada 97 Araragi Koyomi 100
103|Thus, that means you wound up on the list of suspects as well, Araragi-senpai.
103|Yes, I did.
103|And then?
103|Marizumi said that there was no proof such a study session existed to begin with.
103|Marizumi Hyoui
103|That's getting pretty fundamental.
103|Study Session Details
103|However, it was soon testified that the claimed study session existed.
103|Sunahama arrived early to school on the day of the exam because she was on day duty
103|Sunahama Ruise
103|and was stuck with having to clean up after the study session from the day before.
103|Clean up?
103|The desks weren't lined up, there was stuff on the board,
103|and she had to take out a trash can full of candy wrappers.
103|Tetsujou helped her because she arrived early too.
103|Tetsujou Komichi
103|What else did they argue about?
103|Higuma said that someone must have spread example questions in the study session like those on the test.
103|Higuma Sekirou
103|He said the culprit could be found by following that train of thought.
103|I see. That's a good idea.
103|Thus, Oikura...
103|Oikura couldn't forgive that.
103|She was persistent about continuing this "figuring out who the culprit is" ordeal.
103|Then let's take a look at the exam problems in greater detail.
103|Let's establish just how much the exam and study session problems overlapped
103|based on the testimony of those present.
103|And then we will determine the culprit.
103|I won't allow anyone out of the classroom until then.
103|That sounds like endless, ugly arguments and fruitless exchanges.
103|I can see you embracing a deep hatred for the human animal amid that chaos, Araragi-senpai.
103|You're wrong.
103|Oh, my.
103|Ougi-chan, what drove me to desperation was not the argument.
103|It was the conclusion.
103|We felt like we were on
103|the right track.
103|Nobody expected it would end the way it did.
103|We went astray during the final stretches of our pursuit of justice.
103|I lost sight of my moral compass in that instant.
103|The conclusion? But you said you didn't find the culprit.
103|I suppose it's a little anticlimactic as far as outcomes go,
103|but enough for despair?
103|We didn't find the culprit.
103|But that doesn't mean we didn't determine who it was.
103|Huh?
103|That's the reason for my despair.
103|Coming to a decision beyond one's knowledge.
103|That's what drove me to despair.
103|I see, I see, I see.
103|Then, Araragi-senpai,
103|would you please tell me the rest?
103|The bell was about to ring.
103|Surely the patience of those inside the classroom was being tested after two hours of discussion.
103|What conclusion did you reach when patience ran out?
103|What did it come to?
103|How extremely fascinating.
103|I am so curious.
103|How I wish everyone would have lived happily after overcoming all that endless, unruly garbage.

103|Saying that isn't gonna help.
103|Are you covering for someone?
103|You know the culprit?
103|Is there even a culprit to begin with?
103|That's the basis for this whole argument! Don't start again with that.
103|Is there even someone here capable of stealing from the staff room?
103|Taking the ethics out of the equation, who could physically do that?
103|No, I'm actually talking about who is brave enough to do that.
103|Are you an idiot?
103|How's that gonna help us?
103|You're all lying!
103|I can't stand this.
103|Don't the computers have the exam questions these days?
103|I'm sorry, but would you please raise your hand before you speak?
103|You don't have to break into the staff room. You can hack their computer.
103|I said this before, but I think Oikura explained the last question to us. Not that I remember perfectly.
103|Then don't say it.
103|You realize that's libel, right?
103|You've always been like this.
103|Please raise your hand.
103|Come on, I want to go!
103|Just go on without me.
103|You can't go home.
103|They might make you the culprit if you leave.
103|I don't care.
103|Please calm down, everyone.
103|Collect yourselves.
103|I can't calm down!
103|If you want to speak, ra—
103|Look, Araragi got full marks.
103|The test clearly couldn't have been that hard.
103|All that stuff about cheating and crimes is nonsense.
103|Hey, Senjougahara-sama, what do you think?
103|I don't know.
103|Araragi, do your duty.
103|That's easy for you to say.
103|Why was there only a study session for math, anyway?
103|There was a history study session, too.
103|Why didn't you invite me?
103|If you were the homeroom teacher and taught math and your students had bad grades,
103|you'd be in a bad position, right?
103|It's for respect in the staff room.
103|Makes the principle think you're doing a better job.
103|That's not the reason.
103|Math is the most beautiful of all academic pursuits.
103|You're the only one who thinks that.
103|What is the beauty in that?
103|That's just what you tell yourself.
103|You don't understand the beauty of mathematics?
103|Please stop fighting.
103|We aren't fighting!
103|Don't talk to me about alibis! You don't even know when the crime took place!
103|This can't continue.
103|I can't control it.
103|Stop it, Oikura.
103|This is too much.
103|Stop this before things get worse.
103|Why are you whining so much?
103|Giving up even though you had a higher score?
103|Yeah, sure, I give up.
103|I can't do it.
103|Nobody goes home until the culprit is determined.
103|We can't do that.
103|They'll all go home when the bell rings.
103|You know that!
103|I forgot how fiery her hatred for me is.
103|I hate you.
103|You really need to do something to fix that part of you.
103|What?! Coming from you?!
103|Everyone!
103|I believe that we've had quite enough discussion.
103|We will now come to a decision.
103|We'll take a vote on who the culprit is.
103|Oh, I see.
103|Then I trust a large section of the class colluded to turn you, Araragi-senpai, into the culprit.
103|No.
103|Oikura was the only one who voted for me.
103|What?
103|Suspect number six collected the most votes,
103|that being Oikura Sodachi.
103|I cannot forget that look of sheer disgust.
103|I believe I was swept up by it.
103|She never came back to school. Neither to exams nor to class.
103|I think she is still covered for in the attendance record of a senior class somewhere here.
103|But I don't know which one.
103|Ever since then, I skipped school even more than before.
103|I felt an unspecific but lasting guilt for going to a school that Oikura did not attend.
103|And I also never again scored full marks in mathematics.
103|I believe you shoulder too much.
103|Didn't someone say that Oikura-senpai was the prime suspect?
103|Nobody told her to plan that meeting.
103|It was her own decision.
103|She would have no reason to do that as the culprit.
103|I can assert on that alone that it wasn't Oikura.
103|I see.
103|Assert, huh?
103|Anyway.
103|I saw what was right being fabricated out of thin air, witnessed an utterly absurd conclusion,
103|and lost a piece of me there.
103|A bit of my sanity, perhaps.
103|The majority of students raised their hand without conspiring to,
103|without communicating with each other.
103|I saw truth being decided.
103|I saw justice being decided.
103|I had never been so shocked.
103|I lost sight of the truth there.
103|No.
103|I lost it entirely.
103|Up until that point, I believed something like truth or justice existed.
103|Before then, I understood that you couldn't always do what's right and just,
103|but...
103|If many people
103|acknowledge
103|something,
103|even if it's false,
103|cruel, or stupid,
103|true and just.
103|I realized that it can simply become
103|I came to realize that truth can be mass-produced like toy cars.
103|The right number of people establishes what is true and just.
103|The majority can manufacture justice.
103|And so I chose isolation over desolation.
103|"I don't need friends."
103|"You become less human when you make friends."
103|That was my only choice to protect my own personal truth and justice.
103|Well, that took a long time.
103|That was the story of Araragi Koyomi.
103|Thank you for listening, Ougi-chan.
103|You were right.
103|It wasn't a big deal in the end.
103|I feel better now.
103|That's a problem.
103|We're not ready to have you feel better just yet, Araragi-senpai.
103|If this story ends with Oikura-senpai not being the culprit, then we'll be stuck in this room.
103|We must determine who the culprit is to escape.
103|We must do what you couldn't that day, without resorting to majority rule,
103|but alone as individuals.
103|You said Oikura's grudge produced this classroom, right?
103|Then there's a certain logic to me being trapped here.
103|Perhaps Oikura
103|still hasn't forgiven me?
103|Just like that day
103|Does she still hate me?
103|No, I believe she has forgotten you, to be honest.
103|So how do you explain this room?
103|Didn't I tell you?
103|Araragi-senpai, your own heart gave rise to this classroom.
103|That's how I define it.
103|Regret gave rise to this room.
103|If you had found the correct culprit back then, Oikura Sodachi's life would not have imploded.
103|You would not have lost justice.
103|You regret that and created this room.
103|You've been in search of the truth and justice you lost ever since then.
103|You created this classroom to find it again.
103|I...
103|Is that possible?
103|Could I have made this room?
103|But aberrations have proportionate reasons.
103|If so, my own self is reason enough for this.
103|You want to redo the class meeting?
103|And together find the culprit? The real one?
103|Oh, no, we already know the real one.
103|Araragi-senpai, you know the real culprit, too.
103|You know who the real prime suspect should have been.
103|Araragi-senpai, it was quite obvious from listening to you.
103|Araragi-senpai, the reason your empathy for Oikura-senpai's situation is stronger than it has to be
103|is because you subconsciously know the real culprit.
103|You would not have told the story this way otherwise.
103|This way?
103|What is she talking about?
103|What does she know?
103|I know nothing.
103|You know everything, Araragi-senpai.
103|Araragi Koyomi.
103|I...
103|Gather the suspects, says the Great Detective.
103|Let me stand in for the Great Detective here.
103|Now, let us mourn the sorry fool Oikura Sodachi, who was struck down by her own deeds,
103|and solemnly find the culprit she was seeking.
103|Since we are about to, I must add this.
103|Exorcising aberrations is similar to solving mysteries— the procedure is important.
103|Reader, you now have all the clues.
103|The culprit is Tetsujou Komichi.
103|Ought I say more?
103|Please.
103|Why do you think it was Tetsujou?
103|Araragi-senpai, when I asked you whether all of the seats were filled when you entered the classroom,
103|you specified that Oikura-senpai's was empty.
103|But that means someone was sitting in your chair, Araragi-senpai.
103|Someone must have been sitting there.
103|Like your homeroom teacher.
103|But that's not enough to prove that she's the culprit.
103|As the meeting degenerated, someone said it, right?
103|The homeroom teacher of class 1-3 is also their math teacher.
103|She wouldn't need to have knowledge of the questions.
103|She writes them.
103|She can adjust the questions to match the study session.
103|Sunahama-senpai was on day duty the next day
103|and complained about having to clean up after everyone from the study session.
103|You said Tetsujou Komichi helped her.
103|What did she help her with?
103|Hey, Araragi-senpai, what was it again?
103|Throwing out the trash? Rearranging desks?
103|Not that!
103|Wiping the blackboard.
103|Of course, a lot is written on the blackboard and erased again.
103|It wasn't possible to deduce all the contents of the study session that way.
103|So she gleaned a part of the study session.
103|Yes.
103|And because she's the teacher, she can adjust the exam problems to match the contents of the study session.
103|(Wed)
103|(Thu)
103|(Wed)
103|(Thu)
103|She had a couple of hours.
103|It was probably only enough to change some of them.
103|Now, uh... the motive?
103|The motivation for the crime? Why did she do it?
103|Ougi-chan, you know that as well?
103|This is a pointless crime if a student were to blame.
103|If the entire class got good grades, their personal deviation from the average would decline.
103|However, there is one person whose standing improves if the entire class receives good grades.

103|And that person is the math teacher.
103|Her ability to teach would be rewarded.
103|Did I miss something, Araragi-senpai?
103|No.
103|I see.
103|Then let's go home.
103|You can leave, Araragi-senpai.
103|I can leave?
103|Huh?
103|I thought it was a strange line.
103|What do you mean?
103|Oh, perhaps you don't know this.
103|Vampires need permission to enter rooms and buildings.
103|Right...
103|Can't say I've ever had to get it.
103|Well, Shinobu-san is pretty special.
103|Anyway, this was about not being able to leave instead of enter, so I wanted to reference it.
103|Just to put you at ease.
103|That made it sound like you imprisoned me here, Ougi-chan.
103|Now that's not fair.
103|I would never imprison you, Araragi-senpai.
103|Why would I do that?
103|Araragi-senpai, you've been a prisoner of your past for two whole years.
103|Right?
103|Let me speculate.
103|I believe it is only natural that you felt betrayed, Araragi-senpai,
103|when your teacher, a moral figurehead, cheated.
103|Tetsujou-sensei then atoned by using her influence
103|to keep Oikura from failing classes due to a lack of attendance.
103|Atoned?
103|No. That's all self-serving.
103|She wants to believe she's a great human being.
103|What threw me into despair...
103|Now for the next one.
103|Number six.
103|All who believe that I, Oikura Sodachi, am the culprit, please raise your hand.
103|What threw me into despair was that our teacher, Tetsujou Komichi, sitting among my classmates,
103|raised her hand without hesitation.
103|The next day, I went to the audiovisual room on a whim before going to my own classroom.
103|Or, well, to the space adjacent it.
103|Needless to say, there was no abandoned classroom there.
103|There was no dead space like there was in Ougi-chan's notebook, either.
103|There was just nothing there.
103|Not then, not now.
103|No hidden room, no secret, no investigation.
103|No disturbing truth.
103|No class meeting.
103|No majority vote.
103|It was all in the past and done with.
103|Tetsujou Komichi isn't in the staff room anymore.
103|That's not to say that she quit out of guilt or was fired.
103|She became pregnant and went on maternity leave.
103|Congratulations.
103|She is unlikely to return before I graduate.
103|I don't believe I'll ever see Tetsujou again.
103|I feel nothing about that.
103|Besides, when I saw her raise her hand two years ago,
103|she stopped being a teacher or an adult to me.
103|Good morning, Araragi-kun.
103|Oh, good morning, Hanekawa.
103|Bad timing.
103|What?
103|Araragi-kun, you shouldn't come into the classroom right now.
103|All right.
103|Araragi-kun, you know how there's an empty seat in our class, right?
103|Yeah...
103|It's a spare, right?
103|What?
103|Is a ghost sitting there right now or what?
103|Just so you know, ghosts aren't enough to scare me anymore.
103|It wasn't a ghost sitting there.
103|It was a person.
103|A classmate came back to school who hasn't been here in a long time.
103|Really, now...?
103|So that desk—
103|It's theirs, right?
103|I didn't know we had another classmate.
103|So why shouldn't I come in?
103|Because it's Oikura-san.
103|Oikura Sodachi-san.
103|She's spent these two years studying alone at home.
103|It's almost like she switched places with Tetsujou-sensei.
103|Araragi-kun, you don't get along with her, right?

104|is that I don't really hate Oikura Sodachi at all.
104|Why does she hate me?

104|Now that you say so, it does indeed exude a special atmosphere.
104|Let's go, Araragi.
104|We were headed to the shoe lockers?
104|Right. The shoe lockers.
104|Life sure is strange.
104|You tell me all about Oikura,
104|and you're reunited with her the very next day.
104|How odd of a coincidence.
104|I was pretty surprised.

104|Flashback
104|Naoetsu High School
104|My memories, though spurred to life, are still jumbled.
104|Therefore, let me explain the situation first.
104|Let me explain why I went back to my middle school.
104|You don't get along with her, right?
104|I figured it was best if you braced yourself.
104|No need to worry your little head.
104|We didn't get along, but that was, like, two years ago!
104|I'm completely at ease.
104|Really?
104|But Oikura asked me
104|how you're doing these days,
104|what you're doing these days,
104|and what you're like now.
104|Whether you grew taller, what you eat, when you come to school...
104|That's so specific!
104|It would be weird to not answer, so I answered all the inoffensive questions.
104|INOFFENSIVE
104|I didn't talk about Senjougahara because I was starting to feel uneasy.
104|You should probably look into this before she gets here.
104|But wait, Araragi.
104|I have to speak to Mr. Hoshina about what needs to be done now that she's attending school again.
104|I have to go to the staff room.
104|Do you want to come with me?
104|You're the vice class rep.
104|I'll clear things up between me and Oikura before you get back.
104|There's only half a year until graduation.
104|I want to have a good time until then.
104|Huh?
104|You're Oikura, right?
104|You're Oikura!
104|Oh, my gosh!
104|It was just two years ago,
104|but it feels like an eternity since we were both first years together! You were in my class, Oikura!
104|Do you remember me?
104|I bet you don't.

104|Number two Araragi is very happy.
104|You look well,

104|While I confined myself to my home you were studying, looking into universities, getting a girlfriend...
104|Your life is smooth sailing, huh?
104|Thank you...
104|Thank you?
104|Thank you?!
104|What did I do for you during two years where I didn't even go to school?!
104|I... No, uh...
104|Well, I'm sure you can go to any university you want to.
104|If you want to.
104|No, trust me, I'm struggling.
104|All that undue modesty.
104|You're still good at math, right?
104|You think that you're the one who should be called Euler, right? Not me?
104|I'd say math is my last straw.
104|It's thanks to mathematics
104|that you got a girlfriend.
104|I wouldn't go that f—
104|It's thanks to mathematics!

104|It's a bottomless wellspring of hatred.

104|I see.
104|I get it.
104|You're Araragi's girlfriend.
104|How the mighty have fallen.
104|You can let go, Hanekawa.
104|I'm completely fine.
104|It's no big deal.
104|Are you really fine?
104|No big deal?

104|You've got gall
104|for some sickly girl who couldn't do anything without my help.
104|I guess.
104|I do owe you thanks for what you did for me.
104|You were always very kind to those beneath you.
104|I take it you've recovered from your illness, Senjougahara?
104|Yes. Thank you.
104|And I take it the reason Araragi has his eyes set on university is because you spur him on?
104|If so, you're wasting your time.
104|He will never thank you for what you do.
104|Yeah, perhaps.
104|But I don't really care.
104|I'm not looking for compensation.
104|He and I attending the same university is what I want.
104|I desire nothing more.
104|Araragi...
104|I'll be passing out now too.
104|The rest is in your hands.
104|Er...
104|That's odd.
104|This recollection still doesn't explain why I went to my middle school in your company.
104|Oh come on now, Araragi.
104|Admirable as I am, I went to thank you for what you did yesterday.
104|You explained everything.
104|And this unworthy girl also presumed to suggest you visit your old school.
104|How could I abandon you?
104|I clearly overstepped my bounds, but here we are.
104|Did that really happen?
104|Just open that envelope and the mystery will be lifted, Ougi.
104|Really?
104|Let's see.
104|There is nothing in envelope b.
104|Do you want to switch your selection to envelope c?
104|What does this mean, Araragi?
104|I don't understand it at all.
104|Is this some kind of code?
104|It's not so much a code as a brainteaser.
104|You didn't even look at it.
104|It's a famous brainteaser called the Monty Hall problem.
104|Monty Hall was a game show host.
104|There were three doors labeled A through C.
104|Behind one of the doors was an expensive prize.
104|The player could select one of the three doors.
104|When the player had selected a door, the host would open one of the remaining two doors that didn't contain the prize.
104|With this knowledge in hand, the player was allowed to change their selection.
104|Would they stick to their original selection?
104|Would they change their selection to the other remaining door?
104|This is how it works.
104|What would you do?
104|You picked envelope a.
104|The envelope says that there is nothing in b.
104|Will you change your selection to c?
104|Um...
104|Isn't it irrelevant in terms of probability whether I change or not?
104|The chance that I selected the right one is one in three.
104|I'm assuming that I'm not told b is empty before I choose, of course.
104|That part is true, but switching is still better.
104|You have to change from a to c.
104|Let us open c, then.
104|Is this a map of some description?
104|There seems to be a mark on it.
104|I believe the next logical step is visiting the location marked here.
104|A walk down memory lane,
104|retracing the steps of the young Araragi.
104|Yes.
104|Let's go, Ougi,
104|to the coordinates given by the ma—
104|Huh?
104|Sengoku Nadeko
104|Hmm.
104|I wonder if this building resembles the ruined school building that my uncle slept in during his sojourn here.
104|What do you say, Araragi?
104|It's similar.
104|It looks dangerously close to falling apart.
104|The owners seem to have left it to the elements.
104|I met a girl in this ruin of a building.
104|You're such a mystery.
104|There used to be a nameplate here.
104|People must have been living here at some point.
104|Who knows?
104|I don't know anything about that.
104|I didn't pay attention to that in middle school.
104|Contact at your leisure.
104|Momiji Real Estate LLC
104|Besides, this sign wasn't here last time.
104|The owner must have changed in the five years since then.
104|Let's go in, Araragi.
104|I wouldn't be surprised if the neighbors reported that noise to the police.
104|If the cops show up, I'll talk us out of here by saying we lost our way.
104|Be sure not to contradict me, Araragi.
104|Don't worry. I won't.
104|It's a slightly embarrassing excuse to say you lost your way as a high schooler,
104|but still better than going off the straight path.
104|Going off the straight path?
104|What do you mean?
104|Well, you know, my parents are cops too, so—
104|Your parents are cops?!
104|Huh?
104|Why did I say that?
104|Then we have nothing to worry about.
104|Even if the cops show up on a bicycle, your parents will get us out.
104|My parents wouldn't do that.
104|My parents would want any wrongdoing punished, regardless of whether it was their own son or not.
104|When I was a little kid and did something wrong, my parents dragged me to the nearest police station.
104|To the police station?
104|How terrifying.
104|I wouldn't be surprised if that proved traumatic.
104|You suspect that Oikura unfairly hates you because of the class meeting two years ago.
104|I think you're wrong.
104|Why?
104|Easy.
104|Because she came to school.
104|What do you mean?
104|Hanekawa said it.
104|Ms. Tetsujou went on maternity leave, and almost as though they switched places, Oikura returned to school.
104|Basically,
104|I believe Oikura had to wait for her to disappear from Naoetsu High School before she could to go to school again.
104|You mean she knew who the culprit was all this time?
104|That means the class meeting is connected to her change of personality, but not directly to her hatred for me.
104|It makes sense.
104|As far as her hatred for me is concerned, she hated me from the very moment we met in class 1-3.
104|"I hate the water that thinks it boils without assistance," huh?
104|Basically, Oikura strongly dislikes that you don't know your roots, that you've forgotten them.
104|But isn't that odd in and of itself?
104|To live means to forget.
104|I, for example, hardly remember my elementary and middle school years.
104|It almost feels like I came to be very recently.
104|Came to be very recently...
104|You sound like Bertrand Russell.
104|So why does Oikura hate you, specifically, like you were her mortal enemy?
104|How odd.
104|How mysterious.
104|How strange.
104|How terrifying.
104|Terrifying?
104|Yes, terrifying.
104|Because it is
104|different.
104|Yes.
104|What terrifies us the most are the ones who hate us— attack us—for no reason we can discern.
104|We don't know their goal, and so we can't react.
104|To fight, one must first understand the enemy's sense of justice.
104|What does Oikura Sodachi believe is right?
104|What does she believe is just?
104|This is also a journey to find those answers.
104|This room is in terrible shape.
104|It looks just like it did five years ago.
104|Frozen.
104|It's like time has stopped here.
104|Do you see the small table there?
104|We used that.
104|Used it? For what?
104|Sitting on it?
104|No.
104|I don't really understand anyway.
104|Why did you keep coming back to this dilapidated house over the summer?
104|You're a mysterious man.
104|Did you like adventures that much?
104|All things kids do are mysterious.
104|Little of it can be explained.
104|I don't know why I did it.
104|The way I thought back then was totally different.
104|Why, I have to wonder, do I become so talkative in her company?
104|Even when I could lie or dodge the question,
104|I answer truthfully.
104|I answer in full before I know it.
104|Either way, I began my story
104|of what happened here five years ago.
104|A story of whom I met and what we did.
104|A story of what made Araragi Koyomi who he is.
104|It spoke
104|of me.
104|I hear your laughter beyond the door
104|You were supposed to be with me forever
104|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
104|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
104|I heard your voice from the hallway
104|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
104|At some point I became unable
104|to talk to you normally
104|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
104|You were supposed to be next to me forever
104|You knew how I felt
104|even when I said nothing
104|Now I know how important you were to me,
104|but we will never see each other again
105|Oikura Sodachi hates me.
105|She hates me as though I were her mortal enemy.
105|What puzzles me in relation to all this
105|is that I don't really hate Oikura Sodachi at all.
105|Why does she hate me?
105|How do I not hate her?

105|Let's go, Araragi-senpai.
105|We were headed to the shoe lockers?
105|Right. The shoe lockers.
105|Life sure is strange.
105|You tell me all about Oikura-senpai,
105|and you're reunited with Oikura-senpai the very next day.
105|How odd of a coincidence.
105|Well, I was pretty surprised.
105|I didn't even know that she was in my class.

105|This one?
105|So this was where you changed your shoes every day during your first year in middle school.
105|Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
105|No, it doesn't.
105|What about me changing shoes makes you wonder?
105|Badum.
105|Oh, my.
105|Araragi-senpai, these letters have your name on them.
105|To: Araragi Koyomi in 1-3
105|Flashback
105|Naoetsu High School
105|Though spurred to life, my memories are still jumbled.
105|Therefore, let me first explain the situation.
105|Let me explain why I went back to my middle school.
105|Araragi-kun, you don't get along with her, right?
105|I figured it was best if you braced yourself.
105|No need to worry your little head.
105|We didn't get along, but that was, like, two years ago!
105|I'm completely at ease.
105|Really?
105|But Oikura-san asked me
105|how Araragi-kun's doing these days,
105|what Araragi-kun's doing these days,
105|and what Araragi-kun's like now.
105|Whether you grew taller, what you eat, when you come to school...
105|That's so specific!
105|It would be weird to not answer, so I answered all of the inoffensive questions.
105|INOFFENSIVE
105|I didn't talk about Senjougahara-san because I was starting to feel uneasy.
105|Araragi-kun, Senjougahara-san will be here soon, so you should probably look into this first.
105|But wait, Araragi-kun.
105|Now that Oikura-san's attending school again, I have to speak to Hoshina-sensei about what needs to be done.
105|I have to go to the staff room.
105|Araragi-kun, do you want to come with me?
105|You're the class president.
105|I'll clear things up between me and Oikura before you get back.
105|There's only half a year until graduation.
105|I want to have a good time until then.
105|Huh?
105|You're Oikura, right?
105|Yes, you are Oikura!
105|Oh, my gosh!
105|It was just two years ago,
105|but it feels like an eternity has passed since we were both first years in the same class!
105|Do you remember me?
105|I bet you don't.
105|I was number two on the roster, Araragi.
105|Roster Number

105|Do you think
105|I could ever forget you,
105|Oikura Sodachi
105|Araragi?!
105|How nice of you to remember me.
105|Number two Araragi is very happy.
105|You look well,
105|unlike me.
105|I'm really jealous.
105|While I confined myself to my home, you were studying, looking into universities,
105|getting a girlfriend...
105|Araragi's life is smooth sailing, huh?
105|Thank you...
105|Thank you?
105|Thank you?!
105|What did I do for you during two years when I didn't even go to school?!
105|I... No, uh...
105|Well, I'm sure you can go to any university you want to.
105|If you want to.
105|No, trust me, I'm struggling.
105|All that undue modesty.
105|You're still good at math, right?
105|You think that you're the one who should be called Euler, right? Not me?
105|I'd say math is my last straw.
105|It's thanks to mathematics
105|that you got a girlfriend.
105|I wouldn't go that f—
105|It's thanks to mathematics!
105|People like you make me so upset.
105|I can never hate you enough.
105|Try as I might, disgust keeps welling up.
105|It's a bottomless wellspring of hatred.
105|People like me?
105|Come on, that's a bit extreme.
105|I hate that attitude!
105|You try to keep everything vague!
105|You compromise all the time!
105|You want the status quo!

105|Being pitied by someone like you does me no good.
105|I see.
105|You really...
105|You really hate happy people, huh?
105|I love happy people.
105|Just looking at them makes me happy, too.
105|The people I hate are the ones who don't understand why they're happy.
105|The ones who don't try to understand why they're happy.

105|I hate you.
105|Oikura...
105|It is because people like you crowd this world that I cannot find peace.
105|I hate people who think they can survive without help.
105|Nobody can be happy without the help of others.
105|I hate fools who don't understand that so much that I could die.
105|What has driven her to this?
105|Was it the class meeting?
105|Was it two years of despair?
105|Yeah...
105|Nobody can save themselves.
105|Yeah...
105|I think the same thing basically all of the time.
105|Damned be the thankless fools that try to live on their own.
105|Damn you, Araragi.
105|There is no one more thankless than you.
105|Your justice is self-centered.
105|My justice?
105|Tell me, do you remember what your shoe locker contained during your first year in middle school?
105|See? You don't.
105|You remember nothing, Araragi.

105|We don't know whether

105|or whether she hadn't.

105|Hanekawa apparently had told Senjougahara that Oikura had come to school.
105|And she had rushed to the classroom in short order.
105|I'll kill you.
105|The only one who's allowed to stab Araragi-kun with stationery is me.

105|And Araragi has set his eyes on university because you spur him on?
105|If so, you're wasting your time.
105|He will never thank you for what you do.
105|Yeah, perhaps.

105|That's odd.
105|This recollection still doesn't explain why Ougi-chan accompanied me to my middle school.
105|No way. Come on now, Araragi-senpai.
105|Admirable as I am, I went to thank Araragi-senpai for what he did yesterday.
105|Araragi-senpai, you explained everything.
105|And this unworthy girl also presumed to suggest you visit your old school.
105|How could I abandon you?
105|I clearly overstepped my bounds, but here we are.
105|Did that really happen?
105|Ougi-chan, just open that envelope and the mystery will be lifted.
105|Really?
105|Let's see.
105|There is nothing in envelope b.
105|Will you change your selection to envelope c?
105|Araragi-senpai, what does this mean?
105|I don't understand it at all.
105|Is this some kind of code?
105|It's not so much a code as a brainteaser.
105|You didn't even look at it.
105|It's a famous brainteaser called the Monty Hall problem.
105|Monty Hall was a game show host.
105|A, B, and C labeled three doors.
105|Behind one of the doors was an expensive prize.
105|The player could select one of the three doors.
105|When the player had selected a door, the host would open one of the remaining two doors that didn't contain the prize.
105|With this knowledge in hand, the player was allowed to change their selection.
105|Would they stick to their original selection?
105|Would they change their selection to the other remaining door?
105|This is how it works.
105|Ougi-chan, what would you do?
105|You picked envelope a.
105|It says that envelope b is empty.
105|Will you change your selection to envelope c?
105|Um...
105|Isn't it irrelevant in terms of probability whether I change or not?
105|I have a one in three chance of selecting the right one.
105|I'm assuming that I'm not told that b is empty before I choose, of course.
105|That part is true, but switching is still better.
105|You have to change from a to c.
105|Let us open c, then.
105|Is this a map of some description?
105|There seems to be a mark on it.
105|I believe the next logical step is to visit the location marked here.
105|Araragi-senpai, a walk down memory lane,
105|retracing young Araragi's steps.
105|Yes.
105|Let's go, Ougi-chan,
105|to the coordinates given by the ma—
105|Huh?
105|Sengoku Nadeko
105|Hmm.
105|I wonder if this building resembles the ruined school building that my uncle slept in during his sojourn here.
105|What do you say, Araragi-senpai?
105|It's similar.
105|It looks dangerously close to falling apart.
105|The owners seem to have left it to the elements.
105|I met a girl in this ruin of a building.
105|You're such a mystery.
105|There used to be a nameplate here.
105|People must have lived here at some point.
105|Who knows?
105|I don't know anything about that.
105|I didn't pay attention to that in middle school.
105|Contact at your leisure.
105|Momiji Real Estate LLC
105|Besides, this sign wasn't here last time.
105|The owner must have changed in the five years since then.
105|Let's go in, Araragi-senpai.
105|I wouldn't be surprised if the neighbors reported that noise to the police.
105|If the cops show up, I'll talk us out of here by saying we lost our way.
105|Araragi-senpai, be sure not to contradict me.
105|Don't worry. I won't.
105|It's a slightly embarrassing excuse to say you lost your way as a high schooler,
105|but still better than going off the straight path.
105|Going off the straight path?
105|What do you mean?
105|Well, you know, my parents are cops, too, so—
105|Your parents are cops?!
105|Huh?
105|Why did I say that?
105|Then we have nothing to worry about.
105|Even if the cops show up on a bicycle, Araragi-senpai's parents will get us out.
105|My parents wouldn't do that.
105|My parents would want any wrongdoing punished, regardless of whether it was their own son or not.
105|When I was a little kid and did something wrong, my parents dragged me to the nearest police station.
105|To the police station?
105|How terrifying.
105|I wouldn't be surprised if that proved to be traumatic.
105|Oikura-senpai presumably hates you because of the class meeting two years ago.
105|I think you're wrong.
105|Why?
105|Easy.
105|Oikura-senpai came to school
105|What do you mean?
105|Hanekawa-senpai said it.
105|Tetsujou-sensei went on maternity leave,
105|and almost as though they switched places, Oikura-senpai returned to school.
105|Basically,
105|Oikura-senpai waited for Tetsujou-sensei to disappear from Naoetsu High School before she returned.
105|You mean she knew who the culprit was all this time?
105|That means the class meeting is connected to her change of personality, but not directly to her hatred for me.
105|It makes sense.
105|As far as her hatred for me is concerned, she hated me from the very moment we met in class 1-3.
105|"I hate the water that thinks it boils without assistance," huh?
105|Basically, Oikura-senpai strongly dislikes that you don't know your roots, that you have forgotten your roots.
105|But isn't that odd in and of itself?
105|To live means to forget.
105|I, for example, hardly remember my elementary and middle school years.
105|It almost feels like I came to be very recently.
105|Came to be very recently...
105|You sound like Bertrand Russell.
105|So why does Oikura-senpai hate Araragi-senpai, as if he were her mortal enemy?
105|How odd.
105|How mysterious.
105|How strange.
105|How terrifying.
105|Terrifying?
105|Yes, terrifying.
105|Because it is
105|different.
105|Yes.
105|What terrifies us the most are the ones who hate us— attack us—for no reason we can discern.
105|We don't know their goal, and so we can't react.
105|To fight, one must first understand the enemy's sense of justice.
105|What does Oikura Sodachi believe is right?
105|What does she believe is just?
105|This is also a journey to find those answers.
105|This room is in terrible shape.
105|It looks just like it did five years ago.
105|Frozen.
105|It's like time has stopped here.
105|Do you see the small table there?
105|We used that.
105|Used it? For what?
105|Sitting on it?
105|No.
105|I don't really understand anyway.
105|Why did you keep coming back to this dilapidated house over the summer?
105|You're a mysterious man.
105|Did you like adventures that much?
105|All things kids do are mysterious.
105|Little of it can be explained.
105|I don't know why I did it.
105|The way I thought back then was totally different.
105|Why, in Ougi-chan's company, do I become so talkative?
105|Even when I could lie or dodge the question,
105|I answer truthfully.
105|I answer in full before I know it.
105|Either way, I began my story
105|of what happened here five years ago.
105|A story of whom I met and what we did.
105|A story of what made Araragi Koyomi who he is.
105|It spoke
105|of me.
105|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
105|I hear your laughter beyond the door
105|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
105|You were supposed to be with me forever

105|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name

105|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
105|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara

105|Now I know how important you were to me,
105|me mo awanai
105|but we will never see each other again
106|Five Years Ago
106|Five years ago.
106|What sort of person was Araragi Koyomi back then, in his first year of middle school?
106|He was honest, genuine, and motivated.
106|For all intents and purposes, he was a normal child.
106|If we were to seek something uncommon in one so common,
106|it would be that his parents were policemen and his personality was heavily influenced
106|by justice, peace, and security.
106|You might say he was a boy with an unusually strong sense of justice.
106|Now, five years ago.
106|When the first term was ending, he grew a little restless.
106|Not just a little.
106|Actually, it was a lot.
106|He had just gotten back the grades on his finals, and was disappointed in the results.
106|Especially in mathematics.
106|He couldn't accept it.
106|Being on the right side of history was on the line.
106|Not being right in his studies was a source of embarrassment greater than the bad grade for him.

106|End Story
106|Sodachi Riddle
106|I've always known
106|that words are lies
106|Quickly we forget
106|that which is vague and unclear
106|by escaping into a realm of magic
106|which stifles truth
106|During a sunless summer
106|I derived
106|the answer alone
106|The answer was you
106|I found an answer
106|that I thought was more correct
106|than anybody else
106|Back then, I didn't know anything about the Monty Hall problem,
106|There is nothing in envelope b.
106|Do you want to switch your selection to envelope c?
106|but suddenly being confronted with it piqued my curiosity.
106|No...
106|I didn't solve it.
106|I changed my selection, but I don't know why c is correct.
106|She said she gave the same letters to a few others,
106|but I was the only one who came to this run-down house to meet her.
106|Without even knowing what you were getting into.
106|Without... Yes, I suppose.
106|That summer is what likely prevented me from being bad at math or hating it.
106|I probably wouldn't have been able to get into Naoetsu High School.
106|Please continue your story, Araragi.
106|I want to know more about your summer adventure.
106|About your secret meeting with the mystery girl.
106|So, this is called a Monty Hall problem.
106|That's so interesting!
106|Are there more problems like this?
106|Sure, tons!
106|I'll teach them all to you.
106|I really hope you'll fall in love with math, and that you won't stop loving it.
106|I will love it!
106|I won't stop loving it!
106|Let's study here again tomorrow!
106|From the end of the first term to the end of the summer holidays,
106|I kept coming to this desolate house.
106|I kept studying with the mystery girl.

106|She was also the one who taught me about the most beautiful expression in human history: Euler's identity.
106|Even after all these years, I can recall a lot of formulas that're useless in school off the top of my head.
106|It never really felt like studying to me.
106|I guess it was more like I went to this ruin to hang out.
106|Scene #04.080A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two

106|This was like our secret base, hers and mine.
106|A secret, personal cram school.
106|Cram school, huh?
106|She insisted on this place.
106|She said she'd only meet me here.
106|Scene #04.088A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|That was what she said when we met the next day in the chaos.
106|It was a condition she had.
106|One of three conditions.
106|One, this is where we meet.
106|In this run-down house, on the second floor at the very end.
106|Scene #04.091A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|The second condition was that I would keep our study sessions a secret.
106|And the third condition...
106|Scene #04.093A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|Don't ask me my name.
106|Don't probe into my life.
106|Ask me only about math.

106|Black
106|Those three.
106|She sounds like a math fairy.
106|However, those three were the only things she demanded.
106|Scene #04.103A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|Nothing else at all.
106|Her three conditions and the initial request.
106|I felt bad just being taught all the time and giving nothing back, so I brought candy one day.
106|I'm not looking for compensation.
106|I'm just happy to teach you math.
106|Please!
106|Stay in love with math.
106|Scene #04.112A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|Yep.
106|She sounds even more like a math fairy now.
106|I accepted all her conditions and came here every day.
106|Every single day?
106|Without fail?
106|But one day, it was suddenly over.
106|Scene #04.115A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|It was on the last day of the summer holidays.
106|Normally she would have already been there, preparing our study session,
106|but she wasn't there that day.
106|Scene #04.122B End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|White
106|For the first and only time,
106|no matter how long I waited,
106|she did not appear.
106|An envelope?
106|Araragi Koyomi realized, deep down,
106|that he wouldn't
106|ever learn math from her again here.
106|He went to the other classes to find out who she was.
106|He found that the girl he met over the summer was neither in his grade nor in the grades above him.
106|At the thought of her vanishing along with every trace of her existence,
106|the boy Araragi trembled.
106|He was scared.
106|For the first time, he was afraid of her.
106|That's why he didn't go back to that ruin of a house.
106|That's why he forgot her.
106|However, he never forgot the math she taught him,
106|and starting with the second term his grades recovered with math as the core.
106|While his daily life merely returned to the way it was before he went to that derelict house,
106|and while one less discerning might think nothing changed at all,
106|one thing changed without doubt.
106|He kept on having strong opinions on being in the right,
106|and from time to time this would lead to violence and conflict,
106|but at least he could find enjoyment in numbers.
106|If this had never happened, he surely would have had nothing left in his heart
106|Naoetsu Private High School
106|after the class meeting that destroyed his sense of justice.
106|She taught him that numbers were fun.
106|She taught him that life was fun.
106|She taught him that the world was fun.
106|It's what makes me who I am now.
106|That summer is the fabric of my personality.
106|So, the mystery girl was Oikura, right?
106|Come on, Araragi.
106|This didn't even require a master detective.
106|If she hadn't been Oikura, we would have wasted all this time on a red herring.
106|Is that really fair?
106|All right, Ougi.
106|How do you explain that this girl, the young Oikura Sodachi,
106|wasn't in Nanahyakuichi Middle School when summer was over?
106|She transferred schools.
106|I admit this conjecture has a hole in it.
106|It means that you and she were in the same grade once.
106|However, the way you phrased things so far implied that you only ever met her in high school.
106|Because I thought I had.
106|I forgot that I'd ever met her when we were younger.
106|I forgot why I became good at math,
106|forgot everything I owed her,
106|and treated her like a normal classmate.
106|She said I have mathematics to thank for everything I am today,
106|even that Senjougahara is my girlfriend.
106|Perhaps she was trying to say that it was all thanks to her.
106|"I love happy people, but I hate those that don't understand why they're happy," huh?
106|What was the other thing?
106|"I hate the ones that don't know what makes them who they are?"
106|Now that you remember what you forgot, those words cut deep, don't they?
106|Anyway...
106|I have to apologize to her tomorrow.
106|I doubt that it'll result in a sudden outburst of friendliness,
106|and perhaps it won't make anything easier for her,
106|but I still feel like I have to do it.
106|You don't seem to like the thought.
106|Yeah...
106|Y'know, I can be rightfully upset about a bunch of things myself.
106|Why didn't she tell me she was going to transfer schools?
106|How am I supposed to understand an empty envelope?
106|Oikura Sodachi
106|Besides, all she had to do was remind me about it when we met again later, and I would have remembered.
106|Getting upset now is unreasonable.
106|Remind you, huh?
106|That girl was me, Araragi.
106|Long time no see!
106|Aw, you forgot me?
106|You're awwwful!
106|Sniff...
106|But that's also...
106|really sweeto
106|Is that what you're getting at here?
106|Not a single character in this work has been that magnanimous so far!
106|But...
106|Then...
106|Perhaps you should think hard about why she didn't tell you.
106|And think also about why she left without saying farewell.
106|Otherwise any apology tomorrow is likely to make it worse.
106|Nothing infuriates the victim like half-baked apologies.
106|The victim?
106|Hold on, Ougi.
106|Aren't you exaggerating?
106|Perhaps, yes.
106|Of course it isn't actively your fault.
106|You're just a fool.
106|Always the fool.
106|Ougi. What do you know?
106|I know nothing.
106|You know everything, Araragi.
106|I—
106|Let me follow little Oikura's example and be the quizmaster.
106|Here is your question.
106|Oikura Sodachi hates you as though you were her mortal enemy.
106|That's because you didn't live up to her expectations.
106|That's why she transferred away without saying anything.
106|Now, what did Oikura Sodachi expect of Araragi Koyomi?
106|What she expected?
106|Hint: It's related to your parents' occupation.
106|You have one hundred and twenty seconds.
106|Essentially, Oikura did expect compensation in return for teaching you that math is fun or whatever.
106|Objectively, I must say that the first letter was already sketchy.
106|It seems like it was a trap to me.
106|A trap.
106|Trap
106|You took the bait.
106|That she sent letters to others and you were the only one who showed up was a lie.
106|A big, fat lie.
106|She was always fishing only for you.
106|She knew that your math grades had slipped
106|and seized the opportunity to place envelopes in your shoe locker that were likely to grab your attention.
106|Giving a student worried about his math grade a math problem...
106|It was exceptional bait.
106|So when I showed up without knowing what I was getting into...
106|Hey, Araragi.
106|You know the derelict cram school that my uncle, Oshino Meme, was lodging in rather well, right?
106|Yeah. Like I said.
106|I even crashed there.
106|And you also said this:
106|This empty house and that ruin of a cram school are similarly run-down. Right?
106|I did. So?
106|Don't you think that's weird?
106|Why is a cram school that was abandoned only a few years ago
106|equally as ruined as a house that was already a ruin five years ago?
106|Precisely, Araragi.
106|This wasn't a ruin five years ago.
106|Scene #04.245A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|You mistook it for one.
106|This was where Oikura Sodachi lived.
106|Where she lived?
106|Why was she always here before you?
106|Don't you think it's weird that she would invariably be first to meet you?
106|She was waiting here for you because it was her home.
106|But—
106|Now, Araragi.
106|I'm loath to edge you on, shocked as you are, but now we're getting to the heart of the matter.
106|Why, I wonder, did you think this was a ruin five years ago?
106|I must be misremembering.
106|No, you were mistaken.
106|Your memories are probably accurate.
106|You said the windows were already broken in this room back then.
106|You aren't misremembering. You were mistaken.
106|Domestic violence?
106|Yes.
106|What a wretched childhood Oikura must have had.
106|You are surrounded by warmth and peace at home
106|and confined your time here to the furthest reaches of your memory.
106|Perhaps you shouldn't even be blamed for that.
106|This also explains why she transferred schools when the second term began.
106|Her family finally fell apart for good.
106|Her surname must have changed.
106|I suppose that's the reason you thought you'd never met her before your time in class 1-3.
106|Well, I guess you should have recognized her.
106|Onward.
106|There is little doubt that Oikura faced extraordinary circumstances.
106|She wanted to change that.
106|Change how?
106|Somehow.
106|That was why she invited you.
106|That was the compensation she desired of you.
106|Hold on.
106|How was I going to do something about the violence and escalating discord of her family?
106|What did she expect of someone in his first year of middle school?
106|Not you. Your parents.
106|My parents...
106|They're cops, right?
106|Those parents who instilled such a strong sense of justice in you.
106|She wanted you to report everything you saw here to your parents.
106|Scene #04.287A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|Then why did she make me promise I wouldn't tell anybody?
106|I had to keep it a secret that we were even meeting.
106|She didn't want to indict her own family.
106|Perhaps she was reluctant to accuse her own parents.
106|Scene #04.289A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|White
106|Perhaps she was afraid of their punishment.
106|Both, probably.
106|She was hoping I would stand up and talk to my parents.

106|I didn't live up to her expectations,

106|The empty envelope that Oikura taped to the underside of the table was a metaphor of me.
106|Empty. Wrong door.
106|I proved to be a waste of time.
106|Scene #04.296A End Story 1 - Sodachi Riddle Part Two
106|Black
106|Yes, that seems just about right.
106|Araragi, if my memory serves me right,
106|we started this investigation to establish why Oikura hates you like you were her mortal enemy.
106|We can regard the investigation as largely concluded now.
106|I believe now would be the time to take our leave, but you should be given time to say something as well.
106|Your closing statement.
106|I am really blessed right now.
106|My life really is smooth sailing.
106|I am happy.
106|I have friends, a girlfriend, people who rely on me.
106|I am very, very happy.
106|But—
106|I've started hating myself a little for my happiness.
106|Then I shall love you to even the score.
106|And besides, Araragi.
106|Aren't you glad you haven't started hating math?
106|Damn right.
106|Yes.
106|Whatever I hate, and despite losing my sense of what is right and just, I still love math.
106|By now it may very well be a sort of curse.
106|Oshino Ougi?
106|Oshino's niece?
106|Uh... Yeah.
106|Lots of things have become clear to me thanks to her.
106|I suppose she shares his blood, but she's like a detective or something.
106|Naoetsu Private High School
106|Without her I never would've solved the mysteries yesterday and the day before.
106|Araragi.
106|Honestly, I don't want to pry into this any further,
106|and it's perfectly plausible that she somehow found out you were about to fail math after the finals.
106|She capitalized on that and put the Monty Hall problem in your shoe locker.
106|But all this hinges on the knowledge that your parents are policemen.
106|How did she know that?
106|Usually it takes you a long time to tell that to people.
106|Yes.
106|I made it a habit to never tell anybody of my parents' profession, even when asked,
106|to avoid unnecessary problems.
106|So, how?
106|How did she know?
106|How?
106|Well, I mean, she probably learned it by some sort of coincidence.
106|Isn't there something else?
106|Something that connects you.
106|Something you need to recall.
106|A door you need to open.
106|Something I need to recall.

106|A door I need to open.
106|There's still something I've forgotten.
106|Even now.
106|Just how foolish a man is Araragi Koyomi?
106|Is there no limit to my foolishness?
106|"Do you think I could ever forget you?"
106|Those were Oikura's words.
106|She undoubtedly remembers.
106|She remembers what happened two years ago, five years ago, and also what the fool did before that.
106|I arrived before the classroom.
106|Whether or not Oikura Sodachi was beyond the door was entirely impossible to prove.
106|It was entirely impossible to prove.
106|I hear your laughter beyond the door
106|You were supposed to be with me forever
106|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
106|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
106|I heard your voice from the hallway
106|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
106|At some point I became unable
106|to talk to you normally
106|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
106|You were supposed to be next to me forever
106|You knew how I felt
106|even when I said nothing
106|Now I know how important you were to me,
106|but we will never see each other again
107|Five Years Ago
107|Five years ago.
107|What sort of person was Araragi Koyomi back then, in his first year of middle school?
107|He was honest, genuine, and motivated.
107|For all intents and purposes, he was a normal child.
107|If we were to seek something uncommon in one so common,
107|it would be that his parents were policemen and his personality was heavily influenced
107|by justice, peace, and security.
107|Araragi could be described as a boy with an unusually strong sense of justice.
107|Now, five years ago.
107|When the first term was ending, he grew a little restless.
107|Not just a little.
107|Actually, it was a lot.
107|He had just gotten back the grades on his finals, and was disappointed in the results.
107|Especially in mathematics.
107|He couldn't accept it.
107|Being on the right side of history was on the line.
107|Not being right in his studies was a source of embarrassment greater than the bad grade for him.

107|No...
107|I didn't solve it.
107|I changed my selection, but I don't know why c is correct.
107|She said she gave the same letters to a few others,
107|but I was the only one who came to this run-down house to meet her.
107|Without even knowing what you were getting into.
107|Without... Yes, I suppose.
107|That summer is what likely prevented me from being bad at math or hating it.
107|Naoetsu High School probably wouldn't have accepted me.
107|Please continue your story.
107|Araragi-senpai, I want to know more about your summer adventure.
107|About your secret meeting, Araragi-senpai, with the mystery girl.
107|So, this is called a Monty Hall problem.
107|That's so interesting!
107|Are there more problems like this?
107|Sure, tons!
107|I'll teach them all to you.
107|Araragi-kun, I really hope you'll fall in love with math, and that you won't stop loving it.
107|I will love it!
107|I won't stop loving it!
107|Let's study here again tomorrow!
107|From the end of the first term to the end of the summer holidays,
107|I kept coming to this desolate house.
107|I kept studying with the mystery girl.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|She was also the one who taught me about Euler's identity, the most beautiful expression in human history.
107|Even after all these years, I can recall a lot of formulas that are useless in school off the top of my head.
107|It never really felt like studying to me.
107|I guess it was more like I went to this ruin to hang out.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|This was like our secret base, hers and mine.
107|A secret, personal cram school.
107|Cram school, huh?
107|She insisted on this place.
107|She said she'd only meet me here.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|That was what she said when we met the next day in the chaos.
107|It was a condition she had.
107|One of three conditions.
107|One, this is where we meet.
107|In this run-down house, on the second floor at the very end.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|The second condition was that I would keep our study sessions a secret.
107|And the third condition...
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|Don't ask me my name.
107|Don't probe into my life.
107|Ask me only about math.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|Those three.
107|She sounds like a math fairy.
107|However, those three were the only things she demanded.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|Nothing else at all.
107|Her three conditions and the initial request.
107|I felt bad just being taught all the time and giving nothing back, so I brought candy one day.
107|I'm not looking for compensation.
107|I'm just happy to teach you math.
107|Please!
107|Stay in love with math.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|Yep.
107|She sounds even more like a math fairy now.
107|I accepted all her conditions and came here every day.
107|Every single day?
107|Without fail?
107|But one day, it was suddenly over.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|It was on the last day of the summer holidays.
107|Normally, she would have already been there, preparing our study session,
107|but she wasn't there that day.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|White Scene
107|For the first and only time,
107|no matter how long I waited,
107|she did not appear.
107|An envelope?
107|Deep down, Araragi Koyomi realized
107|that he wouldn't
107|ever learn math from her again here.
107|He went to the other classes to find out who she was.
107|He found that the girl he met over the summer was neither in his grade nor in the grades above him.
107|At the thought of her vanishing along with every trace of her existence,
107|the boy Araragi trembled.
107|He was scared.
107|For the first time, he was afraid of her.
107|That's why he didn't go back to that ruin of a house.
107|That's why he forgot her.
107|However, he never forgot the math she taught him,
107|and starting in the second term, Araragi's grades recovered with math as the core.
107|While his daily life merely returned to the way it was before he went to that derelict house,
107|and while one less discerning might think nothing changed at all,
107|one thing changed without doubt.
107|He kept on having strong opinions on being in the right,
107|and from time to time, this would lead to violence and conflict,
107|but at least he could find enjoyment in numbers.
107|If this had never happened, he surely would have had nothing left in his heart
107|Private Naoetsu High School
107|after the class meeting that destroyed his sense of justice.
107|She taught him that numbers were fun.
107|She taught him that life was fun.
107|She taught him that the world was fun.
107|It's what makes me who I am now.
107|That summer is the fabric of my personality.
107|So, the mystery girl was Oikura-senpai,, right?
107|Come on, Araragi-senpai.
107|This didn't even require a master detective.
107|If she hadn't been Oikura-san, we would have wasted all this time on a red herring.
107|Is that really fair?
107|All right, Ougi-chan.
107|How do you explain that this girl, the young Oikura,
107|wasn't in Nanahyakuichi Middle School after summer ended?
107|She transferred schools.
107|I admit this conjecture has a hole in it.
107|It means that Araragi-senpai and Oikura-senpai were once in the same grade.
107|Araragi-senpai, the way you phrased things so far
107|implied that you only ever met Oikura-senpai in high school.
107|Because I thought I had.
107|I forgot that I'd ever met her when we were younger.
107|I forgot why I became good at math,
107|forgot everything I owed her,
107|and treated her like a normal classmate.
107|She said I have mathematics to thank for everything I am today,
107|even that Senjougahara is my girlfriend.
107|Perhaps she was trying to say that it was all thanks to her.
107|"I love happy people, but I hate those that don't understand why they're happy," huh?
107|What was the other thing?
107|"I hate the ones that don't know what makes them who they are?"
107|Now that you remember what you forgot, those words cut deep, don't they?
107|Anyway...
107|I have to apologize to Oikura tomorrow.
107|I doubt that it'll result in a sudden outburst of friendliness,
107|and perhaps it won't make anything easier for her,
107|but I still feel like I have to do it.
107|You don't seem to like the thought.
107|Yeah...
107|You know, I can be rightfully upset about a bunch of things myself.
107|Why didn't she tell me she was going to transfer schools?
107|How am I supposed to understand an empty envelope?
107|Oikura Sodachi
107|Besides, all she had to do was remind me about it when we met again later, and I would have remembered.
107|Getting upset now is unreasonable.
107|Remind you, huh?
107|That girl was me, Araragi-kun.
107|Long time no see!
107|Aw, you forgot me?
107|You're awful!
107|Sniff...
107|But that's also...
107|really sweeto
107|Is that what you're getting at here?
107|Not a single character in this work has been that magnanimous so far!
107|But...
107|Then...
107|Perhaps you should think hard about why she didn't tell you.
107|And think also about why she left without saying farewell.
107|Otherwise, any apology tomorrow is likely to make it worse.
107|Nothing infuriates the victim like half-baked apologies.
107|The victim?
107|Hold on, Ougi-chan.
107|Aren't you exaggerating?
107|Perhaps, yes.
107|Of course, Araragi-senpai, it isn't actively your fault.
107|Araragi-senpai, you're just a fool.
107|Always the fool.
107|Ougi-chan. What do you know?
107|I know nothing.
107|You know everything, Araragi-senpai.
107|I—
107|Let me follow little Oikura-senpai's example and be the quizmaster.
107|Here is your question.
107|Oikura Sodachi hates Araragi Koyomi as though he were her mortal enemy.
107|That's because you didn't live up to her expectations.
107|That's why she transferred away without saying anything.
107|Now, what did Oikura Sodachi expect of Araragi Koyomi?
107|What she expected?
107|Hint: Araragi Koyomi's parents' occupation is relevant.
107|You have one hundred and twenty seconds.
107|Essentially, Oikura-senpai expected compensation from you, Araragi-senpai,
107|in return for teaching you that math is fun or whatever.
107|Objectively, I must say that the first letter was already sketchy.
107|It seems like it was a trap to me.
107|A trap.
107|Trap
107|You took the bait.
107|That she sent letters to others and you, Araragi-senpai, were the only one who showed up was a lie.
107|A big, fat lie.
107|She was always fishing only for you, Araragi-senpai.
107|Araragi-senpai, knowing that your grades had slipped,
107|Oikura-senpai seized the opportunity
107|to place envelopes in your shoe locker that were likely to grab your attention.
107|Giving a student worried about his math grade a math problem...
107|It was exceptional bait.
107|So when I showed up without knowing what I was getting into...
107|Hey, Araragi-senpai.
107|You know the derelict cram school that my uncle, Oshino Meme, was lodging in rather well, right?
107|Yeah, like I said.
107|I even slept there.
107|And you also said this:
107|This empty house and that ruin of a cram school are similarly run-down. Right?
107|I did. So?
107|Don't you think that's weird?
107|Why is a cram school that was abandoned only a few years ago
107|equally as ruined as a house that was already a ruin five years ago?
107|Precisely, Araragi-senpai.
107|This wasn't a ruin five years ago.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|You mistook it for one.
107|This was where Oikura Sodachi lived.
107|Where she lived?
107|Why was she always here before you?
107|Don't you think it's weird that she would invariably be first to meet you, Araragi-senpai?
107|Oikura-senpai was waiting here for you because it was her home.
107|But—
107|Now, Araragi-senpai.
107|I'm loath to edge you on, shocked as you are, but now we're getting to the heart of the matter.
107|Araragi-senpai, I wonder, why did you think Oikura's house was a ruin five years ago?
107|I must be misremembering.
107|No, you are mistaken.
107|Your memories are probably accurate.
107|You said the windows were already broken in this room back then.
107|You aren't misremembering. You were mistaken.
107|Domestic violence?
107|Yes.
107|What a wretched childhood Oikura-san must have had.
107|You are surrounded by warmth and peace at home, Araragi-senpai,
107|and confined your time here to the furthest reaches of your memory.
107|Perhaps you shouldn't even be blamed for that.
107|This also explains why she transferred schools when the second term began.
107|Her family finally fell apart for good.
107|Her surname must have changed.
107|I suppose that's the reason you, Araragi-senpai,
107|thought you'd never met her before your time in class 1-3.
107|Well, I guess you should have recognized her.
107|Onward.
107|Oikura undoubtedly faced extraordinary circumstances.
107|She wanted to change that.
107|Change how?
107|Somehow.
107|That was why Oikura-senpai invited you.
107|That was the compensation she desired from you, Araragi-senpai.
107|Hold on.
107|How was I going to do something about the violence and escalating discord of her family?
107|What did she expect of someone in his first year of middle school?
107|Not you. Your parents.
107|My parents...
107|They're cops, right?
107|Araragi-senpai, the parents who instilled such a strong sense of justice in you.
107|She wanted you to report everything you saw here to your parents.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|Then why did Oikura make me promise I wouldn't tell anybody?
107|Oikura made me keep it a secret that we were even meeting.
107|Oikura-senpai didn't want to indict her own family.
107|Perhaps she was reluctant to accuse her own parents.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|White Scene
107|Perhaps she was afraid of their punishment.
107|Both, probably.
107|Oikura hoped I would stand up and talk to my parents.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|I didn't live up to Oikura's expectations,
107|but I still sponged up all the knowledge that Oikura fed me.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|Oikura's empty envelope, taped to the underside of the table, was a metaphor of me.
107|Empty. Wrong door.
107|I proved to be a waste of time.
107|Owarimonogatari Episode Four, Sodachi Riddle, Part Two
107|Black Scene
107|Yes, that seems just about right.
107|Araragi-senpai, if my memory serves me right,
107|we started this investigation to establish why Oikura-senpai hates Araragi-senpai
107|as if he were her mortal enemy.
107|We can regard the investigation as largely concluded now.
107|I believe now would be the time to take our leave, but you shall be given time to say something as well.
107|Your closing statement.
107|I am really blessed right now.
107|My life really is smooth sailing.
107|I am happy.
107|I have friends, a lover, people who rely on me.
107|I am very, very happy.
107|But—
107|I've started hating myself a little for my happiness.
107|Then I shall love you to even the score.
107|And besides, Araragi-senpai.
107|Aren't you glad you haven't started hating math?
107|That's right.
107|Yes.
107|Whatever I hate, and despite losing my sense of what is right and just, I still love math.
107|By now, it may very well be a sort of curse.
107|Oshino Ougi?
107|Oshino-san's niece?
107|Uh... Yeah.
107|Lots of things have become clear to me thanks to her.
107|I suppose she shares Oshino's blood, but she's like a detective or something.
107|Naoetsu Private High School
107|Front gates of Naoetsu High School
107|Without her, I never would've solved the mysteries yesterday and the day before.
107|Araragi-kun.
107|Honestly, Araragi-kun, I don't want to pry into this any further,
107|and, Araragi-kun, it's perfectly plausible
107|that she somehow found out you were about to fail math after the finals.
107|She capitalized on that and put the Monty Hall problem in your shoe locker.
107|But all this hinges on the knowledge that your parents are policemen.
107|How did Oikura-san know that?
107|Usually, Araragi-kun, it takes you a long time to tell that to people.
107|Yes.
107|I made it a habit to never tell anyone of my parents' profession, even when asked,
107|to avoid unnecessary problems.
107|So, how?
107|How did Oikura know?
107|How?
107|Well, I mean, she probably learned it by some sort of coincidence.
107|Isn't there something else?
107|Something that connects Araragi-kun to Oikura-san.
107|Something you two need to recall.
107|A door you need to open.
107|Something I need to recall.

107|Just how foolish a man is Araragi Koyomi?
107|Is there no limit to my foolishness?
107|"Do you think I could ever forget you?"

108|What lies ahead when everything's lost?
108|I should've let it all go ages ago,
108|but I kept pushing my expectations onto you.
108|I kept diving into the sea of possibilities in search of the slimmest of chances.
108|But it seems you'll never realize
108|what exactly it is that I'm made of.
108|I leave myself in your hands, smiling innocently
108|for this unknown future is just beginning.
108|We will definitely solve the equation
108|which defines us
108|no matter how many mistakes we make.
108|Did you remember, Araragi?
108|Why Oikura knew about your parents' occupation?
108|Yeah, I did.
108|I asked Sengoku to make sure.
108|I doubt it's something so bad that you have to hang your head in shame.
108|It makes me want to hang it in shame.
108|I couldn't remember anything, no matter how hard I tried,
108|but when I did what you recommended, it came to be in a blink.
108|Honestly, you know everything, don't you, Hanekawa?
108|I don't know everything.
108|I just know what I know.
108|That's why I don't know the things Ougi knows.
108|We're fine, right? She's not tailing us, right?
108|Tailing us?
108|No, don't worry. She's not an assassin or something.
108|An assassin?
108|Tailing the suspect is a detective's job, Araragi.
108|I think I would've liked for her to tail us, actually.
108|We could have shaken her off if she'd tried.
108|Don't you think you're being too nervous?
108|Well, Araragi.
108|If she's not tailing us, she might have gone on ahead.
108|She knows where we're going.
108|That's a safe bet if she wants to know what we're doing.
108|I'm not being too nervous.
108|If that's not it, then you're just overestimating Oshino Ougi.
108|I mean, she's Oshino Meme's niece and seems to be pretty smart,
108|but don't you think she's still kind of a child,
108|kind of immature,
108|kind of cute?
108|It's our job as her elders to make sure she doesn't end up like Oshino.
108|That way, we can pay back some of our debt to him, too.
108|Pay back our debt to Oshino, huh?
108|Yes, that's very admirable.
108|I'm moved.
108|And there I was, fearing you were yet again head over heels for some cute girl you just met.
108|"Yet again?"
108|Didn't something similar happen when you met Kanbaru?
108|If you're serious about what you just said,
108|then just refrain from fussing over younger girls in a way people could misconstrue.
108|I need you to help me put the class back in order right now.
108|I will keep it in mind.
108|That will suffice.
108|Let me ask this to make sure.
108|Until you tagged along on Ougi's investigation,
108|you didn't remember anything about yourself and Oikura in middle school?
108|Uh... No, no. It's the other way around.
108|Ougi tagged along on my investigation.
108|Ougi just went with me.
108|She just helped me remember Oikura.
108|You're misunderstanding what I mean.
108|Maybe I'm not finding the right words.
108|The way I see it, no other girl is that dangerous.
108|Dangerous? You mean Oikura?
108|See? We're just not on the same wavelength.
108|It's like you're dodging the topic on purpose.
108|Well, whatever.
108|I suppose you're not able to talk about it right now.
108|Hanekawa. Are you thinking Ougi might bear Oikura some kind of ill will?
108|I'm pretty sure that's not the case.
108|They've never even met.
108|That isn't what I'm worried about.
108|I'm not worried in the slightest that Ougi has her eyes on Oikura.
108|The one I'm worried about is—
108|Is?
108|—is you, Araragi.
108|Something we understand poorly might have its eyes set on you.
108|Something we understand poorly?
108|Or something that's just bad.
108|Frankly, I'm not sure if I can protect you.
108|Protect—
108|You told me that what happened during summer break was hell itself.
108|But this might only be the beginning of your Passion.

108|We don't have that much time, so we should split up.
108|Which one do you want to visit?
108|Senjougahara or Oikura?
108|You can decide freely.
108|Should I visit my girlfriend?
108|Should I visit my mortal enemy?
108|After some deliberation over this extraordinary decision, I chose the latter.
108|Then perhaps you're wondering why, after having decided to split up, I went there together with Hanekawa?

108|Here are the particulars.
108|Hey. If it isn't Araragi.
108|Ougi...
108|On your way home, Ougi?
108|Home?
108|Uh, no.
108|What are you talking about, Araragi?
108|We promised to meet here, didn't we?
108|Didn't we promise we'd meet here, in front of the school, at 3:42 PM?
108|How commendable.
108|You're right on time.
108|Sometimes you can be reliable and punctual—
108|even as a fool.
108|Gosh, I sure am happy.

108|Never would I have thought that Araragi would treat me to really nice sushi.
108|I promised you that?!
108|Of course you did.
108|You said it would be my welcoming party.
108|Expensive sushi as a welcoming party?
108|Just what is being welcomed here at my school?
108|I'm sorry, Ougi.
108|I regret to say that I don't believe I can keep our promise.
108|Oh, my.
108|What makes you say something so dashing?
108|Even as you break our promise, you show off.
108|Are you broke or something?
108|I have to go to Oikura's house now, Ougi.
108|To that decrepit ruin?
108|No, where she actually lives now.
108|I've become
108|way too talkative
108|I've become
108|in front of Ougi.
108|way too talkative
108|What are you doing?!
108|I opened the zipper on your mouth.
108|It was more like adhesive tape, actually.
108|Please, tell me more.
108|What happened?
108|You seem to be well on your way down Sodachi's route.
108|Slow and steady wins the race.
108|Tell me what happened since we last met,
108|fool.
108|I'm not trying to woo her or anything.
108|She didn't really consent to this visit, you see?
108|She stopped coming to school again yesterday.
108|Even the day before yesterday she might as well not have been there.
108|I was forced to explain.
108|Naoetsu Private High School
108|So it went.
108|So it went, huh?
108|I don't really know what's going on exactly,
108|but it looks like she's not living with her parents anymore.
108|Without her parents?
108|Then I assume some other relative is her guardian?
108|No, she's living alone.
108|Well, isn't that fascinating?
108|I think you were right about what happened five years ago. Her parents probably divorced.
108|Her family imploded.
108|Then she came back here two years ago.
108|I see.
108|So my wild theory turned out to be spot on.
108|But, Araragi, my wonderful fool.
108|Am I to presume that you're now going to visit Oikura, a girl that lives all alone?
108|This will not do.
108|It won't?
108|Not at all.
108|It is unbecoming of a gentleman.
108|Many will craft theories about your relationship if you visit her alone.
108|It's really not something you should do when you have a girlfriend.
108|You seem quite determined.

108|So long, Ougi.
108|Oh, I know.

108|You do know that I'm a great listener.
108|We might be able to extract all sorts of stories from Oikura.

108|I can only conclude that your genius has declined since its heyday.
108|Hey, Ougi.
108|Is this really warranted?
108|You're clearly going too far.
108|What do you even know about her?
108|I don't know anything.
108|You know everything, Araragi.
108|You know her past, her present, and her future, too.
108|You are correct. I have no right to interrupt your narration.

108|I'm not stupid enough to try competing with you.

108|Rest easy.
108|If you don't wish to see your beloved friend Araragi asking a younger girl for help, we can change the rules.
108|I mean, I suggested it to begin with.
108|I will simply accompany him of my own accord.
108|Like a spirit guide.
108|Does that sound acceptable?
108|You know, I'll be like those uninvited sidekicks you see so often in mystery novels.
108|Uninvited sidekicks?
108|How could I abandon Araragi to his tribulations?
108|I want to save Araragi.
108|People can only save themselves,
108|right?
108|That's my uncle's stance.
108|My own stance would be the like The Grateful Crane.
108|The Grateful Crane?
108|Or perhaps Six Little Statues.
108|Essentially, I hold that debts must be repaid many times over.
108|A lot of interest!
108|You see?
108|Araragi was very kind to me after I transferred here.
108|I would like to repay that debt even at risk to myself.
108|Araragi.
108|The plan has changed.
108|I'm going to see Oikura.
108|Together with you, Araragi.
108|Ougi, that would be enough, right?
108|You didn't like that Araragi, a man, was going to a girl's house alone.
108|If I accompany him, we have no problem.
108|No excuse for you.
108|Isn't that right?
108|Problem or not, shouldn't you be going to see Senjougahara, Hanekawa?
108|It isn't very nice
108|to leave your dear friend for later.
108|I always expected it would take a little longer.
108|I'll just sleep at her place later.
108|It's been a while since the last pajama party.
108|You should be fine with that.
108|I am, after all, more capable than you.
108|Merely being capable isn't enough to solve everything in this world.
108|You can also be too capable and damage the balance.
108|The middle ground is important.
108|I believe you know that very well.
108|Well, for better or worse, Araragi is the one who decides this, not me.
108|Will you go with me?
108|Will you go with Hanekawa?
108|Please decide, Araragi.
108|You have full authority.
108|Both Hanekawa and I will obey your decision without fail.

108|I didn't even recognize her at first.

109|which defines us
109|nandodemo mata machigainagara
109|no matter how many mistakes we make.
109|Did you remember, Araragi-kun?
109|Why Oikura-san knew about your parents' occupation, Araragi-kun?
109|Yeah, I did.
109|I asked Sengoku to make sure.
109|I doubt it's something so bad that you have to hang your head in shame.
109|It makes me want to hang it in shame.
109|I couldn't remember anything, no matter how hard I tried,
109|but when I did what you recommended, Hanekawa, it came to me in a blink.
109|You sure know everything, don't you?
109|It's not that I know everything.
109|I just know what I know.
109|That's why I don't know the things Ougi-chan knows.
109|We're fine, right? She's not tailing us, right?
109|Tailing us?
109|No, don't worry. She's not an assassin or something.
109|An assassin?
109|Tailing the suspect is a detective's job, Araragi-kun.
109|I think I would've liked for her to tail us, actually.
109|We could have shaken her off if she'd tried.
109|Don't you think you're being too nervous?
109|Well, Araragi-kun.
109|If she's not tailing us, she might have gone on ahead.
109|She knows where we're going.
109|That's a safe bet if she wants to know what we're doing.
109|I'm not being too nervous.
109|If that's not it, Hanekawa, then you're just overestimating Ougi-chan.
109|I mean, she's Oshino Meme's niece and seems to be pretty smart,
109|but don't you think she's still kind of a child,
109|kind of immature,
109|kind of cute?
109|It's our job as her elders to make sure she doesn't end up like Oshino.
109|That way, we can pay back some of our debt to Oshino, too.
109|Pay back our debt to Oshino-san, huh?
109|Yes, that's very admirable.
109|I'm moved.
109|And there I was, Araragi-kun, fearing you were yet again head over heels for some cute girl you just met.
109|"Yet again?"
109|Didn't meeting Kanbaru-san result in something similar, Araragi-kun?
109|If you're serious about what you just said,
109|then just refrain from fussing over younger girls in a way people could misconstrue.
109|I need you to help me put the class back in order right now.
109|I will keep it in mind.
109|That will suffice.
109|Let me ask this to make sure.
109|Araragi-kun, until you tagged along on Ougi-chan's investigation,
109|you didn't remember anything about yourself and Oikura-san in middle school?
109|Uh... No, no. It's the other way around.
109|Ougi-chan tagged along on my investigation.
109|Ougi-chan just went with me.
109|She just helped me remember Oikura.
109|You're misunderstanding what I mean.
109|Maybe I'm not finding the right words.
109|The way I see it, no other girl is that dangerous.
109|Dangerous? You mean Oikura?
109|See? We're just not on the same wavelength.
109|Araragi-kun, it's like you're dodging the topic on purpose.
109|Well, whatever.
109|I suppose you're not able to talk about it right now.
109|Hanekawa. Are you thinking Ougi-chan might bear Oikura some kind of ill will?
109|I'm pretty sure that's not the case.
109|To begin with, Ougi-chan and Oikura have never met.
109|That isn't what I'm worried about, Araragi-kun.
109|Ougi-chan having her eyes on Oikura isn't what's been worrying me.
109|The one I'm worried about is—
109|Is?
109|—is you, Araragi-kun.
109|Something we understand poorly might have its eyes set on you.
109|Something we understand poorly?
109|Or something that's just bad.
109|Frankly, I'm not sure if I can protect you.
109|Protect—
109|Araragi-kun, you told me that what happened during summer break was hell itself.
109|But, Araragi-kun, this might only be the beginning of your agony.
109|And so, class president Hanekawa Tsubasa and vice president Araragi Koyomi arrived at their destination.

109|Okay, Araragi-kun.
109|Basically, I want to check up on those two after school.

109|Black Scene
109|Senjougahara-san and Oikura-san.
109|We don't have that much time, so we should split up.
109|Senjougahara-san or Oikura-san?
109|Who do you want to visit?
109|Araragi-kun, you can decide freely.
109|Should I visit my girlfriend?
109|Should I visit my mortal enemy?
109|After some deliberation over this extraordinary decision, I chose the latter.
109|Then perhaps you're wondering why, after having decided to split up, Hanekawa and I went there together?
109|Her Agony
109|Here are the details.
109|Araragi-senpai is here.
109|Ougi-chan...
109|Ougi-chan, on your way home?
109|Home?
109|Uh, no.
109|What are you talking about, Araragi-senpai?
109|We promised to meet here, didn't we?
109|Didn't we promise that we'd meet at 3:42 PM here, in front of the school?
109|As expected of you, Araragi-senpai.
109|You're right on time.
109|Sometimes you can be reliable and punctual—
109|even as a fool.
109|Front gates of Naoetsu High School
109|Gosh, I sure am happy.
109|Naoetsu Private High Scho
109|Never would I have thought that Araragi-senpai would treat me to really nice sushi.
109|I promised you that?!
109|Of course you did.
109|Front gates of Naoetsu High School
109|You said it would be my welcoming party.
109|Expensive sushi as a welcoming party?
109|Just what is being welcomed here at my school?
109|I'm sorry, Ougi-chan.
109|I regret to say that I don't believe I can keep our promise.
109|Oh, my.
109|What makes you say something so dashing?
109|Even as you break our promise, you show off.
109|Are you broke or something?
109|I have to go to Oikura's house now, Ougi-chan.
109|To that decrepit ruin?
109|No, where she actually lives now.
109|I've become
109|way too talkative
109|I've become
109|in front of Ougi.
109|way too talkative
109|What are you doing?!
109|I opened the zipper on your mouth.
109|It was more like adhesive tape, actually.
109|Please, tell me more.
109|What happened?
109|You seem to be well on your way down Oikura-senpai's route.
109|Slow and steady wins the race.
109|Tell me what happened since we last met,
109|fool.
109|I'm not trying to woo her or anything.
109|She didn't really consent to this visit, you see?
109|She stopped coming to school again yesterday.
109|Even the day before yesterday, she might as well not have been there.
109|I was forced to explain.
109|Naoetsu Private High School
109|So it went.
109|So it went, huh?
109|I don't really know exactly what's going on,
109|but it looks like she's not living with her parents anymore.
109|Without her parents?
109|Then I assume some other relative is her guardian?
109|No, she's living alone.
109|Well, isn't that fascinating?
109|I think you were right about what happened to Oikura five years ago. Her parents probably divorced.
109|Her family imploded.
109|Then she came back here two years ago.
109|I see.
109|So my wild theory turned out to be spot on.
109|But, Araragi-senpai. My wonderful fool, Araragi-senpai.
109|Araragi-senpai, am I to presume that you're now going to visit a girl that lives all alone?
109|This will not do.
109|It won't?
109|Not at all.
109|It is unbecoming of a gentleman.
109|Many will craft theories about your relationship if you visit her alone.
109|It's really not something you should do when you have a girlfriend.
109|You seem quite determined.
109|I was really looking forward to that expensive sushi restaurant.
109|So long, Ougi-chan.
109|Oh, I know.
109|I just had a very good idea, Araragi-senpai.
109|I will accompany you on your visitation.
109|You would, Ougi-chan?
109|That's good, but...
109|Owarimonogatari Episode Five, Sodachi Lost, Part One
109|Black Scene
109|Visiting her alone is the crux.
109|Considering that I, too, am a girl,
109|I believe I can console Oikura-senpai to some degree.
109|She's not the sort to be consoled by just any girl.
109|You do know that I'm a great listener.
109|We might be able to extract all sorts of stories from Oikura-senpai.
109|Extract?
109|Araragi-senpai, you recalled the class meeting and what happened in middle school.
109|You remember what she was like back then,
109|but you still can't talk to her normally.
109|I can be the relay between you two so it doesn't get out of hand.

109|All right, Ougi-chan. Please help me.
109|All right.
109|I've been asked to help.
109|Don't ask her!
109|Naoetsu Private High School
109|Don't ask her to help, Araragi-kun.
109|Hanekawa?
109|Do you really want to bother an underclassman with our private affairs?
109|Oh. So that's what you mean? That's the reason?
109|Indeed, it's not a good thing to rope outsiders into a private affair.
109|Ougi-chan—
109|Hold on, hold on.
109|There is no need to be shy, Araragi-senpai.
109|That would hurt my feelings.
109|Please, don't worry about me.
109|I don't mind at all.
109|Don't hold back.
109|I'm shocked you would be so cold to me.

109|Araragi-senpai, don't ruin our relationship.
109|And what kind of relationship would that be?
109|Didn't you and Araragi-kun only meet three days ago?
109|Yes, we did.
109|But the depth of one's relationship is not a function of time.
109|Why, I feel like Araragi-senpai and I really hit it off in no time at all.
109|We were locked in a classroom together.
109|We explored a ruin.
109|We have so many unusual memories together.
109|Right, Araragi-senpai?
109|Yeah...
109|Yes, I've been informed.
109|Araragi-kun, my dear friend, seems to be in your debt.
109|Let me thank you.
109|But if I had been with him, I'd have done a better job.
109|Is that so?
109|I suppose it must be.
109|Hanekawa-senpai, I'm sure you would have done better.
109|You are a genius, after all.
109|Yes, my uncle has told me.
109|Your uncle... Oshino-san, you mean?
109|Yes. I am his niece.
109|Owarimonogatari Episode Five, Sodachi Lost, Part One
109|Red Scene
109|But what is the benefit of genius unused?
109|The one who was actually there to help him was I.
109|I hear even my uncle was afraid of your genius.
109|The way I see it, it isn't as remarkable as I was told.
109|You see, from the stories I would have assumed you would come to Araragi-senpai's aid in a time of peril.
109|I can only conclude that your genius has declined since its heyday.
109|Hey, Ougi-chan.
109|Is this really warranted?
109|You're clearly going too far.
109|What do you even know about Hanekawa?
109|I don't know anything.
109|You know everything, Araragi-senpai.
109|You know Hanekawa-senpai's past, present, and future, too.
109|You are correct. I have no right to interrupt your narration.
109|Anyway, Hanekawa-senpai.
109|I'm not stupid enough to compete with you.
109|I also have no wish to belittle you and be hated by Araragi-senpai in return.
109|Let us go our separate ways again.
109|Please.
109|Owarimonogatari Episode Five, Sodachi Lost, Part One
109|Black Scene
109|Were you not on your way to Senjougahara-senpai's house?
109|Her house is farther away, so I recommend you be on your way.
109|Farther?
109|Rest easy.
109|If you don't wish to see your beloved friend Araragi-senpai asking a younger girl for help,
109|we can change the rules.
109|I mean, I suggested it to begin with.
109|I will simply accompany Araragi-senpai of my own accord.
109|Like a spirit guide.
109|Does that sound acceptable?
109|You know, I'll be like those uninvited sidekicks you see so often in mystery novels.
109|Uninvited sidekicks?
109|How could I abandon Araragi-senpai to his tribulations?
109|I want to save Araragi-senpai.
109|People can only save themselves,
109|isn't that right?
109|That's my uncle's stance.
109|My own stance would be like The Grateful Crane.
109|The Grateful Crane?
109|Or perhaps Six Little Statues.
109|Essentially, I hold that debts must be repaid many times over.
109|A lot of interest!
109|You see?
109|Araragi-senpai was very kind to me after I transferred here.
109|Even at risk to myself, I would like to repay that debt.
109|Araragi-kun.
109|The plan has changed.
109|I'm going to see Oikura-san.
109|Araragi-kun, together with you.
109|That would be enough, right, Ougi-chan?
109|You didn't like that Araragi-kun, a man, was going to a girl's house alone.
109|If I accompany him, we have no problem.
109|No excuse for you.
109|Isn't that right?
109|Problem or not, shouldn't you be going to see Senjougahara-senpai, Hanekawa-senpai?
109|It isn't very nice
109|to leave your dear friend for later.
109|I always expected visiting Senjougahara-san would take a little longer.
109|I'll just sleep at her place later.
109|It's been a while since the last pajama party at Senjougahara-san's house.
109|You should be fine with that.
109|I am, after all, more capable than you.
109|Merely being capable isn't enough to solve everything in this world.
109|You can also be too capable and damage the balance.
109|The middle ground is important.
109|I believe you know that very well.
109|Well, for better or worse, the one who decides this is not me, but Araragi-senpai.
109|Will you go with me?
109|Will you go with Hanekawa-senpai?
109|Araragi-senpai, please decide.
109|You have full authority.
109|Both Hanekawa-senpai and I will obey your decision without fail.
109|Right?
109|Yes.
109|Araragi-kun, decide.
109|We can't force ourselves on you.
109|You know, Araragi-senpai.
109|You owe so much to her.
109|How could you burden Hanekawa-senpai with even more of your petty problems?
109|Come to think of it, Hanekawa-senpai has nothing to do with this private affair, either.
109|Hanekawa-senpai doesn't need her life made more difficult, right, Araragi-senpai?
109|I promise you, Araragi-senpai.
109|If you go with me, then I promise I will solve whatever mysteries may lie in wait there for us.
109|If you promise so much...
109|Owarimonogatari Episode Five, Sodachi Lost, Part One
109|Black Scene
109|I promise you, Araragi-kun,
109|that if you go with me
109|I'll let you touch my boobs.
109|Oikura
109|Number 444 here, huh?
109|The property management firm doesn't seem very dutiful.
109|It's just a cheap apartment block.
109|Oikura-san probably receives some kind of subsidy.
109|Subsidy?
109|Yeah, welfare.
109|And they put her into this apartment building.
109|I now recall the budding relationship that Oikura and I had in grade school.
109|But why did I forget something even Sengoku remembered?
109|No, I didn't forget it.
109|The more I think about it, I might just be a really cold person.
109|I had forgotten about Sengoku, too.
109|I didn't even recognize her at first.
109|I think that's fairly normal.
109|Neither Sengoku-chan nor Oikura-san left a lasting impression on you at the time.
109|All right, Araragi-kun. Wait here.
109|On the stairs?
109|Why?
109|Because Oikura-san lives alone.
109|What if she answered the door in her pajamas or a t-shirt?
109|Araragi-kun, she might be embarrassed to be seen by you in those.
109|Owarimonogatari Episode Five, Sodachi Lost, Part One
109|Black Scene
109|Who's there?
109|Honestly, what was going on there during that terrifying showdown?
109|I'm sure many have misunderstood, but Hanekawa's bosom is not why I chose her as my partner over Ougi-chan.
109|Only something extraordinary would have driven Hanekawa to offer that.
109|That's why I chose her as my partner.
109|Ougi-chan has my sympathy.
109|I have to be nice to her later.
109|Yes, I'll help her. I can do it.
109|Maybe a high-class sushi restaurant is too much for now, but a budget sushi place sounds good.
109|Araragi-kun...
109|It's fine. You go in.
109|Really? But...
109|You can go in.
109|Let me spoil the surprise right now.
109|She is in fact wearing her pajamas.
109|Weren't you trying to avoid that?
109|"Araragi visiting is not worth going through the trouble of changing."
109|I tried to convince her, but she became more stubborn by the minute.
109|"I won't change."
109|"Pester me any more and I'll talk to him naked."
109|I lost.
109|Don't worry.
109|Not even I am so superficial that I'd get excited over a girl in her pajamas in such a grave situation.
109|Really, now?
109|You're here for my breasts, aren't you?
109|When the fortress throws open its gates, it must be stormed.
109|I must accept the challenge, even if the open gates bespeak a declaration of war.
109|That is my lot as Oikura Sodachi's childhood friend.
109|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru

110|Be silent.
110|I'd like to thank all of you for buying the DVD or Blu-Ray of
110|Owarimonogatari: Sodachi Lost.
110|I am Oikura Sodachi, a former student at Naoetsu High.
110|At this time, we shall commence the commentary track.
110|Huh? Wait a minute, are you really going to start this like a class meeting?
110|Be silent.
110|Well this is a novel way to start the commentary.
110|Until the recording session is complete,
110|I do not intend to let anyone leave this booth.
110|I figured as much.
110|All rise!
110|We're standing? For the commentary?
110|Attention!
110|You're the one who should be paying attention.
110|And "former student at Naoetsu High?"
110|That's a pretty sad profile description.
110|Good morning, everyone. How are you?
110|This was supposed to be English class?
110|I'm fine, thank you. And you?
110|Me too. Thank you. Sit down, please.
110|What's this? A brand-new kind of commentary is trying to happen.
110|Be silent.
110|I will repeat myself,
110|but I will not allow anyone to leave this booth until recording is over,
110|so just remain there.
110|You haven't learned a single thing.
110|And like her... or not...
110|I am Senjougahara Hitagi, a current student at Naoetsu High.
110|The concludes the avant-title.
110|This is the opening. Be silent.
110|Can't you say anything other than "Be silent?"
110|And can't you say "Be silent" more silently?
110|Be quiet!
110|Quit it with the English lessons. Why are you so high-strung?
110|You're full of gas again.
110|I'm not full of gas. I'm running on empty.
110|I wonder about that.
110|Be quiet!
110|I will warn you until I've gone hoarse!
110|T/N: "garagara" can mean "empty" or "hoarse."
110|Please don't blow out your voice during the commentary. Can't you calm down now that it's just the two of us?
110|From my perspective, it's you and the others who are fooling around too much.
110|I do not intend to let you continue your shenanigans from the commentaries prior to mine.
110|Do you want to get kicked out again?
110|I was not "kicked out." I left of my own volition.
110|And you returned of your own volition.
110|They depicted your departing scene so beautifully; it's a wonder you can come crawling back so shamelessly.
110|I'm so embarrassed!
110|I want to die! I want to disappear!
110|Quit hitting the mic with your head.
110|You're singing this song, right?
110|You may be the first person who's sung two songs in one season.
110|I thought the same thing about Ougi-san, but I didn't realize you sang.
110|I'm so embarrassed!
110|I want to die! I want to disappear!
110|Stop that. You should be more embarrassed about having twintails despite being in high school.
110|You sure have some nasty ways of hurting people. Don't attack my hair.
110|You calm down when attacked. You've got a strange personality.
110|What is this commentary going to be like?
110|Plus we're doing three of them today.
110|The opening is finished.
110|Part A is starting. Be silent.
110|What do you intend to do if I actually were to stay silent?
110|Wouldn't that be like boycotting the commentary?
110|Do you want to be boycotted again?
110|Don't say "again." Raise your hand before speaking.
110|What kind of commentary is this?
110|Excuse me!
110|You may speak, Senjougahara-san.
110|Question: what did you write in that letter?
110|You're going to start with that?
110|Well, I had to ask.
110|It's been burning in the minds of everyone who's seen Sodachi Lost.
110|If we can clear up that point, then this commentary will have served its purpose.
110|After that, we can content ourselves by talking about ants.
110|We will not be talking about ants.
110|I am not an ant.
110|I am not an ant!
110|What kind of trauma are you carrying?
110|There is absolutely no way I'm going to be crushed like an ant. I'll crush them before they crush me!
110|Seems like you're doing this commentary with your previous personality intact.
110|Oh, but now that I think about it, I guess you were never rehabilitated before leaving town.
110|You simply left town after running out of money.
110|Don't imply that I left simply because I ran out of money.
110|Well, I know I'm famous for only watching the scenes I appear in,
110|but I actually watched the whole thing this time.
110|I actually studied all three parts of Sodachi Lost because I didn't know what kind of commentary it would become.
110|Of course, I didn't expect it to be like this.
110|Don't talk to me like I'm a dumpster diver.
110|I'm only speaking the truth.
110|Sodachi Lost was fun to watch.
110|O-oh... y-you think so?
110|You're not used to praise.
110|But I'll have you know that I wasn't trying to flatter you,
110|because I watched it while laughing hysterically.
110|That's what you meant by "fun?" Normal people wouldn't laugh, you know?
110|Oh please. Even I burst out laughing sometimes.
110|It's not good to tie yourself down to a character archetype like that.
110|If you keep doing stuff like that, it's no surprise that you'd turn out that way.
110|Don't put it like that.
110|So anyway, I was howling with laughter as I was watching your tale of woe.
110|You were howling with laughter despite knowing it was a sad tale?
110|You are seriously the worst.
110|Now that my part of Owarimonogatari has concluded, I've been made to look like some kind of psychopath.
110|And this is despite the fact that you're far more likely to go postal on someone.
110|Be silent.
110|How's that? Did I sound similar?
110|Stay with me here! And yes, you did sound similar.
110|Aww yiss.
110|Don't "Aww yiss" me! It sounded so similar it makes me sick.
110|Oh? It seems like you're as witty as Araragi-kun.
110|You two are so similar, seeing as you were childhood friends and all.
110|Why are you twirling your twintails like that?
110|I was not twirling my twintails!
110|Who on earth would react angrily like that?
110|I know you don't think Araragi and I are at all similar, so quit saying that just to hurt me!
110|People think you're more dangerous than me because you say stuff like that!
110|Well, this may be crude of me to say so, but seeing people get mad like that is so amusing.
110|Well you shouldn't be doing that to amuse yourself. How crude can you get?
110|You want me to hit you again?
110|Be careful; I hit back.
110|Don't threaten me with that blank expression.
110|Fortunately, I'm holding a ballpoint pen right now.
110|That's not fortunate at all.
110|In summary, this arc was amusing because you were a little ball of rage the entire time.
110|I am not amused. And it wasn't for the entire arc.
110|That's right. It did get a little unpleasant near the end when they were trying to give it an uplifting ending.
110|"Unpleasant," huh?
110|For those of you who haven't watched all of Sodachi Lost,
110|do yourself a favor and stop watching after the first half of Part Three.
110|Everyone's watched the whole thing already. Just what are you trying to suggest?
110|I'm just doing them a kindness,
110|because if they watch the second half of Part Three, they'll be left wondering, "What did the letter say?"
110|That may be so...
110|In truth, I was adamantly opposed to doing a commentary with the likes of you, Oikura,
110|but I came anyway because I wanted answers.
110|Oh, sorry. I forgot about the honorific.
110|Why don't you apologize for "the likes of" part first? Do you normally refer to me like that?
110|Huh? What? What's this?
110|Wasn't your first name "Dalikesuv?" Oikura Dalikesuv?
110|That's not an actual name!
110|Then what was your name again? It sounded like a mandarin orange, right?
110|T/N: A sudachi is a lime-like fruit, similar in size to a mandarin orange.
110|That's a "Sudachi." My name is Sodachi. Oikura Sodachi.
110|Really. Can I call you Soda-chee?
110|Seriously?
110|Then shall I call you "Euler?"
110|Psyche. I'm such a kidder.
110|Oh. I guess you didn't find it funny.
110|Of course not. Just know this: your deplorable actions have corrupted this commentary.
110|I'll have all of you know—
110|Oh my. Am I being scolded as a collective representation of the commentary?
110|Then I'll have you know—
110|You have to wait for me to scold you before you can make your rebuttal!
110|Trying to get everyone to call you Euler, the genius among geniuses, was really forced, in my opinion.
110|Maybe that's why everyone hated you.
110|I'd appreciate it if you didn't judge me during the commentary.
110|T/N: "Oira" is a male pronoun, often used by delinquent types in anime.
110|You should've just used "oira" as your pronoun and left it at that.
110|Doing that would've made me unpopular even faster.
110|So you admit to being unpopular? You couldn't stop people from giggling at you, after all.
110|Stop reveling in the schadenfreude. And people call you a heroine?
110|They say I'm the type who breaks the mold.
110|They'll find a way to make you fit eventually.
110|Like you?
110|Oh? Like me, you say?
110|Indeed, like me!
110|That's a scary smile.
110|So what kind of heroine are you?
110|That's something that worries me. People actually treat me like a heroine?
110|I absolutely loathe Araragi, you know.
110|That's true.
110|I simply hate him. I hate him without bias. There's only hate.
110|I suppose so.
110|I loathe, I detest, I abhor, I am sickened by, I scorn, I despise, I condemn, I hate.
110|That's too much hate. It's too strong of a phrase; use something more like Hanekawa.
110|"Can mew imyagine an imyaginayary mewnyagerie meynyager imyagining mewnyaging an imyaginyary mewnyagerie?"
110|Not that one. And it wasn't cute enough.
110|You remind me of a stray cat.
110|Don't call me a stray. If not that one, then which?
110|"I don't know everything. I just know what I know," obviously.
110|I messed up!
110|This is so embarrassing!
110|I want to die! I want to disappear!
110|And "Can mew imyagine an imyaginayary mewnyagerie meynyager imyagining mewnyaging an imyaginyary mewnyagerie"
110|isn't more embarrassing?
110|Why are you so good at Hanekawa's catchphrase?
110|I've probably said it more times than she has.
110|Then isn't it your catchprhase?
110|There are times I wonder if I'm actually her because I love her so much!
110|You're messed up.
110|Poor Hanekawa. She's got a dangerous fan now.
110|To that point, you've got nothing to worry about, because you have no fans.
110|Y—
110|Yeah, I don't. So what?
110|You are so bad at pretending to be unfazed.
110|I, on the other hand, am good at that, actually.
110|Yeah, you do seem like the type.
110|Try it. Say something horrible about me.
110|T/N: This is a pun between "dismiss" (更迭) and "steel" (鋼鉄), both of which are pronounced "koutetsu."
110|I'll show you why they call me "The Woman of Steel."
110|Maybe they'll get rid of you one of these days.
110|Gasp!
110|It didn't take much to upset you, did it?
110|How could you say something so cruel? Sob sob. I'm just a normal girl!
110|Don't use your femininity as a weapon.
110|I hate people like that second only to Araragi.
110|You poor thing. So you've never been treasured because of your femininity?
110|Still, Araragi stubbornly remains at the top, doesn't he?
110|What was your catchphrase again?
110|I clothe, I address, I adore, I am thickened by, I warn, I chastise, it's them, I bait.
110|Don't turn the anguished cries of my soul into some funny catchphrase!
110|Well it didn't turn out to be all that funny, to be honest.
110|Then at least try! Don't turn my catchphrase into a bad joke!
110|Then I'll let you take it from here.
110|I loathe, I detest, I abhor, I am sickened by, I scorn, I despise, I condemn, I hate.
110|Damn it. It sounds funny now that you prompted me to say it.
110|Your soul doesn't seem all that cloudy.
110|That's enough of you.
110|Stick with your own catchphrases!
110|You've got one, right?
110|I'll kill you.
110|That's your catchphrase?
110|It's all about the contrast between a cute girl like me and the terrifying words that are coming out of my mouth.
110|I don't see any contrast here.
110|Oh please. You're going for the same thing with those twintails of yours.
110|Stop referring to my twintails. And no, that's not what I'm going for.
110|The twintails are great for making scary girls extra scary.
110|My inner spirit quivers in terror as we speak.
110|"Inner spirit?" Do you even have a soul?
110|T/N: Wicked heart (邪心), pronounced "jyashin."
110|An evil one, yes. It's spelled "wicked heart."
110|T/N: Evil god (邪神), also pronounced "jyashin."
110|I think it's spelled "wicked god," you goddess of evil.
110|I'm beginning to wonder if you don't possess a frozen heart yourself,
110|like the Princess of Twintail.
110|T/N: Frozen reference.
110|You mean the Princess of Arendelle.
110|You got that reference?
110|What's the Kingdom of Twintail? What kind of people live there?
110|They all wear twintails, obviously.
110|Sounds tyrannical.
110|Not as tyrannical as your reign as Class 1-3's representative.
110|I wasn't nearly as tyrannical. In fact, I wasn't a tyrant at all.
110|I just wanted to be popular, that's all.
110|Is that what your soul cried out for?
110|I even thought that class trial was for the best...
110|All for the best!
110|There there. You just wanted everyone to think you were a proper girl, right?
110|I know how you feel, even if you failed miserably.
110|You suck at pep talks.
110|Well I'll tell you this now, but it turns out that you were actually quite unpopular even before the whole class trial thing.
110|Don't say that like it's some big reveal. I already suspected that was the case back then. Who has anything gain from that "reveal?"
110|The people listening to the commentary, of course. They're just chomping at the bit.
110|Stop making it sound like I was hated because I had it coming.
110|Is that another entry in your "screaming of my soul" series?
110|Don't make it a series!
110|T/N: Reference to the famous painting, The Scream.
110|If Edvard Munch were alive today, they say he would've drawn you!
110|Nobody says that! And he has not drawn me!
110|Well, despite your bad reputation, you did have some degree of authority up until the class trial started.
110|I suppose it means that politicians don't need popularity.
110|Meaning that politicians just need to understand politics.
110|If only I'd made the right preparations before starting the class trial...
110|You're pretty wicked yourself.
110|The problem is that you're screwed if they overthrow you and you're not popular,
110|because no one will come to your aid.
110|Don't say "no one," although nobody ended up helping me;
110|neither you nor Araragi.
110|Leaving me aside, do you seriously think that Araragi could've helped you out of that?
110|Didn't you vote him as the culprit?
110|But I did wonder for a moment as to whether or not I could help you.
110|Only for a moment, huh?
110|As they say, no one knows what the future holds.
110|Don't make my misfortune into a punchline.
110|In all seriousness, I had a very hectic time after you were overthrown,
110|because you had been looking after me, and with your exit,
110|I had to find someone else to leech off of.
110|Said like a true scumbag; scummier than me, in fact.
110|Quit looking for someone to leech off of.
110|T/N: She's referring to the fact that "yadorigi" (宿り木) can also refer to Mistletoe.
110|Being a parasite is just fine. Tee hee. How about a kiss?
110|You're definitely getting coal for Christmas.
110|Oh, looks like Part A ended while we were talking.
110|We didn't even hear about what was in the letter.
110|Do you honestly think I'd tell you, given your attitude?
110|We will now be starting Part B. Be silent.
110|Please refrain from speaking out of order.
110|Especially you, Senjougahara-san.
110|I'm the only one here, you know.
110|You don't look sorry at all.
110|Probably because I'm not.
110|How shameless. I can force you to stand.
110|T/N: "Tatsu" (立つ) can mean "stand" and "depart."
110|I'd like to stand. And leave.
110|Didn't I tell you that nobody was leaving until the commentary is over?
110|Seems like management's been able to quietly confine you.
110|I have not been confined!
110|Well, there may have been a time my so-called father did something like that.
110|There's no need for you to reveal your depressing past. I'm not Araragi-kun, so I don't know what to do with it.
110|I'll just let it pass with an "Oh really?"
110|Even if you can't deal with it, that was cold.
110|More importantly...
110|Was there something more important?
110|If we're talking about the past, let's reminisce about when we were first-years.
110|When I was hiding my real personality, and you were temporary dictator.
110|What are you talking about? Those sound like some hokey assumed identities.
110|And besides, there are no memories that the two of us can discuss.
110|I mean, I was the class representative, and I was painstakingly keeping an eye on you,
110|but it's not like we were that close.
110|Really? I recall us having a dispute over some comic dialogue that was sure to knock 'em dead.
110|What kind of dialogue?
110|Don't you remember? It could've been the closing act.
110|The joke: "I don't like Oikura when she's like this."
110|"No, she's already unlikable to begin with!" and the joke bombs hard.
110|That was definitely a dialogue you had with someone else!
110|You and somebody else were getting kicks out of talking crap about me!
110|Oh my.
110|You were ridiculing me!
110|T/N: "Oikora" sounds like "Oi, kora," i.e. "Hey, stop that."
110|No, it's a misunderstanding, Oikora-san.
110|Oh, crap. That was what we called you behind your back.
110|You were calling me "Oikora-san" behind my back?
110|Not only was it an insult, but I didn't even know about it! "How Much" wasn't my only nickname?
110|Well, I don't know if this is on the same track,
110|but you wanted to be called "Euler," so taking that into account,
110|there were people who called you "Fake Euler."
110|"Fake Euler?" They were merely twisting my request in order to mock me!
110|They stated that, "This Euler is false," like it was a mathematical proof.
110|Well aren't they a bunch of smartasses?
110|It's not like I'm defending them, but Mebe-san was good at math...
110|Mebe-san? I thought she was my friend!
110|So about that letter in Sodachi Lost...
110|Did you really think you'd be able to change the subject after revealing all the backbiting that was directed at me?
110|They called you "Fake Euler" because you're so domineering that you can't take a little ribbing from your friends.
110|How long are you going to drag the past around, Oikora-san?
110|You were the one dragging my formerly hidden nickname around.
110|But that nickname was between the girls. Among the guys—
110|I'd rather you didn't give me a detailed list of the abuses hurled at me from behind my back.
110|In discussing how petty you were, they took to calling you "Oikura Sodatanai."
110|T/N: "Sodatanai" (育たない) translates to "doesn't grow (up)."
110|That really pisses me off,
110|but realizing that you were in on it with the guys pisses me off too.
110|What, so I'm the bad guy here?
110|I think I hate you second only to Araragi.
110|I'm second to Araragi-kun after saying all that? His place at the top must be unshakable.
110|That's right. To me, he's like a retired number.
110|A retired number? Doesn't that kind of imply you admire him?
110|I hate your implication about half as much as I hate Araragi.
110|I'm not sure we can measure it in those units.
110|I'm not sure how they can rightfully conclude that we "fight a lot but we get along well," or that "I say I hate him but I love him;"
110|when we obviously fight so much that we deplore each other!
110|T/N: "Howling Surukara" = "I'm going to howl."
110|Quit yelling, Howling Surukara. How are you going to direct the commentary when you can't even use the mic properly?
110|And "I say I hate him but I love him?" Am I supposed to be a tsundere?
110|I'm going to go with "I will neither confirm nor deny that assertion."
110|Although, there was a time when I was like you;
110|hearing people say that we got along as well as we fought, or that I said I hated him but I loved him.
110|Understandably, since it was from a third-party's perspective, I didn't get along with people who said that.
110|Wouldn't you begin to hate people like that?
110|If you're going to imply that saying I hate him means the opposite, then if I say
110|I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him,
110|what do you think that means?
110|You hate him enough to say it 77 times?
110|They called me "Araragi-hater."
110|No, I'm pretty sure they called you "Oikura Sodatanai."
110|Don't use the nickname the boys had for me.
110|Oh? Then which would you prefer: "Oikora-san" or "Fake Euler?"
110|Can't we settle for "How Much?"
110|Moving on, there were some aspects of Sodachi Lost that I honestly didn't get.
110|Why on earth do you hate Araragi-kun so much?
110|You hate him more than Tetsujou-sensei or even the so-called father who confined you.
110|Or even you.
110|Despite all your talk, are you sure you're not actually in love with him?
110|Try putting some emotion into that next time.
110|Well, it's not like I wouldn't understand.
110|Between you and me, there was a time when I hated Araragi too.
110|"Between you and me?" That part's gone on sale, you know.
110|There was a time in first year when I was repulsed by the sight of him.
110|Really? I didn't expect that.
110|You always seemed like the type who didn't particularly care about anybody, myself included.
110|I was especially repulsed by you.
110|So you hated me, you mean.
110|I totally get why you hated him. After all, he aced the math test, right?
110|Don't commiserate with me about that. It makes me seem really petty.
110|You're Oikura Sodatanai, after all.
110|I DO grow.
110|Not only did I get taller while I was a shut-in, but I also grew as a person.
110|Yeah right.
110|I have!
110|Don't stand up. You're taller while sitting.
110|That's ridiculous! How tall do you think my chair is?
110|Just because you're the straight man doesn't mean you need to yell.
110|Do you not know how to hold a conversation?
110|I can't help it; I hardly talked to anybody for two years.
110|So basically, you've degenerated as a person.
110|What part of not talking to anybody would make me degenerate? If anything, I've evolved!
110|T/N: This is a pun between the dual meanings of "painful" and "to be (around)," both pronounced "itai."
110|Oh man, now you're just a pain.
110|Don't say that. I am NOT a pain.
110|You're painful to be around.
110|Well don't talk to me like that when you're around me.
110|Anyway, nobody cares about you, so let's go back to the main topic.
110|Was that first part necessary?
110|I was wary of Araragi ever since first year, and even now that we're dating, my perceptions have been slow to change.
110|There are still some aspects of him I don't like.
110|I know, right?
110|Like I said, you don't have to yell.
110|What kinds of things?
110|What aspects of him do you hate?
110|As for what I hate about him,
110|it's everything!
110|Everything, huh?
110|Everything. Everything! Eeeeeeverything!
110|I hate it all!
110|Don't break out in laughter like that. You've gone from painful to pitiful.
110|Try to remember those communication skills.
110|Sorry, I lost my composure.
110|T/N: Said like Hachikuji's catchphrase.
110|I'm fine. Now that Sodachi Lost is over, my soul is at peace.
110|Yet somehow, my soul feels uncomfortable.
110|So? What parts of him do you hate?
110|Give me a list of twenty things you hate about him.
110|T/N: A popular NHK radio quiz show that aired in the mid-20th century.
110|What is this, Twenty Doors?
110|The joke: "I hate Araragi when he's like this." "No, he's already unlikable to begin with!"
110|And the joke is passed down.
110|I don't like seeing the victim become the aggressor.
110|The original aggressor should shut up.
110|Well, maybe I'll start my hate list with this:
110|I'll let you touch my breasts.
110|This part. The part where he decides to follow Hanekawa-san.
110|Hmm...
110|Huh? What? Aren't you going to agree with me?
110|Well, I mean, I think anybody would follow Hanekawa-san in this situation,
110|rather than that creepy girl.
110|You lack conviction. Why are you trying to understand his viewpoint?
110|To be fair, if Hanekawa-san offered to let me touch her boobs, I'd follow her anywhere without question.
110|I don't think that's a good thing.
110|In any case, it's a gray area for me, because I don't really trust Hanekawa-san.
110|You don't trust her? What kind of sad events in your past have made you that cynical?
110|Are you implying that I haven't had a sad past?
110|Besides, weren't you somewhat similar in the past?
110|Yeah, that's true. In contrast, I was quite wary,
110|even more so than Araragi-kun.
110|Oh, wait a minute, let's get this straight:
110|you may have been that way, but I distrust Araragi more than Hanekawa-san, and I hate him more than I hate her.
110|Don't "wait a minute" me. Stop acting cute while insisting that you hate him.
110|I eat bell peppers while imagining that they're him.
110|T/N: Another reference to "Sodatanai."
110|You hate bell peppers? That's why you aren't growing.
110|Stop spreading that malicious nickname. My real name is Sodachi.
110|I'm actually holding back. I haven't told you the real bad ones.
110|There were more? Tell me what they were. Now. What did they call me?
110|Well I'll tell you since you asked...
110|I wouldn't ask if I didn't want to know.
110|They took the "soda" in Sodachi and turned it into "Caustic Soda."
110|I was bracing myself, but that was actually pretty good.
110|Incidentally, I was known as the "Cloistered Maiden."
110|You sound so indifferent about it that I'm not even envious.
110|Perhaps that's for the best.
110|I may not be envious, but I am jealous.
110|How's it compare to Araragi-kun?
110|Second only to him. Let's not make bringing up things that disgust me a custom, shall we?
110|I wonder if the contents of that letter were the same way.
110|Make people think that there was something heartwarming inside,
110|when it actually said, "I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate," right?
110|Stop simplifying my catchphrase.
110|Then correct me.
110|I won't. You'll only screw it up.
110|I loathe, I detest, I abhor, I am sickened by, I scorn, I despise, I condemn, I hate.
110|Are you sure? Absolutely positive? Could you swear on your life that it's 100% correct?
110|I'm not falling for that.
110|Do you know what might happen if you make a crazy person like me uneasy?
110|That's quite a threat.
110|The first episode may be ending, but just remember that we've got plenty of time, because we're doing three of them.
110|You're still not leaving this booth.
110|If you were solely judging from our conversation so far, I might seem like the villain,
110|but from an objective viewpoint, I'm the one in trouble here.
110|Well then, let's wrap up episode one.
110|Like I said, you aren't able to manage anything, be it a class trial or a commentary.
110|What are you talking about?
110|Since the arc's named after me, I'm the main heroine, and I get to take charge!
110|What kind of status are you trying to achieve?
110|Besides, wrap-up or not, we couldn't comment at all on the contents of this episode, because we got sidetracked talking about how everyone hates you.
110|You're the one who kept talking about how everyone hates me.
110|The Hated One debuts in episode two, so there was no other way.
110|It's not a nickname anymore. It's like I'm the representative of all that is hated now.
110|Isn't it nice to be able to represent something?
110|Although the Land of the Hated seems ready to launch a coup d'etat at any time now.
110|Part B is now over!
110|Quiet down, geez.
110|This is the ending.
110|You're too quiet. We'll need a body microphone to hear you.
110|I thought that would've gone better.
110|What, the commentary?
110|Don't get depressed. You're ruining the mood.
110|I'm so embarrassed!
110|I want to die! I want to disappear!
110|Come on, you're trying too hard to cover all the bases. This doesn't need to be perfect.
110|I don't care what you think! I need to be perfect like a math formula!
110|I'm pretty sure you can't be a formula.
110|I'm not sure if you suck at consoling people or if you're just good at hurting people.
110|In fact, I really can't see a personality like yours being well-suited for mathematics.
110|It's not a question of suitability. Math is the only thing that will never betray me.
110|But couldn't you interpret being voted out of your class as being betrayed by math?
110|Stop making your retorts sound logical!
110|Out of the following items, please list the one that will be ostracized:
110|Ostracized? It's not a math problem, it's a social studies problem!
110|1. How Much 2. Oikora-san 3. Fake Euler 4. Oikura Sodatanai 5. Caustic Soda
110|So, which one is the answer?
110|They're all me, and they're all being ostracized!
110|Oh, you didn't fall for the trick question. Impressive.
110|Make "Euler" one of the choices.
110|It's not a trick question; it's just a question made to ridicule me.
110|It's actually impressive how you've remained hated for so long.
110|I think you've contributed greatly to that. I think my poor reputation has been tarnished even more by this commentary.
110|Well, Oikura-san, I guess you'll have to tell me what's in that letter in episode two.
110|Is that all you care about?
110|The ending is over.
111|Back then, even the few friends I had were unaware of my parents' occupation,
111|so how did Oikura know?
111|Or so Hanekawa asked me yesterday before school.
111|Question
111|I could not answer.
111|I didn't know.
111|If you can't remember, why don't you ask your parents?
111|Question
111|This, ultimately, led to the answer.
111|Oikura and I had met in grade school.
111|We are childhood friends.
111|To be precise, it was when I was in sixth grade.
111|It was roughly around the time I played with Sengoku and my sister Tsukihi.
111|Oikura was there at home with me.
111|I don't really remember much from grade school,
111|but I remember the time I played with Tsukihi back then.
111|Well, I called her Rara.
111|Of course I remember you too, Koyomi.
111|So she said.
111|One day—
111|Well, I say all this as though I remember it now,
111|but in reality, I don't.
111|I don't really remember it at all.
111|I'm merely relaying what my parents have told me.
111|Anyway, one day,
111|my parents brought home a little girl with them.
111|That girl is, of course, Oikura Sodachi.
111|My parents didn't really explain,
111|and merely asked my sisters and me to get along with her since she would be staying with us for a little while.
111|My parents brought the young Oikura home to shield her from her family.
111|Her family, which at the time must have begun to descend into violence.
111|There was a strange girl there.
111|She didn't want to play with us,
111|but she didn't leave the room either.
111|She didn't talk.
111|One day, she was gone.
111|The young Oikura had decided she wanted to go home to her family.
111|Nobody forced her.
111|Her parents didn't come to collect her, nor did my parents run into trouble letting her stay at our home.
111|The young Oikura decided she had to leave our version of a family and go back to her own.

111|What lies ahead when everything's lost?
111|I should've let it all go ages ago,
111|but I kept pushing my expectations onto you.
111|I kept diving into the sea of possibilities in search of the slimmest of chances.
111|But it seems you'll never realize
111|what exactly it is that I'm made of.
111|I leave myself in your hands, smiling innocently
111|for this unknown future is just beginning.

111|Thank goodness.
111|I look well?
111|You really think so?
111|She puts on quite the act, doesn't she?
111|I mean, I always suspected she was more than a sickly, quiet girl, but...
111|Perhaps I should have her tried for assault.
111|I could go to a doctor while the swelling is still there and get a medical certificate.
111|There's no way the school would write her a recommendation after that.

111|Do you think we're close enough for jokes like that?
111|Do you want to get tried too?
111|I think going to a doctor with your cheek would be fruitless,

111|You're asking me this as the class rep, I assume?
111|Um...
111|Hanekawa, was it?
111|Yes.

111|I believe we are on exceptionally bad terms.
111|Am I under some misconception?
111|You're not.
111|But it wasn't always like this.
111|Isn't that what you tried to tell me yesterday?
111|I remember grade school too.
111|Oh, I was prepared, thinking, hey, it would be pretty dangerous if she threw the black tea at us.
111|I couldn't stop Senjougahara the day before yesterday, so I reflected on my mistake.

111|and not Hanekawa.
111|I hate you.
111|You remembered...
111|Not just remember, but after five years you finally understand what I was trying to do, it seems.
111|You must be here to make fun of me
111|for having tried so hard to seduce you
111|into helping me.
111|Seduce you?
111|S-So low.
111|I've sunk so low, so low, so low.
111|I've sunk so low!
111|I'm so ashamed that I had to seduce someone like you into helping me.
111|I threw away all my pride to flatter you.
111|I was licking your boots!
111|Emotionally!
111|I made a much bigger mistake trying to correct a different one.
111|I'm so ashamed!
111|I want to die!
111|I want to disappear!
111|Y'know, Araragi.
111|I don't think I'm the problem here.
111|I don't think I'm particularly unfortunate.
111|This kind of thing is not uncommon.
111|Hey, don't you agree?
111|You're not pitying me, are you?
111|Don't commiserate me.
111|I might want to die for real if you commiserate me.
111|End Story 1 Sodachi Lost Part Two
111|Black
111|I'll accept everything you have to say.
111|I haven't done anything to repay you yet.
111|If you don't want me to commiserate you, I won't.
111|If you don't want me to atone, I won't.
111|Huh?
111|Are you trying to flaunt?
111|Is this your idea of gallantry?
111|Your idea of the moral high ground?
111|You wasted
111|your chance at gallantry.
111|Yes, perhaps.
111|And you wasted your chance too.
111|Yes, I did.
111|What was I to do?
111|That I wasted my chance, that I ran away when I couldn't take it anymore, is my parents' fault.
111|They're the bad guys.
111|It's my parents' fault that I'm reduced to this.
111|What are your parents doing now?
111|Oh, my!
111|What, you care about my family?
111|You care about my crumbling ruin of a family?
111|You definitely didn't care in middle school!
111|Thankfully, my parents divorced after you elected to not help me.
111|My mother took custody of me and we left this town.
111|I don't give a shit what my father is up to right now.
111|Yeah.
111|He was the one.
111|That piece of shit.
111|My mother only hit me sometimes.
111|Whenever she was tired of taking hits from my father.
111|I spent two years hardly leaving this apartment,
111|and my mother never left our home either.
111|It was right after we moved.
111|The divorce was taking its toll on her.
111|She locked herself up in a room in our new home and didn't leave it.
111|She didn't leave it?
111|It was really difficult.
111|There she was in a locked room, huddling in a corner.
111|She completely stopped eating after a while.
111|She boarded up the window and kept the curtains closed.
111|Her room was total darkness.
111|I could hear her mumbling away.
111|Endless mumbling about how parents can't choose their kids.
111|Eventually she ignored me completely.
111|Thankfully, Japan is relatively wealthy.
111|Hand all the necessary paperwork in, and a mother and her child can just about survive.
111|I never once hoped my mother would disappear.
111|I can promise you that.

111|But my mother disappeared.
111|Against my wishes.
111|One day, without saying anything, without leaving me a message,
111|she was gone.
111|When I came home from school, she wasn't there.
111|She was gone.
111|She disappeared without warning just like I did, huh?
111|They say a daughter often takes after her father,
111|but I suppose I'm taking after my mother.
111|I made dinner and brought it to her room.
111|I unlocked the door. The room was completely empty.
111|No letter.
111|I don't know
111|Oikura
111|said so.
111|where either
111|of my parents are right now.
111|Either way, I was relieved of taking care of my mother.
111|I caught up with my studies.
111|I found someone among my relatives who would put their name down for guardianship,
111|and went back to this town to get welfare.
111|Oikura
111|I really didn't want to see you ever again,
111|but this was the only town with available housing.
111|Why did you want to live alone?
111|You could have stayed at the place you shared with your mother.
111|Why did you move?
111|Because it was a filthy hellhole.
111|Rather than clean up our mess, I wanted to leave it all behind.
111|I'm using very little furniture here now.
111|Isn't this place nice and clean?
111|Do you understand now?
111|I'm not that unfortunate.
111|What happened to me could have happened to anyone.
111|Everyone has these experiences to one degree or another.
111|It's not that uncommon...
111|It's not a tearjerker.
111|I guess it was a little harder than the average life, but that's just looking for excuses.
111|In the end, the only thing truly rare about it is that my mother became a shut-in,
111|but I can look at that as a rare and valuable experience.
111|I have to accept my experiences because many others have it just as hard.
111|I can count myself relatively lucky
111|because at least I'm still alive.
111|You don't have to pity me.
111|You don't have to apologize or atone, Araragi.
111|There's no need for amends.
111|Speaking to you takes a load off my mind.
111|It's all water under the bridge, anyway.
111|You want to talk about the past, but it's all in the past.
111|That story has ended.

111|Could you please go home?

111|Oikura,
111|you said you unlocked the door, right?
111|Wh—
111|Uh...
111|Yes.
111|You said you unlocked the door and your mother was gone.
111|But you also said she boarded up the window, right?
111|If the door was locked,
111|how did your mother leave the room?
111|Locked Room
111|How?
111|Through the door, I would assume.
111|She could just turn the knob to unlock it from the inside.
111|Then she left.
111|Did the door have smart lock, then?
111|No, it was a normal one with a key.
111|But
111|I left the key somewhere next to the door.
111|She probably just locked it again and left.
111|Huh...
111|Well,
111|I suppose.
111|Okay, Oikura.
111|Was the front door locked?
111|Huh? Who cares about that?
111|I don't really remember.
111|If you don't remember, it must have been unremarkable,
111|so we should assume it was locked.
111|You would have noticed if it had been unlocked.

111|Do you understand how I felt when I stayed with your family?
111|I was completely dumb-founded.
111|I thought my own family was normal.
111|Yours had no broken windows,
111|no cracks in the wall,
111|no chips in the floor.
111|I couldn't believe your home was neat, tidy, and peaceful.
111|That's why I just stared at you.
111|Without words, I stared at you.
111|Do you remember?
111|Yes.
111|A lie.
111|I have no memory of that time.
111|It was so radiant.
111|That's why I ran away.

111|I wish I'd never known.
111|ripped my body apart.
111|I wish
111|But it didn't work.
111|It was too late.
111|I'd never met you.
111|I'd already realized that my own family was wretched.
111|It was a relatively normal family.
111|To her, it was radiant.
111|It was too late for me then.
111|I tried to find odd ways to change my family
111|and for being rebellious they beat me even more

111|where people couldn't see it.
111|But, having run back to them, I couldn't run away.
111|Not anymore.
111|When I met you again in middle school, I thought it was a stroke of benevolent fate.
111|Didn't I try really hard to seduce you?

111|I've got psychological problems and I know it,
111|but what have I done to deserve this punishment?
111|Tell me, Araragi.
111|You're happy, right?
111|If you think I made the slightest contribution to your happiness, please tell me.
111|Why can't I be happy?
111|You can't be happy because you're not trying to be happy.
111|Nobody can make someone happy who doesn't try to be happy.
111|You talk like you know everything.
111|I don't know everything.
111|I just know what I know.
111|You're absolutely right.
111|Correct answer.
111|Answer
111|I mean, look at me.
111|I'm so brittle happiness would smash me.
111|My eyes blinded, my body ripped apart.
111|Happiness is too heavy for me.
111|I just want to survive the days, steeped in mild unhappiness.
111|I want it to drive me forward.
111|That's what I've done so far.
111|I don't want to be happy anymore.
111|It's too late for that.
111|Too late
111|Then when wouldn't it have been too late?
111|Was it already too late
111|long before then—
111|For my childhood friend.
111|Is everything too late,
111|in the past,
111|For my childhood friend.
111|unable to be undone,
111|changed
111|or remedied?
111|No.
111|It isn't.
111|We can do it.
111|It's not too late.

111|There's no happiness heavy enough to rip you apart.
111|Happiness is neither radiant nor heavy.
111|You overestimate happiness.
111|There are a million ways for you to be happy.
111|Don't hate happiness.
111|Don't hate the world.
111|Don't hate everything.
111|Don't hate yourself.
111|I'd gladly take all the hate you have in you.
111|I can be the one you hate.
111|Love yourself.
111|You can hate me as much as you like.
111|Love yourself at least as much
111|as I used to love you.
111|It's true. I'm very happy right now.
111|So I'll say this.
111|What I have is pretty normal!
111|Well said.
111|The town hall.
111|Soon the people from the town hall will come.
111|Sorry to interrupt you at such a lively point, but could you please go home?
111|They want to check how I'm doing.
111|They're gracious enough to overlook my absence from school,
111|but I don't want them to see me arguing with you.
111|Okay.
111|We will go home, then.
111|We'll be back tomorrow.
111|The day after, too, and also on the weekend.
111|Maybe you think we're pestering you, but pestering the people we like is what we do.
111|Oh, I forgot to say this.
111|I should've said this earlier.
111|You know, I really like you.
111|Okay.

111|I'll also apologize to Senjougahara.
111|I hear your laughter near me
111|You were supposed to be there forever
111|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
111|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
111|I heard your voice from the hallway
111|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
111|At some point I became unable
111|to talk to you normally
111|I can hear your laughter a ways away
111|You were supposed to be next to me forever
111|You knew how I felt
111|even when I said nothing
111|Now I know how important you were to me,
111|but we will never see each other again
112|Back then, even the few friends I had were unaware of my parents' occupation,
112|so how did Oikura know?
112|Or so Hanekawa asked me yesterday before school.
112|Question
112|I could not answer.
112|I didn't know.
112|Question
112|If you can't remember, why don't you ask your parents?
112|This, ultimately, led to the answer.
112|I met Oikura in grade school.
112|We were childhood friends.
112|To be precise, it was when I was in sixth grade.
112|It was roughly around the time I played with Sengoku and my sister Tsukihi.
112|I was with Oikura Sodachi at my home.
112|I don't really remember much from grade school,
112|but I remember the time I played with Tsukihi-chan back then.
112|Well, I called her Rara.
112|Of course I remember you, too, Koyomi-oniichan.
112|So she said.
112|One day—
112|Well, I say all this as though I remember it now,
112|but in reality, I don't.
112|I don't remember at all.
112|I'm merely relaying what my parents have told me.
112|Anyway, one day,
112|my parents brought home a little girl with them.
112|That girl is, of course, Oikura Sodachi.
112|My parents didn't really explain
112|and merely asked me and my sisters to get along with her since she would be staying with us for a little while.
112|My parents brought the young Oikura home to shield her from her family.
112|Her family, which at the time must have begun to descend into violence.
112|There was a strange girl there.
112|She didn't want to play with us,
112|but she didn't leave the room, either.
112|She didn't talk.
112|One day, she was gone.
112|The young Oikura had decided she wanted to go home to her family.
112|Nobody forced her.
112|Her parents didn't come to collect her, nor did my parents run into trouble letting her stay at our home.
112|The young Oikura decided she had to leave our version of a family and go back to her own.

112|I mean, I always suspected she was more than a sickly, quiet girl, but...
112|Perhaps I should have her tried for assault.
112|I could go to a doctor while the swelling is still there and get a medical certificate.

112|You remembered...
112|Not just remembered, but after five years you finally understood what I was trying to do, it seems.
112|You must be here to make fun of me
112|for having tried so hard to seduce you
112|into helping me.
112|Seduce you?
112|S-So stupid.
112|So stupid, stupid, stupid!
112|I'm so stupid!
112|I'm so ashamed that I had to seduce someone like you into helping me.
112|I threw away all my pride to flatter you.
112|I was licking your boots!
112|Emotionally!
112|I made a much bigger mistake trying to correct a different one.
112|I'm so ashamed!
112|I want to die!
112|I want to disappear!
112|You know, Araragi.
112|I don't think I'm the problem here.
112|I don't think I'm particularly unfortunate.
112|This kind of thing is not uncommon.
112|Hey, don't you agree?
112|You're not pitying me, are you?
112|Don't commiserate me.
112|I might want to die for real if you commiserate me.

112|I'll accept everything you have to say.

112|Are you trying to flaunt?
112|Is this your idea of gallantry?
112|Your idea of the moral high ground?
112|You wasted
112|your chance at gallantry.
112|Yes, perhaps.
112|And you wasted your chance, too.
112|Yes, I did.
112|What was I to do?
112|That I wasted my chance, that I ran away when I couldn't take it anymore, is my parents' fault.
112|They're the bad guys.
112|It's my parents' fault that I'm reduced to this.
112|What are your parents doing now?
112|Oh, my!
112|What, you care about my family?
112|You care about my crumbling ruin of a family?
112|You definitely didn't care in middle school!
112|Thankfully, my parents divorced after you elected to not help me.
112|My mother took custody of me and we left this town.
112|I couldn't care less what my father is up to right now.
112|Yeah.
112|He was the one.
112|That piece of crap.
112|My mother only hit me sometimes.
112|Whenever she was tired of taking hits from my father.
112|I spent two years hardly leaving this apartment,
112|and my mother never left our home, either.
112|It was right after we moved.
112|The divorce was taking its toll on her.
112|She locked herself up in a room in our new home and didn't leave it.
112|She didn't leave it?
112|It was really difficult.
112|There she was in a locked room, huddling in a corner.
112|She completely stopped eating after a while.
112|She boarded up the window and kept the curtains closed.
112|Her room was in total darkness.
112|I could hear her mumbling away.
112|Endless mumbling about how parents can't choose their kids.
112|Eventually, she completely ignored me.
112|Thankfully, Japan is relatively wealthy.
112|Hand all the necessary paperwork in, and a mother and her child can just about survive.
112|I never once hoped my mother would disappear.
112|I can promise you that.

112|Against my wishes.
112|One day, without saying anything, without leaving me a message,
112|she was gone.
112|When I came home from school, she wasn't there.
112|She was gone.
112|She disappeared without warning just like I did, huh?
112|They say a daughter often takes after her father,
112|but I suppose I'm taking after my mother.
112|I made dinner and brought it to her room.
112|I unlocked the door. The room was completely empty.
112|No letter.
112|I don't know
112|Oikura
112|said so.
112|where either
112|of my parents are right now.
112|Either way, I was relieved of taking care of my mother.
112|I caught up with my studies.
112|I found someone among my relatives who would put their name down for guardianship
112|and came back to this town to get welfare.
112|Oikura
112|I really didn't want to see you ever again,
112|but this was the only town with available housing.
112|Why did you want to live alone?
112|You could have stayed at the place you shared with your mother.
112|Why did you move?
112|Because it was a filthy nightmare.
112|Rather than clean up our mess, I wanted to leave it all behind.
112|I'm using very little furniture here now.
112|Isn't this place nice and clean?
112|Do you understand, now?
112|I'm not that unfortunate.
112|What happened to me could have happened to anyone.
112|Everyone has these experiences to one degree or another.
112|It's not that uncommon...
112|It's not a tearjerker.
112|I guess it was a little harder than the average life, but that's just looking for excuses.
112|In the end, the only thing truly rare about it is that my mother became a shut-in,
112|but I can look at that as a rare and valuable experience.
112|I have to accept my experiences because many others have it just as hard.
112|I can count myself relatively lucky
112|because at least I'm still alive.
112|You don't have to pity me.
112|You don't have to apologize or atone, Araragi.
112|There's no need for amends.
112|Speaking to you takes a load off my mind.
112|It's all in the past, anyway.
112|You want to talk about the past, but it's all in the past.
112|It's already the end of that story.

112|you said you unlocked the door, right?
112|Wh—
112|Uh...
112|Yes.
112|You said you unlocked the door and your mother was gone.
112|But you also said she boarded up the window, right?
112|If the door was locked,
112|how did your mother leave the room?
112|[Locked Room]
112|How?
112|Through the door, I would assume.
112|She could just turn the knob to unlock it from the inside.
112|Then she left.
112|Did the door have smart lock, then?
112|No, it was a normal one with a key.
112|But
112|I left the key somewhere next to the door.
112|My mother probably just locked it again and left.
112|Huh...
112|Well,
112|I suppose.
112|Okay, Oikura.
112|Was the front door locked?
112|Huh? Who cares about that?
112|I don't really remember.
112|If you don't remember, it must have been unremarkable,
112|so we should assume it was locked.

112|Yours had no broken windows,
112|no cracks in the wall,
112|no chips in the floor.
112|I couldn't believe your home was neat, tidy, and peaceful.
112|That's why I just stared at you.
112|Without words, I stared at you.
112|Do you remember?
112|Yes.
112|A lie.
112|I have no memory of that time.
112|It was so radiant.
112|That's why I ran away.
112|The radiance dazzled me, blinded me.
112|The warmth and love
112|I wish I'd never known.
112|ripped my body apart.
112|I wish
112|But it didn't work.
112|It was too late.
112|I'd never met you.
112|I'd already realized that my own family was wretched.
112|It was a relatively normal family.
112|To her, it was radiant.
112|It was too late for me then.
112|I tried to find odd ways to change my family,
112|and for being rebellious, they beat me even more,
112|but only where my clothes would hide it.
112|Over and over
112|where people couldn't see it.
112|But, having run back to them, I couldn't run away.
112|Not anymore.
112|When I met you again in middle school, I thought it was a stroke of benevolent fate.
112|Didn't I try really hard to seduce you?
112|Well, the rebound came when I met you again in high school.
112|It was all the more difficult.

112|and fate is cruel.
112|You appear at the turning points in my life and sow the seeds of calamity.
112|Is it my fault?
112|Yes.
112|It's your fault my life is a mess.
112|No.
112|I know it's not.
112|It's not your fault; it's mine.

112|You're happy, right?
112|If you think I made the slightest contribution to your happiness, please tell me.
112|Why can't I be happy?
112|You can't be happy because you're not trying to be happy.

112|Don't hate happiness.

112|It's true. I'm very happy right now.
112|So I'll say this.
112|What I have is pretty normal!
112|Well said.
112|The town hall.
112|Soon the people from the town hall will come.
112|Sorry to interrupt you at such a lively point, but could you please go home?
112|They want to check how I'm doing.
112|They're gracious enough to overlook my absence from school,
112|but I don't want them to see me arguing with you.
112|Okay.
112|We will go home, then.
112|We'll be back tomorrow.
112|The day after, too, and also on the weekend.
112|Maybe you think we're pestering you, but pestering the people we like is what we do.
112|Oh, I forgot to say this.
112|I should've said this earlier.
112|You know, I really like you.
112|Owarimonogatari Episode Six, Sodachi Lost, Part Two
112|Black Scene
112|Okay.
112|Please find my mother, then.
112|I'll come to school if you find her.
112|I'll also apologize to Senjougahara-san.
112|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
112|I hear your laughter beyond the door
112|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
112|You were supposed to be with me forever
112|kyoushitsu no mado ni iki o haite kaita
112|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
112|namae o awatete sode de keshita
112|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
112|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara
112|I heard your voice from the hallway
112|kokoro gomakasu you ni hayaashi de kaetta
112|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
112|itsukaraka watashi wa kimi to
112|At some point I became unable
112|hanasenaku natta
112|to talk to you normally
112|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
112|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
112|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
112|You were supposed to be next to me forever

112|You knew how I felt

113|Return to ED
113|End
113|Order.
113|We will now be commencing the commentary for Owarimonogatari: Sodachi Lost, Part Two.
113|"Commencing?" Is this a trial or something?
113|Then I suppose you're the defendant.
113|Well that class meeting was like a trial...
113|That class trial was certainly a fitting location for you.
113|Oh, y-you think so?
113|You can't even handle a compliment like that?
113|I just meant that the wig looked good on you.
113|I was not wearing a judge's wig!
113|I will hold you in contempt of court!
113|Still, to think that Araragi-kun's parents were police officers.
113|When did I find out?
113|He tried keeping it hidden.
113|Really? Even though you're his girlfriend?
113|You were dating and he still kept secrets from you.
113|Reeeally?
113|Could you stop treating every little issue as a victory?
113|You aren't hated; you're just a terrible human being.
113|I never said I wasn't.
113|Don't get defiant. Fix your behavior instead.
113|Are you telling me to become like her?
113|Not a chance. In fact, I hate her.
113|You hate Sengoku-san too?
113|She hadn't even done anything at this point!
113|Although the problem may have been that nobody did anything about her.
113|But when I say I hate her, it's only about a tenth as much as I hate Araragi.
113|That's quite a bit less.
113|Well, I hate her too. I hate her so much. High five!
113|There's no way I'm high fiving you, especially over something like this!
113|Oh, that's right. You don't hate her because she's cute, you hate her because you met during your loli years,
113|when you lived with the Araragis.
113|Yes, I hated her since those days.
113|She had the nerve to get along with me.
113|You mean, "she got along with Araragi-kun," right?
113|Wrong. That would make it sound like I was in love with him and I got jealous.
113|Still, when you hate someone, they normally hate you back.
113|Sengoku-san may have had a gentle expression on her face, but she did recall that you seemed strange.
113|Seems like she was gently badmouthing you.
113|I hate that part of her too.
113|She was also a weirdo, as I recall.
113|What did you think of his sisters, Karen-san and Tsukihi-san?
113|Do you think I liked them?
113|I do.
113|"I admire, I like, I adore, I am enchanted by, I cherish, I treasure, I idolize, I love,"
113|is what you must've said.
113|Do you actually think I said that? Don't misappropriate my catchphrase.
113|You've had that catchphrase since your loli days?
113|First of all, stop saying "loli days."
113|You were already exuding darkness at this point.
113|What was your nickname then?
113|Where are you taking this conversation? You're concerned about the wrong thing.
113|The avant-title is over.
113|We will now commence the opening.
113|It's like you're saying, "Present the evidence."
113|Oikura Angel.
113|Huh? "Oikura Angel?"
113|Crap. That was a good nickname I was supposed to keep secret.
113|Golden Angel, Silver Angel, Oikura Angel.
113|I had good nicknames?
113|Damn it. I swore to never tell her.
113|To think I could commit such an unthinkable and lamentable error!
113|You're getting way too worked up over revealing that I had a good reputation.
113|"She's always crabby, but she really isn't a bad person, you know,"
113|is an anecdote I need to keep secret.
113|Someone understood me?
113|Learning that was way too late at this point, but still.
113|See? That's why I kept it a secret.
113|Wrong.
113|You kept it a secret because you didn't want me to have any happy memories.
113|But I thought you didn't like praise?
113|That's not true.
113|I was just freaked out by that last time because it was so sudden.
113|Obviously, I'd enjoy praise.
113|You're so cute, Oikura-san! Your hair is so pretty!
113|STOP IT!
113|And yet something comes bubbling back up.
113|Don't praise me!
113|Especially my appearance! Berate me!
113|Slander me. Slander me!
113|Slander you?
113|Slan-der me!
113|A "slander" cheer? That's the first I've ever heard of it.
113|I'm going to chop this hair off!
113|I think your symptoms are getting worse.
113|What kind of slander?
113|Slan-der me!
113|You say not to praise your appearance, but there's nothing on the inside to praise, either.
113|We will now summon witnesses for Part A.
113|Now you're definitely making this into a trial.
113|It's cute how you're in your pajamas right off the bat.
113|STOP IT!
113|Don't compliment my clothes or I'll take them off!
113|Now you're really starting to worry me.
113|Although it's cute how you got embarrassed over flubbing that line.
113|You're even blushing.
113|My cheek was red because you punched me, you bitch.
113|Oh my, language.
113|You definitely deserved that.
113|Well you may have gotten off with a swollen cheek, but I broke my hand, you know.
113|In that sense, you could even say that I'm the bigger victim here.
113|You'd really say that?
113|With a straight face, even.
113|But still, Oikuru-san... Oh no, I flubbed my line too.
113|*Tilt*
113|Stop tilting your head.
113|And don't "tilt" me!
113|Everyone's doing it now like it's in fashion,
113|but I was the first one in the Monogatari Series to do a crazy headtilt like that.
113|That's only because you appeared first.
113|Let's do Senjougahara-san's Crazy Headtilt Pose... like this.
113|I hope you fall over backwards, hit your head, and die.
113|Vindictive, are we? You didn't need to wish for my death.
113|I wouldn't mind if you died by hitting your head, but I also wouldn't mind shooting your head, either.
113|T/N: This is a pun between 打つ (utsu), to hit, and 撃つ (utsu), to shoot.
113|Let's leave the guns alone.
113|I haven't done anything to deserve being shot.
113|Probably.
113|Why did you hesitate there?
113|Still, you also do a crazy headtilt pose later on.
113|That was scary. It was even crazier than what Yotsugi-chan did.
113|"Yotsugi-chan?" Who's that?
113|You don't know her?
113|Even when she's been randomly inserted into Owarimonogatari a number of times?
113|She was tilting her head almost as much as you did when you asked, "Am I under some misconception?"
113|Though your face was scarier.
113|P-please. You don't need to say that my face was scarier.
113|That wasn't a compliment. Don't blush.
113|I haven't hit you, yet your cheeks are flushed.
113|"I haven't hit you, yet your cheeks are flushed," is a messed up thing to say, you psycho.
113|I don't particularly think of myself as a psycho.
113|Am I under some misconception?
113|Stop covering my song.
113|I was copying everything, down to the headtilt.
113|What happened to your catchphrase?
113|I'll kill you.
113|Not that one.
113|Don't you have any other "original songs?"
113|Senjougahara fascination.
113|Araragi-kun coined the phrase, but I inspired him.
113|Oikura-san fascination...
113|NOOOOOOOO!
113|You're way too sensitive about being praised.
113|Being hated is easier.
113|Please, call me "Caustic Soda!"
113|I'd like to claim that I don't know where you're coming from, but that wouldn't be entirely true.
113|I lived my life like that up until very recently.
113|Huh? Really?
113|What was it like? Tell me, tell me!
113|Don't get excited by that.
113|You're way too interested in tales about broken people.
113|Broken?
113|Were you also a broken person while I was taking a break from school?
113|How about that. You couldn't find anyone else to leech off of.
113|Well aren't you chipper?
113|While we're on the subject of broken people, I heard that Araragi was quite broken for a time.
113|Suck it!
113|Well in Araragi's case, it seems as though you were the direct cause.
113|Ah, but that brings back memories.
113|The first time Araragi-kun and I interacted, I got naked in front of him.
113|Just as you've stripped down to your PJs for him.
113|Quit equating pajamas with nudity.
113|Call it "pajamas" or "roomwear" if you want, but they seem awfully like undergarments to me.
113|To be fair, he got to see me in my undergarments too.
113|Are you sure you're not "Caustic Soda?"
113|Now that I think about it, I can't recall what possessed me to do that.
113|Perhaps Araragi-kun has some trait that makes women strip for him.
113|T/N: One of Aesop's Fables.
113|Yeah right. This isn't The North Wind and the Sun.
113|Futhermore, you make it sound as though I was the one who broke him,
113|but he was friendless even before the class trial.
113|I wasn't the only one who hated him.
113|True.
113|He had nicknames too, remember?
113|Did he? He wasn't the type to make himself the center of attention, unlike you.
113|I don't recall ever having the chance to nickname him.
113|I tried to be proactive and bring him up in conversation.
113|And it's because of you that people had misconceptions about him.
113|Mainly about how you were secretly in love with him.
113|Rumors like that were flying around back then?
113|That fact is more painful than any insult could hope to be.
113|Oh, right. Araragi-kun may not have had his own nickname,
113|but they did refer to the two of you like an idol unit as "Oikuraragi."
113|While I find the idea of being paired with him repulsive,
113|I see our class had a smartass who thought he was good with nicknames.
113|That's right. You resented them without even knowing about that.
113|You think you're being so witty, but it's not a question of whether or not I knew.
113|Your example wouldn't cause me to realize how foolish I was for not believing the person in question was skilled at nicknaming.
113|Even so, Oikuraragi-san...
113|I am NOT Oikuraragi-san.
113|Huh? What? Was the pairing disbanded?
113|Araragi and I were never a pair to begin with.
113|True.
113|But you and I were paired.
113|They combined Hitagi and Sodachi into "Oihara Sodaki."
113|That's lame. Plus it's hard to say.
113|You can't tell who it's referring to.
113|Don't call it lame. I was the one who came up with it, after all.
113|You did?
113|You shouldn't come up with a name for us until you've consulted me first!
113|I didn't want to bother you with the details.
113|You're bothering me by forcing me into predicaments, both in the story and in the commentary.
113|What's with the three of you?
113|Apparently Hanekawa-san's image has suffered because of Araragi-kun and me.
113|I feel a little bit responsible for this.
113|Perhaps it's not my place to say this,
113|but it seems to me like neither you and Hanekawa, nor Araragi and Hanekawa would have much in common.
113|What exactly do you three talk about?
113|Hmm. It's hard for me to say.
113|Araragi-kun and I are dating; Hanekawa-san and I are best friends.
113|Araragi-kun and Hanekawa-san are each others' saviors, and they would probably do anything for each other.
113|Be that as it may, we really don't have a whole lot in common when the three of us get together.
113|Really? Is that how it is?
113|Well, it's not like there's bad blood between us;
113|we just have to dance around some issues.
113|A lot has happened, after all.
113|A lot of what? What do you mean? I want to know!
113|You're way too good at picking out sources of trouble.
113|They say that three heads are better than one, but not in your case, eh?
113|That's right! Why don't we have a party? I'll organize it!
113|You've never been to a party, ever.
113|Please don't organize it.
113|Stop trying to display your "leadership" everywhere you go.
113|Let's do a gift exchange!
113|The kind where nobody knows where their gift is going!
113|That sounds really evil. It's enough to set my heart aflutter.
113|But in that case, your present might go to Araragi-kun, or his present might go to you.
113|NOOOOOOOOO!
113|Are you really that repulsed?
113|No...
113|No!
113|I don't want to, but...
113|But if it's all for the opportunity to see the awkwardness between the three of you...
113|If it's for the chance to see Araragi suffer...!
113|Your soul is screaming a little too loudly.
113|I want to see that.
113|I want to see it!
113|I want to see things get really awkward between you three!
113|Don't worry; you're going to provide us with all the buzzkill we need.
113|Oh please. Did you think your words would discourage me?
113|On the contrary, your words have no effect!
113|In fact, that's exactly what I want!
113|May my presence kill the mood without end!
113|I think your spite is the only thing that's limitless here.
113|In all seriousness, there may actually be situations in which
113|everyone gets along individually, only to have everything get awkward when everyone's together.
113|Right. That's why the commentaries are done in pairs.
113|T/N: ギスギス (gisu gisu), i.e. "strained", sounds like キスキス (kissu kissu), i.e. "kiss"
113|I can't really make out any positives in our relationship, though.
113|We're going to make out? Oh my, what are you talking about?
113|What the hell are you talking about?
113|I'm pretty sure we haven't ever done a three-person commentary.
113|At one point, we rotated a cast of characters around Hanekawa-san,
113|but those were still two-person commentaries.
113|A three-person commentary does sound interesting enough to try sometime.
113|With you, Hanekawa, and Araragi!
113|You sound way too happy about that.
113|Why don't you do one alongside Araragi-kun and Tetsujou-sensei?
113|What kind of hell are you trying to inflict on me?
113|It's like a courthouse where everyone is on trial.
113|Continuing that thought, I'd be very curious to see how things would work out if you and Hanekawa-san were commentating.
113|Hanekawa-san is so tolerant that Araragi-kun calls him his "second mother," so I wonder if she could've handled you?
113|Does that creep really call her his "second mother?"
113|That goes beyond hate and straight into gross territory.
113|Those two went through a lot.
113|What does that mean?
113|You really like stories about his troubles.
113|For your information, if you enjoy stories like that,
113|there's no end to them. I have an infinite number of them.
113|That was funny?
113|Although, I'm still unclear on the details about what happened between those two
113|during spring break and Golden Week.
113|What did you say? Get the details, then!
113|So that's what you get the angriest about?
113|You've gotta be kidding me.
113|You're unreliable at the most crucial times, you useless scumbag.
113|I think that statement makes you the scummy one.
113|To be fair, so am I.
113|You really can't win with these commentaries.
113|We've had all kinds of scumbags here.
113|The abundance of scumbags sounds like a problem.
113|A famous one would be Tsukihi-chan.
113|She's still a scumbag, huh?
113|She was like that back then too?
113|When I was stuck in the Araragi household, she told me this:
113|"Make yourself at home and relax. Think of us as your family."
113|Sounds like a nice girl.
113|"But you came here after I did, so I want you to call me Tsukihi-oneechan, even if you're older. You're a terrible person if you don't."
113|What a scumbag.
113|But she wasn't even a fourth-grader then, so it makes sense.
113|Well it's nice to have a commentary like this.
113|High five!
113|That's why we aren't kindred spirits, and we can't get along with each other.
113|But wouldn't it be better to say what's on your mind like first graders would, rather than have everything be superficial?
113|I'm not sure about that.
113|You make it sound like superficial relationships are a bad thing,
113|but I think they're a fundamental part of smooth communication.
113|If everyone went around saying exactly what they thought, society couldn't function.
113|Coming from someone who couldn't function in society, your words carry a lot of weight.
113|People like to put things diplomatically.
113|True.
113|If you'd been more diplomatic,
113|you might have avoided getting a pink slip.
113|I did not get a pink slip.
113|I might have been absent from school after the class trial,
113|but I never gave up my seat as Class Representative.
113|Then show some grace and resign already.
113|Why do you insist on pretending you have status?
113|Though I may have erred, I refuse to give up my power!
113|If my refusal to hand over my seat caused
113|some procedural headaches for the ones who caused me to suffer, then so be it!
113|See, I find it hard to empathize with you when you act like that.
113|You aren't pitying me, are you?
113|Don't commiserate me.
113|I wouldn't commiserate you, even if you asked.
113|But please allow me to pity you.
113|Part A is now adjourned.
113|Try suppressing your attitude, please.
113|Order in the court.
113|We will now declare the verdict for Part B.
113|No judge would read out a verdict with that much enthusiasm.
113|If you want me to quiet down, then how about you get serious for once?
113|T/N: In Japanese trials, the verdict is typically declared prior to the explanation of how the verdict was reached. In particularly serious crimes (like murder), the rationale is read out prior to the declaration of the verdict/sentence.
113|The court will first explain the rationale behind its verdict.
113|Stop saying it like you're passing a death sentence.
113|So now they're setting up a mystery, huh?
113|I realize that everything that follows this stems from my request,
113|but why was Hanekawa-san so fixated on this?
113|I get what you're trying to say.
113|After telling her your story, you thought, "Wait, this is the part she cares about?"
113|She was more worried about the locked room than your family's circumstances.
113|That's a bit weird, no matter how you think about it.
113|Maybe she's just too smart.
113|It's different from how a mathematician would think.
113|I thought there was a part in Nekomonogatari (White) where we fixed this aspect of her,
113|but it had just happened, so maybe some traces of it were left.
113|I wonder who's the most dangerous among Araragi-kun, Hanekawa-san, and you?
113|You left out the most important suspect.
113|My, Oikura-san. You think I'm the most important?
113|You left out the "suspect" part.
113|Come now; Hanekawa-san is trying her best, so find it in your heart to forgive her.
113|Not Hanekawa-san. You're the one who should be asking for forgiveness, given what you're charged with.
113|You're trying hard too, so I forgive you.
113|Don't go crazy over my forgiveness.
113|I'm going crazy because of your forgiveness!
113|What right do you have to forgive me?
113|But at the end of Part B, you promised Araragi-kun and Hanekawa-san
113|that you would apologize to me, right?
113|I did promise, yes.
113|I know, right?
113|So apologize.
113|Forget forgiveness; I'm seriously worried about you now.
113|Do you really think you're fine the way you are?
113|Are you doing well in class?
113|Do you have any friends other than Araragi and Hanekawa-san?
113|Please don't actually worry about me.
113|Besides, I already apologized for hitting you.
113|Apologizing in private isn't enough.
113|A real apology would be performed in front of everyone.
113|I'll organize the press conference.
113|It wasn't important enough to hold a press conference.
113|Wait a minute; you used very kind words when you accepted my apology earlier!
113|Stop! What are you trying to say?
113|Huh? I didn't think you could yell like that!
113|What's your real personality? You're too enigmatic!
113|An "enigma," you say? Your mother's disappearance was quite the mystery as well.
113|Araragi-kun chose to solve that mystery, didn't he?
113|I know he's the one who was asked to do it,
113|but in truth, neither Hanekawa-san nor I could have solved that. Only he could.
113|You might be right.
113|I hate that too, obviously.
113|Although it's hard to say whether that really was the right thing to do.
113|It's not like that's what was expected of him, and it isn't like Hanekawa-san was a coward for not attempting it.
113|I guess the consideration he had for you was hard to convey.
113|True.
113|But it's too late for that.
113|Just like the the nickname they whispered at you behind your back.
113|It's definitely too late for that.
113|It was too late to help my mom,
113|but it was also something that was long overdue.
113|I will absolutely never accept that Araragi was right, though.
113|I'll never accept it.
113|I'll never accept it!
113|I didn't say anything that time.
113|I said nothing, yet she went crazy all the same.
113|Oops. That's how I rebound from being sad.
113|That was one heck of a rebound. It's more like you're overcompensating, really.
113|Perhaps the blues I feel after bursting into laughter are also a rebound.
113|Maybe you need to learn some self-control.
113|But when you spent your "secret summer vacation" with Araragi-kun in middle school, nothing like that happened, right?
113|Don't call it that.
113|But wait, here's the thing:
113|I don't know how Araragi described it to you, but I think he embellished the details considerably.
113|Undoubtedly.
113|You claimed to have "seduced" him,
113|but I highly doubt that your acting skills were good enough to succeed.
113|I doubt I became hysterical,
113|but with that said, I was a 7th grader at the time.
113|Something similar to what Araragi imagined may have happened.
113|"Imagined," huh?
113|I think he truly believed that a "math fairy" actually existed.
113|Then my efforts happened to fit right into his delusions,
113|and the coincidence only strengthened his beliefs.
113|But going off of that, we'd have to assume that 7th grade you was not only good at math,
113|but good at teaching it as well, right?
113|Yes, that part is true.
113|Naturally, it took every fiber of my being to get him to learn.
113|Let's take a step back, ignore the strange goal you were directing your efforts towards,
113|and call that a talent of yours.
113|As I witnessed him learn more and more about math,
113|I trembled when I realized I had the power to lead people.
113|This mistakenly led me to believe that I was a born leader, and the class trial was the result.
113|So much for great responsibility coming with great power.
113|Seems like it disastrously backfired.
113|Am I correct in assuming that you and Hanekawa-san are tutoring Araragi?
113|In not just math, but all subjects.
113|When you put it like that, he's truly blessed as far as test-takers go.
113|I know, right?
113|Stop leaning towards me with that delighted expression.
113|He doesn't know what he's made of!
113|I'm certain that he makes up a good portion of you, though.
113|In fact, I'd say that he's a bigger part of you compared to me,
113|but that makes sense, seeing as you're childhood friends.
113|I get it; he's a big part of me, huh?
113|So that's why I hate myself so much!
113|Don't giggle like that. It scares the crap out of me.
113|Is this your happy medium?
113|I mean, I get it because I'm the same way,
113|but you cause your hatred of yourself and Araragi-kun to deepen because you say stuff like that.
113|Really? I think I'd hate them both regardless.
113|I loathe, I detest, I abhor, I am sickened by, I scorn, I despise, I condemn, I hate.
113|See, you keep spiraling deeper when you say stuff like that as your catchphrase.
113|When I still had my venomous tongue, it was like I was poisoning myself.
113|Though it seemed like I was hurting Araragi-kun, the person I was actually hurting was myself.
113|No, I'm pretty sure Araragi was taking the brunt of the pain.
113|You weren't being poisoned; you were the poison.
113|Repeat after me, even if you don't believe a word of it:
113|It's not my fault.
113|I love myself.
113|I love myself so much.
113|C'mon, believe in me!
113|Repeat after me! Trust me!
113|It's not my fault.
113|I love myself.
113|I love myself so much.
113|Marvelous. Maybe a little happier, but you get the idea.
113|Now, again! Repeat until you get sick of it, no, until you love it!
113|It's not my fault.
113|I love myself.
113|I love myself so much.
113|It's not my fault.
113|I love myself.
113|I love myself so much.
113|It's not my fault, I love myself, I love myself so much.
113|I love Araragi so much.
113|I love Araragi so—
113|HEY WAIT!
113|Oh, it's Oikora-san. How nostalgic.
113|It's been a while, Oikora-san.
113|It is not nostalgic!
113|That's something you called me a couple minutes ago!
113|Nostalgia? More like nonsense!
113|And what are you trying to make me say? Stop setting such cruel traps!
113|It's your fault for trusting me.
113|You are such a scumbag!
113|And I'll have you know that
113|I hate Araragi and myself even more now, thanks to you.
113|I could've sworn that kind of therapy worked.
113|Part B is over!
113|And now the ending.
113|Oh, it seems like you can contain your excitement now.
113|My rage towards you still remains.
113|How dare you trick me into saying that I love Araragi?
113|How dare you make me say something so anathematic to what's in my soul?
113|Saying that I love Araragi is about as impossible as me actually loving Araragi.
113|I won't be tricked. I will never again say that I love Araragi!
113|How many times will you say it? I'm not convinced.
113|Saying it so many times has turned it into a surreal gag. It's kind of funny.
113|I love Araragi. I love Araragi. I love Araragi!
113|This is fun! This is so fun, this is great!
113|I love him.
113|I love him!
113|You're the only one in the world who's laughing.
113|This has brightened my personality!
113|It has not.
113|Your personality and prospects remain dark.
113|Oh please. You can't predict the future.
113|That's true.
113|I can't tell until I've read the contents of that letter.
113|I can't believe you've strung us along until the third episode.
113|You're so good at acting self-important. It's so tempting.
113|You're still talking about that?
113|I won't. Not even if you drop that arrogant attitude of yours.
113|Did you really think I'd reveal something that hadn't been revealed in the episode in the commentary?
113|Did you think I'd let it slip?
113|Seeing as you fell for that last trap, I'd think you would let it slip under the right circumstances.
113|I'd like to see you try.
113|Though I may be brighter, my mind and tongue are still like a steel trap.
113|You truly are awful.
113|And a bizarre girl to boot.
114|Oikura's goal.
114|What does she—
114|want to know?
114|Very well. Let's look at the questions we have concerning her mother's disappearance again.
114|It's my feeling that it's the key to solving this mystery.
114|Primarily, we don't know
114|why her mother's room was locked.
114|Yeah, we don't.
114|You don't know?
114|I'm disappointed that you're incapable of solving a simple locked room mystery.
114|I knew that you were a fool, Araragi,
114|but I'm surprised you prove to be a fool as well, Hanekawa.
114|Oh, I felt I shouldn't come here, but my curiosity overruled my feelings.
114|I suppose I was worried that you wouldn't be able to help him after all, Hanekawa.
114|As I feared, then.
114|It's just not like it was in your heyday, huh?
114|It amuses me somewhat that you were still able to snatch Araragi
114|away from me.
114|How amusing that you could tempt him with your udders.
114|She's holding such a huge grudge.
114|Gosh, how embarrassing.
114|I would want to die from shame if I were you.
114|First you used your body to make him choose you, and all it led to is more trouble for Araragi.
114|Though, thinking about it, I should be ashamed as well.
114|He would not have had to struggle had I been with him,
114|End Story 1 Sodachi Lost Part Three
114|Black
114|but this happened because I allowed you to steal him with your breasts.
114|I'm very sorry I put you through this disheartening situation.
114|Honestly, I am.
114|What if he had picked me, I think to myself.
114|But I don't blame you.
114|I really don't, Araragi.
114|I don't blame you.
114|Everyone makes mistakes.
114|Right, Hanekawa?
114|You'll forgive him too, right?
114|Forgive him that he made the grave mistake of choosing you.
114|You should tell him you're sorry now.
114|"It's not your fault that I'm a fool, Araragi."
114|Hey, Ougi—
114|I already know...
114|I already know what happened
114|in that locked room.
114|And also what happened to her mother.
114|More or less.
114|In a sense.
114|What lies ahead when everything's lost?
114|I should've let it all go ages ago,
114|but I kept pushing my expectations onto you.
114|I kept diving into the sea of possibilities in search of the slimmest of chances.
114|But it seems you'll never realize
114|what exactly it is that I'm made of.
114|I leave myself in your hands, smiling innocently
114|for this unknown future is just beginning.
114|We will definitely solve the equation
114|which defines us
114|no matter how many mistakes we make.
114|To me it was an exceedingly simple exercise.
114|If you can't figure it out for yourself, Hanekawa, I can try to support my elders.
114|If you apologize for being well-endowed, I intend to react benevolently.
114|"Everything I ate went straight to my breasts."
114|"I'm incapable of solving this simple problem, so please help me, Ougi."
114|"I won't snatch Araragi away from you again."
114|If you ask for it, I might just give you the sample solution.
114|Ougi!
114|I'll ask for it!
114|You're okay with that, right?
114|If you know the solution, tell us.
114|What happened three years ago to Oikura and her mother?
114|This puts me in a bind.
114|I am honestly mad at Hanekawa, but I don't think I can turn down Araragi.
114|Don't bore us with your silence.
114|I'm starting to think you weren't very impressive in your heyday either.
114|All right.
114|Listen then, Araragi.
114|"It was a mistake to choose someone as insignificant of a person as Hanekawa."
114|"I have no partner but you."
114|"I like you more than Hanekawa."
114|Say that and I'll tell you.
114|Whatever we call the truth.
114|What is it?
114|There's no reason to hesitate.
114|You see, once Oikura is told as well,
114|I am sure she'll be very happy.
114|Isn't this the time to be repaying your debt to her?
114|Or will you choose Hanekawa's breasts by way of some flimsy excuse?
114|Hanekawa may be forced
114|to admit defeat by Ougi.
114|I don't want Hanekawa to admit defeat.
114|Stop, Araragi.
114|Don't say it.
114|Even if you'd lie, or do it for my sake, I don't want you to say that.
114|But Hanekawa...
114|Of course, I won't say what she wants either.
114|I'll steal him away from you anytime.
114|Ougi, give me ten seconds, and I will prove to you
114|that Araragi was right in choosing me.

114|Ten.

114|Eight.

114|Four.
114|Three.
114|Two.
114|One.
114|Ze—
114|Enough.
114|I win.
114|But...
114|Did you...
114|Was this really your first idea?
114|Without a more detailed investigation?
114|Just by overhearing fragments of our conversation?
114|And still you reached this conclusion first?
114|End Story 1 Sodachi Lost Part Three
114|Black
114|Yes.
114|I had an idea,
114|let my intuition guide me and adjusted the reasoning to the facts.
114|Your way of thinking is screwed up.
114|No sane human being would think of this solution first.
114|End Story 1 Sodachi Lost Part Three
114|Black
114|You eventually came to the same conclusion.
114|Who are you to be throwing stones?
114|The one whose sanity comes into question is someone else entirely.
114|Oikura, right?
114|She's the one without a shred of sanity in her.
114|Araragi, we can't.
114|We can't tell this to Oikura.
114|I think you would have told her whatever the truth was,
114|but I think your attitude will change once you hear it.
114|It will?
114|No, no, Hanekawa.
114|End Story 1 Sodachi Lost Part Three
114|Black
114|Don't spoil the fool.
114|We have to let him think for himself.
114|Otherwise he will be a fool forevermore.
114|We have to help him towards the truth.
114|A truth that makes you sick
114|the moment you hit upon it.
114|End Story 1 Sodachi Lost Part Three
114|Red
114|The worst truth I can imagine...
114|Hint one.
114|Oikura's mother is already dead.
114|Dead...
114|So...
114|Yeah...
114|Then I guess Oikura's father killed her mother,
114|and the reason she disappeared is because of whatever happened there.
114|Completely wrong.
114|How naive you are, Araragi.
114|Is a lame theory like that the worst you could possibly think of?
114|All right, Hanekawa.
114|Hint two, please.
114|Y-You want me to?
114|Hint two.
114|Just like you mistook her home for a ruin,
114|Oikura was also mistaken about her mother.
114|She still is.
114|So... Oikura's mother was killed by Oikura, but she doesn't remember it?
114|Hint three.
114|Disappearing from a locked room doesn't necessarily mean they left it.
114|So when Oikura unlocked the door,
114|her mother was hiding behind the door or something and snuck out after her?
114|Why would anybody do that?
114|Hint four.
114|If she's already dead, why hasn't the corpse been found?
114|Why is she still listed as missing?
114|Missing Person Report
114|Hint five.
114|I based my solution on what I heard from you,
114|but even if you had picked me as your partner,
114|there would have been something I couldn't have determined.
114|What is it?
114|Hint six.
114|Oikura's last home was too large to clean for her, and it turned into a big mess.
114|Hint seven.
114|Her mother had disappeared suddenly one day.
114|One day, a certain day.
114|What about the day before?
114|Hint eight.
114|Oikura's mother suffered greatly from her divorce.
114|So much she locked herself in her room.
114|Enough to lose the will to live.
114|Hint nine.
114|Oikura cooked for her mother, but her mother stopped eating completely.
114|I'm sure you independently toned down the word "completely" here
114|Completely
114|to mean that she still ate a little.
114|Hint ten.
114|Oikura said her mother stopped responding when she spoke to her.
114|Hint eleven.
114|She stopped leaving the corner of the room.
114|Hint twelve.
114|She didn't eat.
114|She didn't listen.
114|She didn't speak.
114|She didn't move.
114|Is that still life?
114|Hint thirteen.
114|Can someone in middle school really take care of their reclusive parent for years?
114|A corpse would be manageable.
114|Hint fourteen.
114|How long can a corpse be identified as such?
114|Hint fifteen.
114|Hint sixteen.
114|Hint seventeen.
114|Hint eighteen.
114|Hint nineteen.
114|Hint twenty.

114|Hint forty-seven.
114|Hint forty-eight.
114|Hint forty-nine.
114|Hint fifty.
114|I got it, goddamn!
114|Oikura looked after a corpse for almost two years, right?
114|The corpse rotted away until everything was gone.
114|And she didn't realize it!
114|Yes.
114|I overlooked the truth two years ago during the class meeting.
114|I overlooked it five years ago.
114|Even now I can't remember what happened six years ago.
114|That is why
114|I cannot run away here.
114|I have to look it in the eye.
114|Correct answer.
114|Oikura's mother didn't suddenly disappear.
114|She slowly starved to death.
114|Then she slowly rotted away.
114|When the body had decomposed to a point that rendered it unidentifiable as such,
114|Oikura thought her mother had left.
114|It's like the boiling water.
114|She said she hates water that thinks it boils without assistance, right?
114|Well, her mother boiled without assistance.
114|Water.
114|She boiled and evaporated.
114|She hasn't left the room.
114|She didn't disappear like smoke would.
114|She disappeared like water.
114|Well, human beings aren't composed of only water.
114|What about the rest?
114|I assume they threw it out with the rest of the junk when the house was cleaned out.
114|So this is...
114|Suicide by starvation?
114|I don't really think so.
114|She surely lost the will to live on, but I don't think that's the same thing as suicide.
114|Losing the will to live and wanting to die are two different things.
114|What do you think, Hanekawa?
114|I just think it would be best if Oikura was never told of this.
114|Perhaps, but I'm sure Oikura knows something is wrong.
114|That something doesn't fit.
114|That she is hiding something.
114|That she is pretending to not understand something.
114|I'm sure she's felt that way these past three years.
114|And she will feel that for the rest of her life.
114|No, I will end it today.
114|I'll talk to her.
114|She will hear it from me.
114|I'll go back to her and tell her everything.
114|The people from town hall have surely left by now.
114|I'll go alone.
114|Please wait for me here.
114|Are you sure, Araragi?
114|Yeah.
114|I told you earlier.
114|I've pretended not to see her for a long time now.
114|For more than six years.
114|Just like she was oblivious to her mother's death,
114|I was oblivious to her.
114|I can't leave her alone now.
114|There's no telling what will happen, Araragi.
114|She might start to hate you even more.
114|She can't possibly hate me any more.
114|Even if she could, I'm fine with that if it lets her love herself.
114|I'll teach her how to be happy,
114|though my experience is little more than hers.
114|But my student is the outstanding Oikura.
114|Once she gets the hang of it,
114|I'm sure she'll surpass me in no time.
114|But happiness isn't a competition.
114|When she surpasses me, I can then learn from her.
114|Together we will study, learn, and become better people.
114|Let us have a study session.
114|We two are limitless fools,
114|but let us become wise together.
114|Let us be happy.
114|Araragi.
114|Will you repay your debt with further injury?
114|I'm glad I have something to repay her with, even if it will hurt her.
114|Now for the epilogue—Or rather, the outcome.
114|The next day I was woken up by my little sisters, Karen and Tsukihi, and went on my way to school.
114|I asked my little sisters whether they remembered a girl staying at our place for a while in grade school.
114|Both said they didn't.
114|Oikura wouldn't come to school.
114|Even if I went today, she isn't there.
114|Our deal had to be scrapped, but there was nothing we could do.
114|The people from the town hall told me that my welfare would be cut in half.
114|They said I can't stay here either.
114|But I'll be fine.
114|They found me a smaller apartment.
114|I have to move.
114|I'll transfer away from Naoetsu High School.
114|She was incredibly calm as she said that.
114|This is what she's like when I'm the only one around,
114|just like in middle school during summer break.
114|When I told her of our conjecture regarding her mother,
114|her immediate acceptance was anticlimactic.
114|I see.
114|I had a hunch, I guess.
114|I knew I'd have to leave this town soon,
114|but when Tetsujou went on leave, I went back to school.
114|I thought something might happen, something might change.
114|And then—
114|I talked to her some more and went home.
114|No detours.
114|And so today I am unafraid of seeing her in class as I go to school.
114|'Sup, Araragi.
114|That's no way to talk to your senior.
114|Hey, Ougi.
114|Why did you go home without me yesterday?
114|I told you to wait for me.
114|Hanekawa suggested we go home.
114|Why did she say that?
114|She meant well.
114|She wanted to give you some privacy with her.
114|Don't put it like that.
114|I was really startled when I didn't find you two in the square.
114|I lost yesterday.
114|I'm very sorry.
114|Frankly, I underestimated you.
114|I thought you'd turn tail and run.
114|You showed unexpected courage at the end.
114|Private High School
114|You know, it's pretty weird.
114|The day you transferred here, Tetsujou went on maternity leave,
114|Naoetsu Private High School
114|End Story 1 Sodachi Lost Part Three
114|Black
114|Oikura came back to school,
114|Naoetsu Private High School
114|End Story 1 Sodachi Lost Part Three
114|Black
114|and now she's transferred out again.
114|Naoetsu Private High School
114|The things I brushed under the carpet or left alone jolt into action like memories risen from the deep.
114|Oh, is Oikura transferring schools?
114|I didn't know.
114|She was cast so well, too.
114|I do hope she'll be happy wherever she goes now.
114|I'm sure she'll be successful on greener pastures where no one knows her.
114|Because of you.
114|Thanks to you.
114|What are you doing here, Ougi?
114|Do you live here?
114|I'm looking for a girl who's lost.
114|That is, in the end, how it all begins.
114|I lost this round.
114|Permit me to be a sore loser,
114|but the first round is a training session anyway.
114|How were you going to treat your childhood friend?
114|I accomplished my goal of finding that out.
114|Losing is perfect as far as balance is concerned.
114|Be careful, Araragi.
114|There's no guarantee it'll go so well next time.
114|The future is shrouded in darkness
114|even when the sun is up.

114|I see. Too bad.
114|I thought I'd really hit it off with her.
114|Let us pray she finds happiness in her new life.
114|Yeah.
114|Ougi said that too.
114|Araragi, I have to hand in a form of temporary absence.
114|Can you go ahead to the classroom?
114|Sure.
114|Uh, temporary absence?
114|Are you leaving Naoetsu High School too?
114|No, temporary. Temporary!
114|When I graduate I want to drift around the world for a while,
114|so I thought I'd look at a couple of locations.
114|I'll make a couple of stops around the world.
114|I'll be back in a month. Take care of things here, please.
114|If I run into Oshino somewhere, I'll talk to him.
114|Tell him we met his niece if you see him.
114|Yes. That's one of my main goals.
114|Mark as unread
114|To Koyokoyo, Totally broke finger Going to hospital before school today
114|Don't write like a telegram.
114|To Yokoyoko Oikura came to apologize this morning. Forgave her. I'm fine
114|Yokoyoko?
114|To Yokoyoko Oikura came to apologize this morning. Forgave her. I'm fine
114|(but I have a broken finger)
114|It looks like Oikura kept the part of the promise that meant making up with Senjougahara.
114|That's good.
114|I need to show this message to Hanekawa before she leaves.
114|Koyokoyo, I'm sorry you're worried. I'll give you lots of deep kisses on our next date, okay? Deeply addicted to your kiss
114|I can't show her this message.
114|Message from Oikura. Says "under the desk" Yours, better half
114|Yours, better half
114|"Yours, better half"?
114|What kind of salutation is that?
114|Did I not find the same envelope five years ago, during summer vacation, taped to the underside of a coffee table?
114|The envelope back then was empty.
114|I could feel the paper inside this time.
114|There was no sender or receiver on it,
114|but I knew full well who taped this to my desk.
114|Oikura Sodachi.
114|She kept all her promises.
114|Vanishing unheralded
114|seems to be no longer part of her repertoire.
114|Not much had changed, but at least something had.
114|That made me glad, but seeing her walk ahead also saddened me.
114|To show her that I, too, had matured,
114|I opened the letter carefully
114|without ripping it open like I did five years earlier.
114|Within I found countless sheets of paper.
114|What were the contents of this letter? Math questions?
114|Unbefitting words of gratitude?
114|Strings of abuse?
114|All of it was possible.
114|Let's see.
114|I broke into a broad smile.
114|Hey.
114|What do you think was written there?
114|I hear your laughter near me
114|You were supposed to be there forever
114|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
114|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
114|I heard your voice from the hallway
114|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
114|At some point I became unable
114|to talk to you normally
114|I can hear your laughter a ways away
114|You were supposed to be next to me forever
114|You knew how I felt
114|even when I said nothing
114|Now I know how important you were to me,
114|but we will never see each other again
115|Oikura's goal.
115|What does she—
115|want to know?
115|Very well. Let's look at the questions we have concerning her mother's disappearance again.
115|It's my feeling that it's the key to solving this mystery.
115|Primarily, we don't know
115|why her mother's room was locked.
115|Yeah, we don't.
115|You don't know?
115|I'm disappointed that you're incapable of solving a simple locked room mystery.
115|Araragi-senpai, I knew that you were a fool.
115|but, Hanekawa-senpai, I'm surprised you prove to be a fool as well.
115|Oh, I felt that I shouldn't come here, but my curiosity overruled my feelings.
115|I suppose, Hanekawa-senpai, I was worried that you wouldn't be able to help Araragi-senpai after all.
115|As I feared, then.
115|It's just not like it was in your heyday, huh?
115|It amuses me somewhat that you were still able to snatch Araragi-senpai
115|away from me.
115|How amusing that you could tempt Araragi-senpai with your udders.
115|She's holding such a huge grudge.
115|Gosh, how embarrassing.
115|I would want to die from shame if I were you.
115|Araragi-senpai was lured in by your body, and all it led to was more trouble for him.
115|Though, thinking about it, I should be ashamed as well.
115|Had I been with him, Araragi-senpai would not have had to struggle,
115|Owarimonogatari Episode Seven, Sodachi Lost, Part Three
115|Black Scene
115|but this happened because I allowed you to steal him with your breasts.
115|Araragi-senpai, I'm very sorry I put you through this disheartening situation.
115|Honestly, I am.
115|What if Araragi-senpai had picked me, I think to myself.
115|But I don't blame you.
115|I really don't, Araragi-senpai.
115|I don't blame you.
115|Everyone makes mistakes.
115|Right, Hanekawa-senpai?
115|Hanekawa-senpai, you'll forgive him, too, right?
115|Forgive Araragi-senpai for making the grave mistake of choosing you.
115|You should tell him you're sorry now.
115|"It's not your fault that I'm a fool, Araragi-kun."
115|Hey, Ougi-chan—
115|I already know...
115|I already know what happened
115|in that locked room.
115|And also what happened to her mother.
115|More or less.
115|In a sense.
115|subete ushinatta saki ni nani ga aru no?
115|What lies ahead when everything's lost?

115|I kept diving into the sea of possibilities in search of the slimmest of chances.

115|bokura wo shoumei suru bokura no houteishiki wa

115|which defines us
115|nandodemo mata machigainagara
115|no matter how many mistakes we make.
115|To me, it was an exceedingly simple exercise.
115|Hanekawa-senpai, if you can't figure it out for yourself, I can try to support my elders.
115|If you apologize for being well-endowed, I intend to react benevolently.
115|"Everything I ate went straight to my breasts."
115|"Please help me, Ougi-chan, for I'm incapable of solving this simple problem."
115|"I won't snatch Araragi-kun away from you again."
115|If you ask for it, I might just give you the sample solution.
115|Ougi-chan!
115|I'll ask for it!
115|You're okay with that, right?
115|If you know the solution, tell us.
115|Three years ago, what happened to Oikura and her mother?
115|This puts me in a bind.
115|I am honestly mad at Hanekawa-senpai, but I don't think I can turn down Araragi-senpai.
115|Don't bore us with your silence.
115|I'm starting to think you weren't very impressive in your heyday, either.
115|All right.
115|Listen, Araragi-senpai.
115|"It was a mistake to choose someone as insignificant of a person as Hanekawa."
115|"I have no partner but you, Ougi-chan."
115|"I like you more than I like Hanekawa, Ougi-chan."
115|Say that and I'll tell you.
115|Whatever we call the truth.
115|What is it?
115|There's no reason to hesitate.
115|You see, once Oikura-senpai is told as well,
115|I am sure she'll be very happy.
115|Isn't this the time to repay your debt to Oikura-senpai?
115|Or will you choose Hanekawa-senpai's breasts by way of some flimsy excuse?
115|Hanekawa may be forced
115|to admit defeat by Ougi.
115|I don't want Hanekawa to admit defeat.
115|Stop, Araragi-kun.
115|Don't say it.
115|Even if you'd lie, or do it for my sake, Araragi-kun, I don't want you to say that.
115|But Hanekawa...
115|Of course, I won't say what she wants, either.
115|I'll steal him away from you anytime.
115|Ougi-chan, give me ten seconds, and I will prove to you
115|that Araragi-kun was right in choosing me.

115|But...
115|Did you...
115|Was this really your first idea?
115|Without a more detailed investigation?
115|Just by overhearing fragments of our conversation?
115|And still you reached this conclusion first?
115|Owarimonogatari Episode Seven, Sodachi Lost, Part Three
115|Black Scene
115|Yes.
115|I had an idea,
115|let my intuition guide me, and adjusted the reasoning to the facts.
115|Your way of thinking is screwed up.
115|No sane human being would think of this solution first.
115|Owarimonogatari Episode Seven, Sodachi Lost, Part Three
115|Black Scene
115|You eventually came to the same conclusion.
115|Who are you to be throwing stones?
115|The one whose sanity comes into question is someone else entirely.
115|Oikura-senpai, right?
115|She's the one without a shred of sanity in her.
115|Araragi-kun, we can't.
115|We can't tell this to Oikura-san.
115|Araragi-kun, I think you would have told her whatever the truth was,
115|but I think your attitude will change once you hear it.
115|It will?
115|That's no good, Hanekawa-senpai.
115|Owarimonogatari Episode Seven, Sodachi Lost, Part Three
115|Black Scene
115|Don't spoil the fool.
115|We have to let Araragi-senpai think for himself.
115|Otherwise, Araragi-senpai will be a fool forevermore.
115|Araragi-senpai must be guided toward the truth.
115|A truth that makes you sick
115|the moment you hit upon it.
115|Owarimonogatari Episode Seven, Sodachi Lost, Part Three
115|Red Scene
115|The worst truth I can imagine...
115|Hint one.
115|Oikura-senpai's mother is already dead.
115|Dead...
115|So...
115|Yeah...
115|Oikura's father probably killed her mother.
115|She disappeared because of whatever happened there.
115|Completely wrong.
115|How naive you are, Araragi-senpai.
115|Is a lame theory like that the worst you could possibly think of?
115|All right, Hanekawa-senpai.
115|Hint two, please.
115|Y-You want me to?
115|Hint two.
115|Araragi-kun, just like you mistook Oikura-san's home for a ruin,
115|Oikura-san was also mistaken about her mother.
115|She still is.
115|So... Oikura's mother was killed by Oikura, but she doesn't remember it?
115|Hint three.
115|Disappearing from a locked room doesn't necessarily mean they left it.
115|So when Oikura unlocked the door,
115|her mother was hiding behind the door or something and snuck out after Oikura?
115|Why would anybody do that?
115|Hint four.
115|Araragi-kun, if her mother's already dead, why hasn't the corpse been found?
115|Why is she still listed as missing?
115|Missing Person Report
115|Hint five.
115|I based my solution on what I heard from you,
115|but, Araragi-senpai, even if you had picked me as your partner,
115|there would have been something about Oikura-senpai that I couldn't have determined.
115|What is it?
115|Hint six.
115|Oikura-san's last home was too large to clean for her, and it turned into a big mess.
115|Hint seven.
115|Her mother had disappeared suddenly one day.
115|One day, a certain day.
115|What about the day before?
115|Hint eight.
115|Oikura-san's mother suffered greatly from her divorce.
115|So much she locked herself in her room.
115|Enough to lose the will to live.
115|Hint nine.
115|Oikura-senpai cooked for her mother, but her mother stopped eating completely.
115|I'm sure you independently toned down the word "completely" here
115|[Completely]
115|to mean that she still ate a little.
115|Hint ten.
115|Oikura-san said her mother stopped responding when she spoke to her.
115|Hint eleven.
115|She stopped leaving the corner of the room.
115|Hint twelve.
115|She didn't eat.
115|She didn't listen.
115|She didn't speak.
115|She didn't move.
115|Is that still life?
115|Hint thirteen.
115|Can someone in middle school really take care of their reclusive parent for years?
115|A corpse would be manageable.
115|Hint fourteen.
115|How long can a corpse be identified as such?

115|Hint forty-seven.
115|Hint forty-eight.
115|Hint forty-nine.
115|Hint fifty.
115|I got it, god damn it!
115|Oikura looked after a corpse for almost two years, right?
115|The corpse rotted away until everything was gone.
115|And she didn't realize it!
115|Yes.
115|I overlooked the truth two years ago during the class meeting.
115|I overlooked it five years ago.
115|Even now, I can't remember what happened six years ago.
115|That is why
115|I cannot run away here.
115|I have to look it in the eye.
115|Correct answer.
115|Oikura-senpai's mother didn't suddenly disappear.
115|She slowly starved to death.
115|Then she slowly rotted away.
115|When the body had decomposed to a point that rendered it unidentifiable as such,
115|She thought her mother had left.
115|It's like the boiling water.
115|She said she hates water that thinks it boils without assistance, right?
115|Well, Oikura-senpai's mother boiled without assistance.
115|Water.
115|She boiled and evaporated.
115|She hasn't left the room.
115|She didn't disappear like smoke would.
115|She disappeared like water.
115|Well, human beings aren't composed of only water.
115|What about the rest?
115|I assume they threw it out with the rest of the junk when the house was cleaned out.
115|So this is...
115|Suicide by starvation?
115|I don't really think so.
115|She surely lost the will to live on, but I don't think that's the same thing as suicide.
115|Losing the will to live and wanting to die are two different things.
115|Hanekawa-senpai, what do you think?
115|I just think it would be best if Oikura-san were never told of this.
115|Perhaps, but I'm sure she knows something is wrong.
115|That something doesn't fit.
115|That she is hiding something.
115|That she is pretending to not understand something.
115|I'm sure she's felt that way these past three years.
115|And she will feel that for the rest of her life.
115|No, I'll end it today.
115|I'll talk to her.
115|She'll hear it from me.
115|I'll go back to Oikura and tell her everything.
115|The people from the town hall have surely left by now.
115|I'll go alone.
115|Please wait for me here.
115|Araragi-kun, are you sure?
115|Yeah.
115|I told you earlier.
115|I've pretended to not see Oikura for a long time now.
115|For more than six years.
115|Just like she was oblivious to her mother's death,
115|I was oblivious to her.
115|I can't leave Oikura alone now.
115|There's no telling what will happen, Araragi-senpai.
115|Oikura-senpai might start to hate you even more.
115|She can't possibly hate me any more.
115|Even if she could, I'm fine with that if it lets her love herself.
115|I'll teach her how to be happy,
115|though my experience is little more than hers.
115|But my student is the outstanding Oikura.
115|Once she gets the hang of it,
115|I'm sure she'll surpass me in no time.
115|But happiness isn't a competition.
115|When she surpasses me, I can learn from her.
115|Together, we will study, learn, and become better people.
115|Let's have a study session.
115|The two of us are limitless fools,
115|but let us hone our intelligence.
115|Let us be happy.
115|Araragi-senpai.
115|Will you repay your debt with further injury?
115|I'm glad I have something to repay her with, even if it will hurt Oikura.
115|Now for the epilogue—Or rather, the outcome.
115|The next day, I was woken up by my little sisters, Karen and Tsukihi, and went on my way to school.
115|I asked my little sisters whether they remembered a girl staying at our place for a while in grade school.
115|Both said they didn't.
115|Oikura wouldn't come to school.
115|Even if I went today, Oikura isn't there.
115|Our deal had to be scrapped, but there was nothing we could do.
115|The people from the town hall told me that my welfare would be cut in half.
115|They said I can't stay here, either.
115|But I'll be fine.
115|They found me a smaller apartment.
115|I have to move.
115|I'll transfer away from Naoetsu High School.
115|She was incredibly calm as she said that.
115|This is what Oikura's like when I'm the only one around,
115|just like in middle school during summer break.
115|When I told her of our conjecture regarding her mother,
115|Oikura's immediate acceptance was anticlimactic.
115|I see.
115|I had a hunch, I guess.
115|I knew I'd have to leave this town soon,
115|but when Tetsujou went on leave, I went back to school.
115|I thought something might happen, that something might change.
115|And then—
115|I talked to Oikura some more and went home.
115|No detours.
115|And so, today I am unafraid of seeing Oikura in class as I go to school.
115|Hi, Araragi-senpai.
115|"Hi" isn't a proper greeting.
115|Hey, Ougi-chan.
115|Why did you go home without me yesterday?
115|I told you to wait for me.
115|Hanekawa-senpai suggested we go home.
115|Why did Hanekawa say that?
115|She meant well.
115|She wanted to give you some privacy with her.
115|Don't put it like that.
115|I was really startled when I didn't find you two in the square.
115|I lost yesterday.
115|I'm very sorry.
115|Frankly, I underestimated you.
115|Araragi-senpai, I thought you'd turn tail and run.
115|You showed unexpected courage at the end.
115|Front gates of Naoetsu High School
115|Private High School
115|You know, it's pretty weird.
115|The day you transferred here, Tetsujou went on maternity leave,
115|Naoetsu Private High School

115|Black Scene
115|and now she's transferred out again.
115|Naoetsu Private High School
115|The things I brushed under the carpet or left alone jolt into action like memories risen from the deep.
115|Oh, is Oikura-senpai transferring away?
115|I didn't know.
115|She was cast so well, too.
115|I do hope she'll be happy wherever she goes now.
115|I'm sure she'll be successful on greener pastures where no one knows her.
115|Araragi-senpai, because of you.
115|Thanks to you.
115|Ougi-chan, what are you doing here?
115|Do you live here?
115|I'm looking for a girl who's lost.
115|That is, in the end, how it all begins.
115|I lost this round.
115|Permit me to be a sore loser,
115|but the first round is a training session anyway.
115|How were you going to treat your childhood friend?
115|I accomplished my goal of finding that out.
115|Losing is perfect as far as balance is concerned.
115|Be careful, Araragi-senpai.
115|There's no guarantee it'll go so well next time.
115|The future is shrouded in darkness
115|even when the sun is up.
115|Owarimonogatari Episode Seven, Sodachi Lost, Part Three

115|I see. Too bad.
115|Oikura-san and I really seemed to hit it off.
115|Let us pray she finds happiness in her new life.
115|Yeah.
115|Ougi-chan said that, too.
115|Araragi-kun, I have to hand in a form of temporary absence.
115|Can you go ahead to the classroom?
115|Sure.
115|Uh, temporary absence?
115|Are you leaving Naoetsu High School, too?
115|No, temporary. Temporary!
115|When I graduate, I want to drift around the world for a while,
115|so I thought I'd look at a couple of locations.
115|I'll make a couple of stops around the world.
115|I'll be back in a month. Take care of things here, please.
115|If I run into Oshino-san somewhere, I'll talk to him.
115|If you see him, tell him that we met his niece.
115|Yes. That's one of my main goals.
115|Mark as unread
115|To Koyokoyo,
115|Totally broke finger
115|Going to hospital before school today
115|Don't write like it's a telegram.
115|To Yokoyoko
115|Oikura came to apologize this morning.
115|Yokoyoko?
115|To Yokoyoko
115|Oikura came to apologize this morning.
115|Forgave her.
115|I'm fine
115|Oikura came to apologize this morning.
115|Forgave her.
115|I'm fine
115|(but I have a broken finger)
115|It looks like Oikura kept the part of the promise that meant making up with Senjougahara.
115|That's good.
115|I need to show this message to Hanekawa before she leaves.
115|Koyokoyo, I'm sorry you're worried.
115|I'll give you
115|lots of deep kisses
115|on our next date,
115|okay?
115|Deeply addicted to your kiss
115|Koyokoyo, I'm sorry you're worried.
115|I'll give you
115|lots of deep kisses
115|on our next date,
115|okay?
115|Deeply addicted to your kiss
115|I can't show her this message.
115|Message from Oikura.
115|Says "under the desk"
115|Yours, better half
115|"Yours, better half"?
115|What kind of salutation is that?
115|Did I not find the same envelope five years ago, during summer vacation, taped to the underside of a coffee table?
115|The envelope back then was empty.
115|I could feel the paper inside this time.
115|There was no sender or receiver on it,
115|but I knew full well who taped this to my desk.
115|Oikura Sodachi.
115|She kept all her promises.
115|Front gates of Naoetsu High School
115|Vanishing unheralded
115|seems to no longer be part of her repertoire.
115|Not much had changed, but at least something had.
115|That made me glad, but seeing her walk ahead also saddened me.
115|To show her that I, too, had matured,
115|I opened the letter carefully
115|without ripping it open like I did five years earlier.
115|Within, I found countless sheets of paper.
115|What were the contents of this letter? Math questions?
115|Unbefitting words of gratitude?
115|Strings of abuse?
115|All of it was possible.
115|Let's see.
115|I broke into a broad smile.
115|Hey.
115|What do you think was written there?
115|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
115|I hear your laughter beyond the door
115|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
115|You were supposed to be with me forever
115|kyoushitsu no mado ni iki o haite kaita
115|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
115|namae o awatete sode de keshita
115|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
115|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara
115|I heard your voice from the hallway
115|kokoro gomakasu you ni hayaashi de kaetta
115|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings

115|At some point I became unable

115|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
115|I can hear your laughter beyond the door

115|You were supposed to be next to me forever

115|You knew how I felt

116|Silence.
116|We will now carry out the commentary for Owarimonogatari: Sodachi Lost, Part Three.
116|"Carry out?"
116|Looks like the trial's moved to the sentencing phase.
116|Based on what's come out of your mouth, I think anything you get sentenced to is appropriate.
116|If you say I should be silenced, then I say you should be purged.
116|You're going to purge me?
116|Chairman, I motion that you be dismissed.
116|Not on my watch.
116|Stop blocking the booth doors.
116|Don't you dare detain me! Come back here!
116|I wish I could be dismissed.
116|Fine. I'm back.
116|Well, it took all of you 32 seconds to quiet down.
116|Do you have any idea what we could've accomplished in 32 seconds?
116|Is this a pep talk?
116|If I had 32 seconds, I could've put 32 staples through your cheek.
116|How could you say something so horrifying?
116|Nobody with a shred of humanity would ever do that!
116|You sure?
116|Is it more proper to accept one's inhumanity, or more proper to staple the cheek of your fellow man?
116|The first one, obviously!
116|Perhaps.
116|But is a proper thing always just?
116|Stop trying to throw me off.
116|Ougi-san certainly seems to be adept at doing that.
116|Hanekawa-san and Araragi-kun seem to have thoroughly been thrown off the scent this episode.
116|They're completely perplexed.
116|Well, if you're telling me that they're being tormented by their state of confusion,
116|then I suppose that's good news to me.
116|If that's the good news, then I guess the bad news is that you're a scumbag.
116|If you're talking bad news, I get it all the time.
116|What kind of life do you lead?
116|If you're as professional as I am,
116|the very existence of good news is bad news in and of itself.
116|Something good happened.
116|Which means I need to ready myself for disappointment.
116|The good news put me on notice.
116|What?
116|So you're readying yourself for disappointment,
116|even when you're having such fun chatting with me?
116|I'm disappointed as we speak.
116|I'm disappointed in you, in the present continuous tense.
116|Oh please. I bet you're head over heels for me, right?
116|In your dreams.
116|I hate you. I hate your guts!
116|I hate you second only to Araragi!
116|Meaning you love me more than him.
116|You can't possibly have an attitude that positive.
116|I've been heroically holding myself back until now,
116|but it's not like you were all that popular in tenth grade, either.
116|Well that's strange.
116|I seem to remember being called the "Cloistered Maiden."
116|Perhaps that's what the boys called you.
116|But the girls called you—
116|Stop. I don't think I can handle any more than that.
116|You give up too quickly.
116|Come to think of it, I can't be certain if I was being
116|complimented when people referred to me as the "Cloistered Maiden."
116|The avant-title is over.
116|We will now carry out the opening.
116|Wait, weren't you fired?
116|The motion didn't pass.
116|Stop acting like a leader.
116|You're already the object of derision after you
116|made a big show of leaving, only to slink back into town.
116|I did not "slink" back into town.
116|To be honest, I was surprised when I heard that you'd be appearing in this commentary.
116|I thought characters like you were never invited to do them.
116|And what is that supposed to mean?
116|Give me an example.
116|An easy-to-understand example would be Kanbaru's friend, Numachi Rouka.
116|I really would've liked to hear a commentary from those two.
116|Numachi Rouka...
116|I think I hate her.
116|Don't hate her after only hearing her name.
116|You hate anyone and everyone too easily.
116|Let's see, who else...? The con man.
116|I didn't want to point out anyone in particular... But the con man.
116|A commentary that has "clean" as its motto can't
116|put a man who violates all of society's accepted morals on air.
116|If our motto really is "clean,"
116|then why did we bring on a violator of society's morals such as yourself?
116|Why are you here, anyway?
116|The hell's that supposed to mean?
116|I came because I was asked to.
116|Oh, I see. I get it now.
116|You're hardly ever invited to anything,
116|so you'll go anytime you're invited to something.
116|You didn't slink back; you were skipping all the way.
116|I'm not that kind of person.
116|Though I never do get invited to anything,
116|you're wrong.
116|This is Part A.
116|My job's been hijacked!
116|Did the motion pass?
116|The "A" in "Part A" is short for "Answer."
116|As you can see, Hanekawa-san and Ougi-san are attempting to engage in a battle of wits.
116|As we bide our time here, please reveal the contents of the letter, Oikura-san.
116|You can set all the conditions you want, but I won't tell.
116|If that's how you want to play it, I'll reveal what the other girls called you,
116|as well as how I covered for you.
116|You were covering for me? My bad.
116|And here I thought you were behind it all.
116|"My bad?" What's with that apology?
116|It sounded awfully superficial to me!
116|I'll bet the contents of that letter were no different.
116|It wasn't superficial!
116|I wrote that— Oops!
116|If you nearly fell for a trap like that, I think it's only a matter of time until I can get my answer.
116|Well, I might say stuff like this, but I do understand what's going on.
116|This whole thing's a riddle story, right?
116|Riddle story?
116|Yes. In other words, the author hasn't presented a clear-cut answer.
116|The kind of mystery where it's left to the reader's interpretation.
116|Now that I think about it, the previous book was called "Sodachi Riddle," wasn't it?
116|In a story where the events align themselves into a mystery,
116|it ends with Araragi-kun asking, "What do you think it said?"
116|So the actual answer remains a mystery, replaced by each viewer's interpretation.
116|That's how it works, right?
116|That's right.
116|Huh. So you actually do get it.
116|Although I understand, I still want to ask:
116|What was in the damn letter?
116|Watch your tone.
116|It sounds like you're threatening me.
116|Don't put your hand in your pocket. What is it?
116|It's not a stapler, is it?
116|To be completely honest,
116|I was so excited when I thought that they would reveal the letter's contents in Part Four.
116|There's no part four.
116|But you were looking forward to it, huh?
116|If you put it that way, it almost makes me feel as though I should've revealed it.
116|I was looking forward to how vindictive you'd be, judging from how twisted your personality is.
116|You're the twisted one here!
116|Seems like I made the right choice.
116|When I realized this was a riddle story, I desperately thought about what the letter's contents could've been.
116|There's no need for desperation.
116|Trust me, there was nothing in that letter to get desperate over.
116|I arrived at all sorts of amusing conclusions while researching what it all meant.
116|Stop getting all excited about me behind my back! I bet you were badmouthing me again!
116|But of course. What more is there to say?
116|Don't ever speak agian.
116|Ah, it's Hanekawa-san.
116|I love this part.
116|When Hanekawa-san goes into deep thought.
116|It's rare to see someone with her intelligence put some serious thought into something.
116|Isn't this great, Oikura-san?
116|I know, right? Thank you.
116|I haven't said anything.
116|You say all that, but the truth is that I really don't know what she's usually like.
116|Wait, why is her hair all speckled after washing it?
116|Oh, that's a riddle story.
116|It's still a mystery.
116|Liar.
116|Stop misusing the term "riddle story."
116|There's an actual reason behind this, right?
116|If you're going to complain about Hanekawa-san's hair,
116|then I'd like to ask what you think about those twintails of yours.
116|There's no mystery greater than that of your twintails.
116|There's no mystery behind my twintails.
116|But Riddler...
116|I'm not a DC villain!
116|Still, you seem really obsessed over your twintails.
116|It's not an obsession!
116|Fine, I'll untie them right here. There.
116|Oh no, the seal!
116|Nothing's been sealed.
116|Alright. Now there's nothing to complain about.
116|Now you're left with plain old straight hair.
116|Don't refer to it that way!
116|Are you going to complain, no matter what hairstyle I wear?
116|The combination of your harsh personality and twintails was scary, but
116|so is the contrast between your twisted nature and straight hair.
116|And now you go beyond my hair and attack my personality.
116|You had straight hair in tenth grade too!
116|Ah, geez. These bangs are getting in the way!
116|You act cranky towards your hair too?
116|Do you ever calm down?
116|These... bangs...
116|These bangs. These bangs!
116|With that state of mind, there's no wonder you'd wear twintails.
116|I'm going to borrow these hair ties.
116|What?
116|I thought I'd try twintails.
116|There we go.
116|Well I guess I don't mind, but...
116|Is your hair long enough?
116|I think it'll work if I try.
116|There. How's it look?
116|Well if you want my opinion...
116|The tails are so short that it makes you look more childish.
116|I've worn ponytails before,
116|but this is the first time I've worn twintails.
116|It's a shame the audio commentary won't allow people to see.
116|Now you're obsessed with twintails.
116|Sit still for a minute.
116|I want to see my reflection in those eyes of yours.
116|Quit checking yourself out using my eyes.
116|Don't you have a mirror with you?
116|You're too close!
116|Don't get closer than necessary!
116|Tsk.
116|Your bangs are in the way; I can't kiss you.
116|Stop trying to kiss me, damn it!
116|These bangs do make it an effort to talk, though.
116|Want me to secure them with my stapler?
116|T/N: Hotchkiss is the Japanese word for stapler.
116|Is this some kind of pun between kiss and Hotchkiss?
116|Wait, do you really have a stapler? Give my hair ties back.
116|But I just started wearing these twintails!
116|That's right. You can use these rubber bands instead.
116|What kind of exchange rate is that?
116|Come now. You get to have the sight of my twintails all to yourself.
116|Bask in the glory.
116|Like I said, I can't see because of my bangs.
116|Your bangs are in the way, huh?
116|That's right. You seem to find convenient ways to avoid seeing all sorts of things.
116|About Araragi-kun, for instance.
116|Or as the people onscreen are currently discussing, your mother.
116|Surely you realize that your neat little explanation won't cut it.
116|My mother didn't disappear because my bangs were long.
116|By the way, and you don't have to answer this if you don't want to, but
116|did your mother also have twintails?
116|I don't wanna answer, so I won't!
116|Stop caring about how people's parents do their hair!
116|Anyway, I do admire the deductive skills of Hanekawa-san and Ougi-san.
116|I don't think I would've been able to solve this mystery, even if you gave me the story behind it.
116|I definitely wouldn't have told you.
116|Referring to me in the second person seems to be becoming the norm.
116|Perhaps this commentary's bringing us closer together.
116|Other way around. A complete 180. We've grown so far apart that I can't even see you.
116|T/N: This is a pun that combines お前 (omae: you) and 前髪 (maegami: bangs)
116|Because of the bangs?
116|How about I bang your face?
116|What's that supposed to mean?
116|You really shouldn't yell at a little girl like me.
116|Undo those twintails! They're pissing me off!
116|This is less "Sodachi Riddle" and more "Hitagi Lollidle."
116|What are you talking about? "Lollidle?" Seriously?
116|You're all the riddle we need!
116|Back to normal, I see. And touchier than ever.
116|No, I just felt better when I saw Araragi
116|floundering around onscreen while those girls put him into a predicament.
116|Your mood is influenced way too strongly by Araragi-kun.
116|But isn't it great? It's so hilarious how Araragi-kun gets driven into a corner during Part A!
116|I think your mind's what's being driven into a corner.
116|Stop bursting out in laughter. Please.
116|Isn't that how vampires laugh?
116|Araragi's suffering!
116|Ahhh, this is all I need to feel bliss!
116|Wow, I didn't realize that bliss was so easy to achieve!
116|She's taking this in the wrong direction.
116|It was just as Araragi said.
116|I've been overestimating happiness.
116|Happiness does suit me!
116|I mean, the pointless joy you're experiencing might be perfect for you, but...
116|Wait a minute.
116|"Just as Araragi said." "Just as Araragi said?"
116|Screw that! There's no way that could happen!
116|It only makes me unhappier if things are going according to his plan!
116|The more you keep thinking that way, the more you'll corner yourself.
116|First of all, Araragi-kun is suffering right now because he's thinking of you.
116|That just makes me feel refreshed.
116|That's refreshing?
116|I don't think any kind of happiness suits you.
116|Still, when I think of the way Hanekawa-san and the creepy girl here
116|were providing hints, it feels like they were intentionally cornering him.
116|A Hint Rush, huh?
116|Hint 15. Hint 16. Hint 17. Hint 18.
116|They're in sync, even though I thought they didn't get along.
116|Joining forces in the face of a common enemy, huh? That's touching.
116|What's touching about it?
116|I don't know how Ougi-san feels, but Araragi-kun definitely isn't an enemy to Hanekawa-san.
116|You sure about that?
116|I'll bet Araragi has constantly put Hanekawa-san into awful situations.
116|That's a bold assertion. Granted, you're pretty close to the mark.
116|Ever since she got to know him during Spring Break, her life has taken a dramatic turn.
116|She made her bed, now she'll lie in it!
116|She made her bed? Not a very modern expression, don't you think?
116|Hey, we should form a victim's association!
116|Since I was the founder, I can be the chairman if you'd like!
116|Even if you're the chairman, they'll just overthrow you.
116|Don't say that.
116|Being overthrown isn't a skill of mine.
116|It's hard to say.
116|I mean, a victim's association already exists, kind of.
116|The trouble is, the victim's association
116|is officially dubbed the "Araragi Harem."
116|"Araragi Harem?"
116|That's a thing?
116|If you're that excited, I can write you a recommendation. Want in?
116|Hell no! What kind of creepy organization is that?
116|Wanna be chairman?
116|I immediately resign.
116|That organization might not be as uncomfortable as you might think.
116|Most of the members of the Araragi Harem have some kind of grudge against him.
116|While I find the existence of this "Araragi Harem" to be questionable,
116|how does it have anything to do with victims?
116|Wait, I never saw it from this perspective,
116|but is Araragi popular with girls?
116|Hard to say.
116|There may be characters in the Monogatari Series aside from myself who have also been dubbed "heroines,"
116|but almost all of them have nearly killed him at least once.
116|It sounds more like Araragi's the victim in this case.
116|Wait, you too?
116|I wasn't among them.
116|I have kidnapped him, though.
116|That's more than enough.
116|What's with you people?
116|Even if that weren't the case, I'd still never join an organization named after him.
116|Then would you like to join the "Senjougahara Harem?"
116|That's a thing too?
116|Have harems started popping up like daisies at Naoetsu ever since I became a shut-in?
116|That's disgusting.
116|Well, it might be true that Hanekawa-san's life changed greatly after Spring Break,
116|but if you asked me if her life prior to that was better,
116|I'd have to answer "no."
116|I see.
116|Can you say the same about your life?
116|I suppose so.
116|But now that we're on that topic,
116|wouldn't you be a completely different person had you never met Araragi-kun?
116|I'm not sure about that.
116|I think I'm the kind of person who never changed despite meeting him—
116|Your laughter needs to work on its timing.
116|In truth, even if I say that Araragi was the one who ruined my life,
116|what really happened was that he failed to act.
116|It's my fault. My fault.
116|I hate myself. I hate myself so much.
116|It's hard to tiptoe through this conversation when I can't figure out what triggers your depression.
116|Be that as it may, I haven't seen you try and tiptoe at all.
116|But still, wouldn't you prefer to have someone who says what they think to your face, instead of being diplomatic?
116|That's not how I'd interpret it.
116|Stop putting yourself in a good light.
116|People would obviously get hurt if you were always honest.
116|It's so nice to have someone you can say whatever you want to.
116|Assuming you want to say nice things, that is.
116|I'd rather not hear the honest thoughts of a scumbag.
116|Since I've been straight with you, I think it's your turn to reciprocate.
116|You actually love me a lot, right?
116|Not in the slightest.
116|I already hate you considerably because you're dating Araragi,
116|so ignoring this commentary, what part of you should I find likable?
116|Haven't you fallen for these twintails?
116|You only got those a second ago!
116|And they were mine to begin with!
116|Hurry up and give my hair ties back.
116|I'm glad I was able to give something back to you, even if it's these hair ties.
116|Shut up. Give them back, now.
116|Alright already. They've caught a bit of my hair, but please don't mind.
116|Gross; don't hand it back to me like that.
116|Of course I'd mind! Take the hair off before you return it!
116|I thought you'd want me to pay interest when I returned it.
116|Do you really think I'd consider your hair to be "interest?"
116|Just a sec. Let me redo my hair.
116|All right.
116|Take five; we're waiting for Oikura-san to fix her hair!
116|We don't need to go on break!
116|Oikura-san's preparations are complete.
116|We will now begin Part B.
116|Stop making a big deal out of my twintails.
116|That break wasn't unusually long.
116|Put aside your usual antics and look at this.
116|Getting angry isn't one of my "usual antics."
116|It's the Araragi household.
116|Karen-san and Tsukihi-san.
116|Feeling nostalgic?
116|Like I said, I hate it all.
116|Seeing it brings nothing but painful memories.
116|Koyomi, Karen, or Tsukihi; I hate all the Araragi siblings!
116|Kya! Aww, Oikura-chan, you just called Araragi-kun "Koyomi."
116|Just as a childhood friend would.
116|T/N: "Takumi" can be read as 巧み (skill) or 匠 (artisan).
116|How are you so good at finding those "gotcha moments?"
116|You're so skilled, it's almost like an art form.
116|Also, you just called me "Oikura-chan."
116|I thought I'd be able to take advantage of the confusion.
116|But let's assume that your dislike of Araragi-kun and Tsukihi-san are understandable.
116|You hate Karen-san too?
116|Yeah, well...
116|It's less hate and more like we didn't mesh well.
116|Your personalities?
116|To be fair, nobody with a personality that meshes well with yours has been born in the last millennium.
116|You're exaggerating way too much.
116|I mean, I do agree with that, but
116|she was the outdoorsy type in elementary school,
116|she was always out and about, so I never really interacted with her.
116|Hmm?
116|Well, the fact that she's Araragi's sister is enough for me to hate her, right?
116|"Right?" Don't act cheery when you say that.
116|Stop hating people so cheerfully.
116|So when you and Araragi-kun were having your conversation, what kinds of stuff did you talk about?
116|Did you look back on old times?
116|Interested, are we?
116|Well at that point, a huge burden had been lifted off me, so I let down my guard.
116|Did that burden involve your mother, and the fact that they decided you were moving out?
116|Of course, you probably had an inkling about both of those things.
116|Yeah.
116|To be completely honest, it took a huge load off my back.
116|It might be better to say that it felt like I had been freed from a demon.
116|Let's put the matter of how Araragi-kun revealed the truth aside.
116|What I want to know about is how great the person from town hall must be.
116|After all, they were able to deliver the news to the likes of you.
116|In fact, that means that this person's been dealing with you ever since your mother passed away, right?
116|Yeah. They even ironed out all the details for my next move.
116|I'm not trying to say that your life's gotten better,
116|but it's nice that you've gotten involved with a good adult for once.
116|The person I got involved with was a con man, you know.
116|Is that the con man the one who you said wasn't allowed to do commentary?
116|Looks like quite a bit's happened to you since the class trial too.
116|We did have to clarify that it wasn't just the face-to-face conversation with Araragi-kun
116|that finally put you at ease.
116|Maybe the moral of the story is that I needed to rely on an adult.
116|Both my past and my present selves.
116|Don't forget that adults were the ones who put us into our respective messes as well.
116|With that said, we need to start wrapping things up soon.
116|Oikura-san.
116|This is your last chance to reveal the letter's contents.
116|Like I said, not gonna happen.
116|It's a riddle story.
116|You say that, but I bet you'll string me along until the very end,
116|and then reveal the surprise.
116|What makes you think I'd have a surprise for you?
116|Do you think we get along so well that I'd do that?
116|What? But I have one for you.
116|We'll have saffron rice when this is over.
116|I don't want your cooking.
116|Besides, I know you're lying.
116|That's right. The part about the saffron rice was a lie.
116|Same with the surprise, right?
116|Nope. As it turns out, I arranged to have Araragi-kun
116|show up at the studio after the recording.
116|Surprise!
116|I'll kill you!
116|You're able to use my catchphrase more terrifyingly than I can.
116|Nicely done.
116|What the hell have you done?
116|What? You're lying, right?
116|It's all a joke, right?
116|You didn't actually call Araragi to the recording studio, right?
116|It's true that I sent Araragi-kun an e-mail during our little break when you were redoing your twintails.
116|I'm asking about what the e-mail said!
116|Hmm. What do you think it said?
116|Don't pose it like a question! This isn't a riddle story!
116|In that case, you must've taken my hair ties in anticipation of this.
116|In anticipation of telling Araragi about when we'd be done recording?
116|Took you long enough.
116|Did you think I'd wear twintails just for fun?
116|"Took you long enough." Are you kidding?
116|Did you really think I'd be interested in your hairstyle; one of the most pointless topics in the world?
116|It was obviously part of my plan to surprise you.
116|And this was as equally pointless as that hairstyle, so you didn't need to prepare a surprise!
116|Wait, really?
116|Araragi's coming?
116|He's not, right?
116|Even if you really did send that e-mail, he'd never actually come to meet me, right?
116|I don't know about that.
116|I may have written that you totally wanted to make out with him.
116|He definitely wouldn't come!
116|Why don't you stay on make-out duty, Ms. "Addicted to Your Kiss?"
116|I remember sending that e-mail too.
116|My, Oikura-san. Don't go looking through other people's mail.
116|That part was broadcast.
116|I'm also aware of how you told Araragi about how I apologized,
116|namely how you "forgave me." How high and mighty of you.
116|While I do find that e-mail to be questionable,
116|what I'm currently referring to is the e-mail you sent out a few minutes ago.
116|The person who'll actually show up will be someone like Hanekawa-san, right?
116|Hanekawa-san is currently overseas.
116|Maybe it's Tetsujou-sensei.
116|You must really want this recording booth to become a murder scene.
116|Come now. You may have had your differences,
116|but that's all in the past, and there's no point in staying angry about it.
116|Why don't you both act like adults and try to talk it out?
116|Stop trying to make peace
116|between Tetsujou and me, or Araragi and me.
116|T/N: 仲裁 (chuusai: mediate/make peace) and ベロチュー (berochuu: make out) both have "chuu" in them.
116|"Make out." "Make peace."
116|You have something against the word "make?"
116|There aren't that many expressions like that!
116|In fact, I'd rather you "make" that surprise go away.
116|I think we can "make" that a good middle ground.
116|Okay, okay. Fine.
116|I'll make it go away.
116|I'll make it stop.
116|There. Sent.
116|Was that so hard?
116|So, what do you think the e-mail said?
116|Didn't you make it all go away?
116|If you'd like to know what I wrote, then tell me what you wrote in that letter.
116|I gain nothing from that trade.
116|I've made up my mind. I'm never telling you.
116|It seemed like you really wanted to know,
116|so I thought I might quietly reveal what I wrote after the recording,
116|but I'll never tell you.
116|T/N: 捗々しい (hakabakashii) contains "haka," which can be read as "grave."
116|I'll take it to my grave.
116|This situation seems grave.
116|But I'm the type of woman who would dig up that grave.
116|You're really scaring me.
116|I suppose the best answer comes from Araragi-kun's thoughts at the end of the episode.
116|Were they math questions or unbefitting words of gratitude?
116|Strings of abuse, perhaps?
116|Maybe even all of the above?
116|No comment.
116|Some might even think it's a love confession.
116|There's no way in hell!
116|...Is what I'd like to say,
116|but it's a riddle story, so I'm not going to eliminate that possibility.
116|You might be the first person since Hanekawa-san to take their commentary duties so seriously.
116|There's also the possibility that while the envelope wasn't empty, the paper was blank.
116|That's a creepy laugh.
116|Well I guess Araragi-kun would have no choice but to laugh if it was blank.
116|It's just that I've heard all kinds of interesting theories through my research.
116|I've even seen several shockingly deep answers that may very well be the right answer.
116|Not that you'd write anything deep, mind you.
116|My "depth" aside, I'm curious.
116|What kind of answers?
116|Hmm. What kind do you think they were?
116|This is the ending.
116|And the opening of the surprise party.
116|Don't announce that so loudly.
116|Gimme your phone.
116|I'll send the cancellation e-mail.
116|*Snap*
116|Oh, sorry. I accidentally broke my SIM card.
116|If you were serious enough to break your SIM card, then you definitely called Araragi here!
116|It's not a riddle anymore.
116|Well, I doubt anything you wrote would've compelled him to come here.
116|What if I wrote that you had me confined here?
116|Then he'd definitely come!
116|How could you lie so shamelessly?
116|I'm not lying, though.
116|You said that nobody could leave this booth until the commentary had been recorded.
116|Damn it! You used my immaturity against me!
116|There really wasn't any upside to saying that.
116|Huh? Then what do I do?
116|How can I get out of this mess?
116|People can only save themselves, Oikura-chan.
116|If you call me "Oikura-chan" again, I'll murder you for real.
116|Well in any case, my plan to make you funny seems to have worked,
116|even if you were gloominess personified before all this.
116|THAT'S what you were planning?
116|Well...
116|Thanks.
116|I never thought you'd thank me sincerely.
116|Seriously though, you really helped me out.
116|You and the other two did.
116|And that statement is the biggest suprise of all.
116|Well then, this commentary has been brought to you by Senjougahara "Who Cares if Something Good Happened to My Partner" Hitagi,
116|And Oikura "I'd Hate it Even if Something Good Happened" Sodachi.
117|Before the finale begins, before we reach the end,
117|I'm sure you, my dear readers, have not forgotten
117|that there is a story left that I must disclose to you.
117|Frankly, I would have wanted you to forget,
117|and even more so, would have wanted to forget it myself.
117|Keeping it undisclosed, secretly and sorrowfully pretending it had never happened, I would've liked to end this story about me.
117|You won't get away so easily, Araragi.
117|Trying to hide something from me is foolish.
117|I am the nemesis of lies and deception.
117|I am the predator of delay and postponement.
117|You should be aware of what befell Kaiki Deishuu, the great fraud.
117|If you don't wish to end up like him, please tell your story.
117|Tell the story you've been so adamant to keep hidden until now.

117|I could tell from looking at her that she already knew exactly of the events being referred to,
117|but had I confronted her with such a suspicion, she simply would have feigned ignorance.
117|I know nothing.
117|You're the one who knows.
117|She is right.
117|I know.
117|I know very well what happened.
117|And precisely because I know, I wished to hide it.
117|And likewise because I know, I have to tell it.
117|This story will take a while, I said.
117|I don't mind.
117|This story describes les événements of more than two months prior to Ougi transferring into our school.
117|Summer break was over, and the second term had just begun.
117|Emergency Button
117|His link to the vampire had been severed,
117|Naoetsu Private High School
117|and for the first time in about half a year, Araragi Koyomi experienced being more or less human again.
117|He didn't go to school.
117|He didn't go home.
117|He was hiding in one of the classrooms in the decrepit cram school that the specialist Oshino Meme had used
117|to sleep in as though he had all the time in the world.
117|Tonight, 9:00 O'clock Alone, Second Floor Come To The Classroom There's something I want to ask you
117|Here the story begins,
117|and here the story ends
117|together with the life of another.
117|The life of one that time had tested in vain.
117|End Story
117|Shinobu Mail
117|End Story
117|Shinobu Mail Part One
117|Araragi!
117|Long time no see!
117|Long time no knee!
117|Having already screamed, I only wished it had been more chic.
117|Screaming like a frog run over by a car is not particularly cool.
117|Well, perhaps it's out of line to hope for a cool way of getting kneed in the face.
117|Nice one, Araragi.
117|Immediately making a pun on getting kneed in times of need is impressive.
117|This round goes to you.
117|However, Araragi.
117|Permit me to say this, but I prefer the word patella over the word kneecap.
117|It's just one letter away from paella, and thinking something hot and Spanish is inside me makes me happy.
117|You insult the word happiness.
117|Why must you make it so dirty?
117|Better yet would be knee chaps instead of kneecaps.
117|Doesn't the world seem richer if you think everyone has two little boys inside them?
117|You insult the word rich!
117|I don't have little boys inside me!
117|Anyway.
117|My main criticism should probably be that you haven't apologized for kicking your senior.
117|Apologize?
117|Don't be silly.
117|Is my loyalty not such that I should be considered a part of your body?
117|Who would apologize to themselves for resting their cheek on their own knee?
117|That only sounds smart until you actually think about it!
117|To be honest, I know that you regenerate very quickly,
117|so I felt that a near-miss like that was no big deal.
117|Honesty doesn't excuse everything!
117|Look, you knocked out a tooth...
117|What's wrong, Araragi?
117|You seem interested in my proportions.
117|I wasn't checking out your proportions.
117|What?
117|If you weren't checking them out, why else would you look at me?
117|Is that not the best thing about me?
117|Stop with the sudden humility! You're Naoetsu High School's best athlete.
117|You don't have to look at me with such concern, Araragi.
117|Concern?
117|Is there something I should be concerned about?
117|Don't play dumb.
117|You're such a gentleman, Araragi.
117|But don't worry. You can trust your junior some more.
117|No worries.
117|I left the bra home.
117|Now I'm starting to be concerned!
117|My hoodie is rather thick, so you probably can't tell by looking at me,
117|but I wouldn't lie to you, Araragi!
117|I'm wearing this hoodie over bare skin.
117|And what about the lower half?
117|I'm worried.
117|Huh?
117|But, I mean... Calling me out to this place, at this hour, can only mean one thing, right?
117|One thing?
117|What thing?
117|I thought you had finally decided to take my virginity.
117|Of course not!
117|Tonight, 9:00 O'clock Alone, Second Floor Come To The Classroom There's something I want to ask you
117|Look, Araragi.
117|Asking a girl—a woman—to come alone, at night, to a place away from prying eyes using a suggestive text
117|Beware
117|Danger
117|cannot be taken many different ways.
117|Alone, Second Come To
117|Besides, Araragi.
117|I accidentally went to the third floor out of excitement when I got here,
117|and there was a bed on one of the tables.
117|Didn't you put it there?
117|What? No, I really have no idea.
117|A bed?
117|You always play dumb.
117|Always, huh? I'm not really that type of character.
117|We can call it a fait accompli marriage, and you could enjoy my virginity right here and now.
117|I told you I won't.
117|What's a fait accompli marriage, anyway?
117|If anything, it's fait inaccompli
117|Back to the subject!
117|So, about why I asked you to come here.
117|Tonight, 9:00 O'clock Alone, Second Floor Come To The Classroom There's something I want to ask you
117|You wanted to ask me something, if I remember correctly.
117|Yeah.
117|I was thoroughly convinced that your questions concerned my virginity, but I guess I jumped the gun.
117|You did, and I hope you won't be jumping any guns for a while longer.
117|I'd never ask you about that.
117|What I want to ask you about is...
117|Well, I want you to help me with something.
117|I want to ask you whether you'll help me.
117|To be honest, I'd rather you refused me.
117|Of course I accept!
117|How could I, Kanbaru Suruga, ever refuse your requests, Araragi?
117|Pigs would sooner fly through a frozen hell!
117|You see, it's not really my own request.
117|I'm just the intermediary.
117|Besides, I don't really know myself what you'd be helping with.
117|You don't know?
117|No, not at all.
117|I was probably never told on purpose.
117|So if you refused me here, that would be the end of it.
117|I would prefer that.
117|Of course, should you decide to help, I would do my utmost to protect your body from injury.
117|You don't have to worry about my body.
117|If you want to ponder my body,
117|then you're welcome to ponder the volume of my breasts.
117|The hell I will!
117|That I have come running to this cram school against all odds should be enough answer for you, Araragi.
117|Uh, I guess.
117|I was overwhelmed by the desire to serve your every need.
117|There was a book I wanted to read this evening,
117|but I came here just for you.
117|A book you wanted to read?
117|I'm competing with a book now?
117|So, Kanbaru.
117|What did you want to read tonight?
117|Something by Yamamoto Shuugorou of course!
117|Which one by him?
117|If you like it, I want to read it too.
117|Oh, if that's the case, I have some boy love novels to recommend!
117|Let's start with Yamamoto Shuugorou.
117|Okay. Let's see.
117|It's called "First at the Maiden."
117|Liar!
117|As if the renowned Yamamoto Shuugorou would choose a title like that!
117|But it really exists... What are you going to do?
117|I guess it's actually out of print with no second edition in sight, though.
117|Back to the subject!
117|All right, Kanbaru.
117|What I was going to ask you...
117|I'm sorry to spring this on you, but would you come with me?
117|Huh?
117|I thought everything was going to go down here.
117|No, I only meant to meet you here.
117|So... Why didn't we meet at home, then?
117|Huh? Why did I make this our meeting point, anyway?
117|I think...
117|Well, I don't mind.
117|I won't pry.
117|Let's go wherever you want.
117|I'll be fine.
117|I wrote my will.
117|That's depressing!
117|You don't have to get so worked up, Kanbaru.
117|We're just heading to a different meeting point now.
117|A rendezvous point...
117|Basically, I want to introduce you to someone.
117|Oh my, look at you.
117|Whom did you try to impress and how?
117|With grades? Contacts? Popularity?
117|No. I don't want you to back up my story.
117|I just want you to meet someone.
117|They said they wanted to meet you.
117|All righty.
117|I'm sure what you say is all fine.
117|I feel like you'd be better off trusting me about half as much as you do.
117|But don't worry.
117|What I know for sure is that some boy or girl won't confess their love for you this evening.
117|I wouldn't mind that, anyway.
117|I'd just turn them down.
117|If you go and say, "Alas, it was me!" then of course things are different.
117|Don't try to seize every opportunity to go out with me.
117|How can you be so hell-bent on carnal relations?
117|But I don't want to go out with you.
117|Just the carnal part is enough.
117|A carnal carnivore needs their catch.
117|I'm getting goose bumps.
117|I don't believe in emotional attachment!
117|What on Earth happened in your life?
117|And by what do you live it?
117|If it looks to you like I think about life, you should see an optometrist.
117|Back to the subject!
117|Okey-dokey, Araragi.
117|I have grasped the details.
117|Let us venture forth.
117|Let us go to meet someone I don't know somewhere I don't know!
117|You can be pretty amazing.
117|Deleaveture!
117|Huh? Who's that? Another visitor?
117|Come in!
117|Isn't that some acquaintance of yours?
117|I thought you had called someone else here beside me.
117|No, I only called you...
117|K-Kanbaru—
117|Take cover, Araragi!
117|Empty
117|Araragi, this isn't just empty... It's an empty shell.
117|Shell
117|There was no resistance at all.
117|I felt like I hit the empty air.
117|What is that?
117|A friend of yours?
117|None of my friends is a suit of armor.
117|Then what sort of friends do you have?
117|Huh?
117|Well, well...
117|What's wrong, Kanbaru?
117|Oh, I just... thought it was a full suit of armor, but now that I look at it carefully, it's missing something.
117|Missing?
117|Yeah. You see, we have five or six suits of armor at home too,
117|and compared to them, I feel like this one is missing something vital.
117|To me it didn't seem like something was missing.
117|Oh, Kanbaru.
117|Since you have such intimate knowledge of armor sets, could you assemble it again?
117|What, me?
117|Well, I don't know how to assemble it.
117|How about I tell you what to do and you do it?
117|You know no hesitation when it comes to using your senior, huh?
117|Well, all right.
117|I will demonstrate to you that I can do more than lie on the floor and shield my head!
117|I can also look up!
117|I don't really want the person I respect to look up at me.
117|But why do you want to have it assembled anyway?
117|Look, maybe it moves again if we reassemble it.
117|What this armor lacks
117|is...
117|Stand back, Araragi!
117|Kanbaru!
117|Stay there!
117|Isn't he
117|getting tougher?
117|A—
117|Araragi...
117|Run away.
117|That was the one order I could not obey.
117|The armor became gradually tougher.
117|And, conversely, I hadn't realized Kanbaru became gradually weaker.
117|Her first punch struck his torso.
117|Another punch struck his chin,
117|and she went down to one knee afterwards.
117|I thought it strange that she lost strength there,
117|but I only understood once I saw her drop to the ground right after her tackle.
117|Energy drain.
117|Energy Drain
117|Why?
117|Why does this old, anachronistic armor use the energy drain of vampires?
117|What is that?
117|What's wrong with you?
117|Why are you here?
117|What do you have against us?
117|Why are you doing this?
117|Stay away.
117|If you can move, run away now.
117|I'll come from behind
117|and hit his knees,
117|so use that chance
117|to run away.
117|Even your eye contact is silly.
117|Hanekawa...
117|Perhaps I should take my leave here.
117|It appears I have been met with serious interference.
117|Did I step on the tiger's tail?
117|I stand no chance as I am now.
117|I see this was not my chance after all.
117|My master is not here either.
117|I shall return!
117|You will go home now without detours.
117|When the armor wrangled my head, it took my voice.
117|Energy drain.
117|Just as it recreated Kanbaru's tackle,
117|it recreated my voice.
117|If you see Kiss-Shot, tell her...
117|that I will collect my treasured demon sword, Heart Span, once I have recovered.
117|What is a samurai without his sword?
117|It has been four hundred years since I lent it to her.
117|Tell her to prepare for a late fee!
117|What was that warrior, Araragi?
117|I thought it was strange that no sword accompanied the armor, but...
117|He mentioned the demon sword, Heart Span, and Kiss-Shot...
117|Let's worry about that later.
117|Hey, Kanbaru...
117|Can you jump up to the ceiling from here?
117|Then climb up?
117|Then you can take the elevator shaft down to the first floor—
117|You overestimate me, Araragi.
117|I'm not that athletic.
117|Not even I can jump to the ceiling carrying a larger boy.
117|I see.
117|Araragi.
117|Yes, Kanbaru?
117|Will you sleep with me?
117|Don't put yourself into the mood!
117|I don't want to die a virgin!
117|This isn't the time for confessions!
117|Because you always say stuff like that
117|the story you narrated was on the backburner.
117|Oh, well.
117|This isn't such a bad way to die.
117|Dying together with you is all I wish for.
117|Uh, sorry.
117|I don't feel the same way about you.
117|Ouch. That hurts.
117|There is only one person I want to die together with.
117|The blonde oddity.
117|And she isn't here right now.
117|Therefore we must escape this blazing building.
117|All right.
117|Guess it's time to man up.
117|To do to me what only a man can?
117|I couldn't bring myself to do that.
117|We can still jump out of a window as a last-ditch effort.
117|Yeah.
117|I also thought that was our last choice.
117|Liar
117|You were thinking about something completely different.
117|Don't get this wrong, Araragi. The first step is with the right foot.
117|But since I'm left-handed, I sometimes confuse left and right.
117|This is called Dynamite Firefighting, I believe.
117|Don't think you're dying here.
117|If anything will kill you, it'll be me.
117|I hear your laughter near me
117|You were supposed to be there forever
117|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
117|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
117|I heard your voice from the hallway
117|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
117|At some point I became unable
117|to talk to you normally
117|I can hear your laughter a ways away
117|You were supposed to be next to me forever
117|You knew how I felt
117|even when I said nothing
117|Now I know how important you were to me,
117|but we will never see each other again
118|Before the finale begins, before we reach the end,
118|I'm sure you, my dear readers, have not forgotten
118|that there is a story left that I must disclose to you.
118|Frankly, I would have wanted you to forget,
118|and even more so, would have wanted to forget it myself.
118|Keeping it undisclosed, secretly and sorrowfully, pretending it had never happened, I would've liked to end this story about me.
118|You won't get away so easily, Araragi-senpai.
118|Trying to hide something from me is foolish.
118|I am the nemesis of lies and deception.
118|I am the predator of delay and postponement.
118|You should be aware of what befell Kaiki Deishuu, the great fraud.
118|If you don't wish to end up like him, please tell your story.
118|Tell the story you've been so adamant about hiding until now.
118|I could tell from looking at her that she already knew all about the events being referred to,
118|12
118|1
118|2
118|3
118|4
118|5
118|6
118|7
118|8
118|9
118|10
118|11
118|but had I confronted her with such a suspicion, she would have simply feigned ignorance.
118|I know nothing.
118|You're the one who knows, Araragi-senpai.
118|She is right.
118|I know.
118|I know very well what happened.
118|And precisely because I know, I wished to hide it.
118|And likewise, because I know, I have to tell it.
118|This story will take a while, I said.
118|That's not an issue.
118|This story describes les événements of more than two months prior to Oshino Ougi transferring into our school.
118|Summer break was over and the second term had just begun.
118|Emergency Button
118|His link to the vampire had been severed,
118|Naoetsu Private High School
118|and for the first time in about half a year, Araragi Koyomi experienced being more or less human again.
118|He didn't go to school.
118|He didn't go home.
118|He was hiding in one of the classrooms in the decrepit cram school that the specialist Oshino Meme had used
118|to sleep in as though he had all the time in the world.
118|Tonight, 9:00 O'clock Alone, Second Floor Come To The Classroom There's something I want to ask you
118|Here the story begins,
118|and here the story ends
118|together with the life of another.
118|The life of one that time had tested in vain.
118|Du bist alles
118|You are everything
118|Ich kann dich hören
118|I can hear you
118|rufe meinen Namen
118|call my name
118|und wieder und wieder
118|and again and again
118|Ich kann dich hören
118|I can hear you
118|für immer und ewig
118|forever and ever
118|mein Schatz
118|my treasure
118|Owarimonogatari
118|Shinobu Mail Part One
118|Araragi-senpai!
118|Long time—!
118|Long time no knee!
118|Having already screamed, I only wished it had been more chic.
118|Screaming like a frog run over by a car is not particularly cool.
118|Well, perhaps it's out of line to hope for a cool way of getting kneed in the face.
118|Nice one, Araragi-senpai.
118|Immediately making a pun on getting kneed in times of need is impressive.
118|This round goes to you.
118|However, Araragi-senpai.
118|Permit me to say this, but I prefer the word "patella" over the word "kneecap."
118|It's just one letter away from "paella," and thinking that something hot and Spanish is inside me makes me happy.
118|You insult the word "happiness."
118|Why must you make it so dirty?
118|Better yet would be "knee chaps" instead of "kneecaps."
118|Doesn't the world seem richer if you think everyone has two little boys inside them?
118|You insult the word "rich"!
118|I don't have little boys inside me!
118|Anyway.
118|My main criticism should probably be that you haven't apologized for kicking your senpai.
118|Apologize?
118|Don't be silly.
118|Is my loyalty not such that I, your underclassman Kanbaru Suruga,
118|should be considered a part of your body, Araragi-senpai?
118|Who would apologize to themselves for resting their cheek on their own knee?
118|That only sounds smart until you actually think about it!
118|To be honest, Araragi-senpai, I know that you regenerate very quickly,
118|so I felt that a near-hit like that was no big deal.
118|Honesty doesn't excuse everything!
118|Look, you knocked out a tooth...
118|What's wrong, Araragi-senpai?
118|You seem interested in my proportions.
118|I wasn't checking out your proportions.
118|What?
118|If you weren't checking out my proportions, why else would you look at me?
118|Are my proportions not the best thing about me?
118|Stop with the sudden humility! You're Naoetsu High School's best athlete.
118|You don't have to look at me with such concern, Araragi-senpai.
118|Concern?
118|Is there something I should be concerned about?
118|Don't play dumb.
118|You're such a gentleman, Araragi-senpai.
118|But don't worry. You can trust your underclassman some more.
118|No worries.
118|I left the bra at home.
118|Now I'm starting to be concerned!
118|My hoodie is rather thick, so you probably can't tell by looking at me,
118|but I, Kanbaru Suruga wouldn't lie to you, Araragi-senpai!
118|I'm wearing this hoodie over bare skin.
118|And what about the lower half?
118|I'm worried.
118|Huh?
118|But, I mean... Calling me out to this place, at this hour, can only mean one thing, right?
118|One thing?
118|What thing?
118|Araragi-senpai, I thought you had finally decided to take my virginity.
118|Of course not!
118|Tonight, 9:00 O'clock Alone, Second Floor Come To The Classroom There's something I want to ask you
118|Look, Araragi-senpai.
118|Asking a girl—a woman—to come alone, at night, to a place away from prying eyes using a suggestive text
118|Beware
118|Danger
118|cannot be taken many different ways.
118|Alone, Second Come To
118|Besides, Araragi-senpai.
118|I accidentally went to the third floor out of excitement when I got here,
118|and there was a bed on one of the tables.
118|Araragi-senpai, didn't you put it there?
118|What? No, I really have no idea.
118|A bed?
118|You always play dumb.
118|Always, huh? I'm not really that type of character.
118|We can call it a fait accompli marriage, Araragi-senpai, and you could enjoy my virginity right here and now.
118|I told you that I won't.
118|What's a fait accompli marriage, anyway?
118|If anything, it's fait inaccompli
118|Back to the subject!
118|So, about why I asked you to come here.
118|Tonight, 9:00 O'clock Alone, Second Floor Come To The Classroom There's something I want to ask you
118|You wanted to ask me something, if I remember correctly.
118|Yeah.
118|I was thoroughly convinced that your questions concerned my virginity, but I guess I jumped the gun.
118|You did, and I hope you won't be jumping any guns for a while longer.
118|I'd never ask you about that.
118|What I want to ask you about is...
118|Well, I want you to help me with something.
118|I want to ask you whether you'll help me.
118|To be honest, I'd rather you refuse me.
118|Of course I wouldn't refuse!
118|How could I, Kanbaru Suruga, ever refuse one of Araragi-senpai's requests?
118|Pigs would sooner fly through a frozen hell!
118|You see, it's not really my own request.
118|I'm just the intermediary.
118|Besides, I don't really know myself what you'd be helping with.
118|You don't know?
118|No, not at all.
118|I was probably never told on purpose.
118|So if you refused me here, that would be the end of it.
118|I would prefer that.
118|Of course, should you decide to help, I would do my utmost to protect your body from injury.
118|You don't have to worry about my body.
118|If you want to ponder my body,
118|then you're welcome to ponder the volume of my breasts.
118|The hell I will!
118|Araragi-senpai, that I have come running to this cram school against all odds should be answer enough for you.
118|Uh, I guess.
118|Araragi-senpai, I was overwhelmed by the desire to serve your every need.
118|There was a book I wanted to read this evening, Araragi-senpai,
118|but I came here just for you.
118|A book you wanted to read?
118|I'm competing with a book?
118|So, Kanbaru.
118|What did you want to read tonight?
118|Something by Yamamoto Shuugorou-sensei, of course!
118|Which one of Yamamoto Shuugorou's works?
118|If you like it, I want to read it, too.
118|Oh, if that's the case, I have some Boys' Love novels to recommend!
118|Let's start with Yamamoto Shuugorou.
118|Okay. Let's see.
118|It's called "First at the Maiden."
118|Liar!
118|As if the renowned Yamamoto Shuugorou-sensei would choose a title like that!
118|But it really exists... What are you going to do?
118|I guess it's actually out of print with no second edition in sight, though.
118|Back to the subject!
118|All right, Kanbaru.
118|What I was going to ask you...
118|I'm sorry to spring this on you, but would you come with me?
118|Huh?
118|I thought everything was going to go down here.
118|No, I only meant to meet you here.
118|So... Why didn't we meet at home, then?
118|Huh? Why did I make this our meeting point, anyway?
118|I think...
118|Well, I don't mind.
118|I won't pry.
118|Let's go wherever you want.
118|I'll be fine.
118|I wrote my will.
118|That's depressing!
118|You don't have to get so worked up, Kanbaru.
118|We're just heading to a different meeting point now.
118|A rendezvous point...
118|Basically, I want to introduce you to someone.
118|Oh, my, look at you.
118|Whom did you try to impress and how?
118|With grades? Contacts? Popularity?
118|No. I don't want you to back up my story.
118|I just want you to meet someone.
118|They said they wanted to meet you.
118|All righty.
118|Araragi-senpai, I'm sure what you say is all well and good.
118|I feel like you'd be better off trusting me about half as much as you do.
118|But don't worry.
118|What I know for sure is that some boy or girl won't confess their love for you this evening.
118|I wouldn't mind that, anyway.
118|I'd just turn them down.
118|If you go and say, "Alas, it was me!," then of course things are different.
118|Don't try to seize every opportunity to go out with me.
118|How can you be so hell-bent on carnal relations?
118|But I don't want to go out with you.
118|Just the carnal part is enough.
118|A carnal carnivore needs their catch.
118|I'm getting goosebumps.
118|I don't believe in emotional attachment!
118|What on Earth happened in your life?
118|And by what do you live it?
118|If it looks to you like I think about life, you should see an optometrist.
118|Back to the subject!
118|Okey-dokey, Araragi-senpai.
118|I have grasped the details.
118|Let us venture forth.
118|Let us go to meet someone I don't know somewhere I don't know!
118|You can be pretty amazing.
118|Deleaveture!
118|Huh? Who's that? Another visitor?
118|Come in!
118|Araragi-senpai, isn't that some acquaintance of yours?
118|I thought you had called someone else here beside me.
118|No, I only called you...
118|K-Kanbaru—
118|Araragi-senpai, take cover!
118|Empty
118|Araragi-senpai, this isn't just empty... It's an empty shell.
118|Shell
118|There was no resistance at all.
118|It felt like I hit the empty air.
118|What is that?
118|A friend of yours, Araragi-senpai?
118|None of my friends are a suit of armor.
118|Then what sort of friends do you have?
118|Huh?
118|Well, well...
118|What's wrong, Kanbaru?
118|Oh, I just... thought it was a full suit of armor, but now that I look at it carefully, it's missing something.
118|Missing?
118|Yeah. You see, we have five or six suits of armor at home, too,
118|and compared to them, I feel that this one is missing something vital.
118|To me, it didn't seem like something was missing.
118|Oh, Kanbaru.
118|Because you have such intimate knowledge of armor sets, could you assemble it again?
118|What, me?
118|Well, I don't know how to assemble it.
118|How about I tell you what to do, Araragi-senpai, and you do it?
118|You know no hesitation when it comes to using your senpai, huh?
118|Well, all right.
118|I will demonstrate to you that I can do more than lie on the floor and shield my head!
118|I can also look up!
118|I don't really want the person I respect to look up at me.
118|But why do you want to have it assembled, anyway?
118|Look, maybe it'll move again if we reassemble it.
118|What this armor lacks
118|is...
118|Stand back, Araragi-senpai!
118|Kanbaru!
118|Stay there!
118|Isn't he
118|getting tougher?
118|A—
118|Araragi-senpai...
118|Run away.
118|That was the one order I could not obey.
118|The armor became gradually tougher.
118|And, conversely, I hadn't realized that Kanbaru became gradually weaker.
118|Her first punch struck his torso.
118|Another punch struck his chin,
118|and she went down to one knee afterwards.
118|I thought it strange that she lost strength there,
118|but I only understood once I saw her drop to the ground right after her tackle.
118|Energy drain.
118|Energy Drain
118|Why?
118|Why does this old, anachronistic armor use the energy drain of vampires?
118|What is that?
118|What's wrong with you?
118|Why are you here?
118|What do you have against us?
118|Why are you doing this?
118|Stay away.
118|If you can move, run away now.
118|I'll come from behind
118|and hit his knees,
118|so use that chance
118|to run away.
118|Even your eye contact is silly.
118|Hanekawa-senpai...
118|Perhaps I should take my leave here.
118|It appears I have been met with serious interference.
118|Did I step on the tiger's tail?
118|I stand no chance as I am now.
118|I see this was not my chance after all.
118|My master is not here, either.
118|I shall return!
118|You will now go home without taking any detours.
118|When the armor wrangled my head, it took my voice.
118|Energy drain.
118|Just as it recreated Kanbaru's tackle,
118|it recreated my voice.
118|If you see Kiss-Shot, tell her...
118|that I will collect my treasured demon sword, Heart Span, once I have recovered.
118|What is a samurai without his sword?
118|It has been four hundred years since I lent it to her.
118|Tell her to prepare for a late fee!
118|Araragi-senpai, what was that warrior?
118|I thought it was strange that no sword accompanied the armor, but...
118|He mentioned the demon sword Heart Span and Kiss-Shot...
118|Let's worry about that later.
118|Kanbaru...
118|Can you jump up to the ceiling from here?
118|Then climb up?
118|Then you can take the elevator shaft down to the first floor—
118|You overestimate me, Araragi-senpai.
118|I'm not that athletic.
118|Not even I can jump to the ceiling while carrying a larger boy.
118|I see.
118|Araragi-senpai.
118|Yes, Kanbaru?
118|Will you sleep with me?
118|Don't put yourself into the mood!
118|I don't want to die a virgin!
118|This isn't the time for confessions!
118|Because you always say stuff like that,
118|the story you narrated was on the backburner.
118|Oh, well.
118|This isn't such a bad way to die.
118|Araragi-senpai, dying together with you is all I wish for.
118|Uh, sorry.
118|I don't feel the same way about you.
118|Ouch. That hurts.
118|There is only one person I want to die together with.
118|The blonde aberration.
118|And she isn't here right now.
118|Therefore, we must escape this blazing building.
118|All right.
118|Guess it's time to man up.
118|To do to me what only a man can?
118|I couldn't bring myself to do that.
118|We can still jump out of a window as a last-ditch effort.
118|Yeah.
118|I also thought that was our last choice.
118|Liar
118|You were thinking about something completely different.
118|Don't get this wrong, Araragi. The first step is with the right foot.
118|But because I'm left-handed, I sometimes confuse left and right.
118|This is called Dynamite Firefighting, I believe.
118|Don't think that you're dying here.
118|If anything will kill you, it'll be me.
118|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
118|I hear your laughter beyond the door
118|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
118|You were supposed to be with me forever
118|kyoushitsu no mado ni iki o haite kaita
118|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
118|namae o awatete sode de keshita
118|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
118|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara
118|I heard your voice from the hallway
118|kokoro gomakasu you ni hayaashi de kaetta
118|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
118|itsukaraka watashi wa kimi to
118|At some point I became unable
118|hanasenaku natta
118|to talk to you normally
118|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
118|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
118|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
118|You were supposed to be next to me forever
118|nani mo iwanakutatte
118|You knew how I felt
118|sugu kizuite kureta hito
118|even when I said nothing
118|nani yori taisetsu to kizuite mo mou
118|Now I know how important you were to me,
118|me mo awanai
118|but we will never see each other again
119|I'm sorry I interrupted a rather emotional moment, Devil Brother.
119|Devil Brother
119|What's going on?
119|I wouldn't fault you for being depressed over what happened to the snail girl,
119|but I'd rather you refrain from murder-suicide with this girl here.
119|That's a serious misunderstanding.
119|Don't call her "the girl there."
119|Kanbaru is my cute junior.
119|Also, her name is Kanbaru Suruga.
119|Oh, I see.
119|So this is Gaen's niece.
119|Her name used to be Gaen Suruga.
119|It was changed to Kanbaru Suruga when Gaen's sister got married.
119|And why are you here, Ononoki?
119|Just passing by.
119|I didn't want to rescue you.
119|I was busy with my work.
119|Then I found you about to engage in a murder-suicide with a girl I didn't know,
119|and thought, "Right-o, time to bust the party."
119|Anyway, thank you, Ononoki.
119|I'm in your debt for a lot of things, but I promise I'll repay you.
119|Normally I'd advise you to amass a gargantuan fortune to repay this debt,
119|but for the time being, I'll settle for seeing my questions answered.
119|What's going on?
119|End Story
119|Shinobu Mail
119|End Story
119|Shinobu Mail Part Two
119|An armored warrior?
119|You smashed it to pieces,
119|and then it reassembled itself and used an energy drain?
119|Yeah.
119|However, I did not tell Ononoki everything.
119|I hesitated to relay to her what I myself had not yet fully adjusted to.
119|The final words of the warrior.
119|2000 Liter Fire-Fighting Foam Tank
119|Those unlikely occidental words.
119|Kiss-Shot.
119|Kiss-Shot
119|He called her by the name even I do not use.
119|And he spoke of the demon sword Heart Span.
119|Do you have an idea, Ononoki?
119|Do you think the armor is related to the work you were given?
119|Yes.
119|Yes, you're right.
119|It does fall within the scope of my duties, but when I listen to you,
119|it seems an almost completely different being than the one I was dealing with.
119|It seems to have become magnitudes more violent since I was looking into it.
119|What could have happened in these past few days?
119|It wasn't even a suit of armor when I was chasing it.
119|Hey, Ononoki.
119|What is it?
119|Can you let me off here?
119|Actually, I'm fine.
119|I'll stick it out.
119|But Kanbaru...
119|We can let her go home, right?
119|Uh, what?
119|Are you saying you want to reject your promise to Gaen?
119|Reject?
119|You were able to utilize Gaen's knowledge on the condition that you introduce this girl to her.
119|It was absolutely necessary to save Hachikuji Mayoi,
119|and realistically speaking you had no choice,
119|but a promise is a promise.
119|You show guts, Devil Brother.
119|I find it slightly attractive that you're trying to break your promise to her.
119|It's not about breaking my promise...
119|Your pectoral muscles are nice.
119|Don't touch upon that subject.
119|I want to touch them.
119|You show an unhealthy interest in my muscles.
119|I'm a corpse.
119|Showing interest in living flesh is normal.
119|What's your reason?
119|Why are you breaking your promise to Gaen?
119|It's not that I feel reluctant to introduce her to Gaen.
119|But wasn't there more to the promise?
119|Isn't she going to give her your sort of work?
119|Gaen said
119|that Kanbaru's left hand, her left arm, was important.
119|Of course, I was the one who used her knowledge,
119|and Kanbaru had nothing to do with it,
119|so the promise was made on the condition that she agrees to get involved.
119|That was a mistake.
119|I knew full well that she wouldn't refuse my request.
119|And now I've exposed her to great danger.
119|I dragged her into this mess.
119|I should have turned Gaen down as a responsible senior.
119|I can imagine how you feel.
119|You shouldn't think like that.
119|I don't recommend it.
119|That's my warning as your friend.
119|I don't remember becoming friends with you.
119|I've been thinking of you as my friend for a long time.
119|We're long past the point of no return.
119|Why don't you understand that letting her go home doesn't protect her?
119|What do you mean?
119|Oddities affect you the minute you see them. From the moment you meet them, you are cursed.
119|Didn't this girl touch the oddity?
119|I see.
119|She is now
119|...she didn't just touch it, she punched it.
119|a part of this story.
119|Punched
119|Kneel, Devil Brother.
119|Kneel. Now.
119|Do it.
119|It behooves you.
119|It behooves you
119|Hold on.
119|It won't take long.
119|Um... Ononoki...
119|Don't think we can go back to normal.
119|Think of what happened with Hachikuji Mayoi.
119|You lack resolve, Devil Brother.
119|You think you can always have a fresh start in life, right?
119|You think it's never too late for something, right?
119|You think you can always rebound even if you fail, right?
119|That life always balances out to zero at the end?
119|Hah.
119|Well, at the end of life there's zero left.
119|If you really treasure that girl, Devil Brother,
119|you will not irresponsibly send her home,
119|but take her to Gaen.
119|Have Gaen protect her.
119|Gaen?
119|Yes.
119|Protect
119|Have her be protected, not the promise rejected.
119|Reject
119|She's right.
119|Sending her home might be far more irresponsible.
119|I didn't seek the freedom to ruin my entire life by breaking a promise I made to Gaen.
119|Even without that, I want to keep my promise.
119|I should keep it.
119|No, let's be honest.
119|Obviously I didn't want to involve her with such a dangerous armor,
119|and if the question is whether or not I want to get caught up in it myself, the answer is also no.
119|However, I have no choice.
119|He entrusted me with a message.
119|A message to "my master."
119|I have to get involved if the armor really is what I think it is,
119|no matter how unlikely it seems to me.
119|I can't ignore it.
119|I can't go home until this is resolved.
119|You seem to have made a decision.
119|Golly, how bothersome friends can be.
119|I will now pursue the armored oddity you reportedly saw.
119|Judging by the way it vanished, I don't think I'll find it.
119|Going on fool's errands is my specialty.
119|Being on fool's errands and stepping on your face.
119|Don't correct yourself.
119|Don't make it your specialty.
119|Carry the niece to the meeting point you and Gaen decided on.
119|Explain your situation.
119|Your sentence makes it sound like she's my niece.
119|We should all leave this area soon.
119|Enjoying emotional moments in front of burned-out ruins is fine too.
119|It won't be long before police and fire fighters arrive.
119|A good specialist knows when to take flight.
119|Are you awake?
119|Araragi!
119|Are you okay?
119|What are you doing?
119|I have no idea what's going on, but my instincts are telling me not to pass up this chance.
119|Amazing instincts...
119|What are they telling her?
119|They're saying too much.
119|I can't walk yet.
119|You will have to carry me for a while.
119|I guess that's fine.
119|Just a little while.
119|I'm exhausted mentally, to say nothing of physically.
119|I don't feel so well.
119|Not well?
119|It makes me remember the Shrine of the Polar Snake.
119|Araragi, are we headed to the person you wanted to introduce me to?
119|Uh, yeah...
119|About that...
119|I have to apologize to you.
119|No need for apologies!
119|In fact, I don't even want you to.
119|Seeing you bow in apology would sully my name.
119|And being carried by me does not?
119|Kanbaru
119|Suruga
119|See it getting all dirty?
119|Seriously though, it might be dangerous to send you home now.
119|You should stay with me until we know what's going on.
119|I will always respond to your requests like this...
119|Dig in!
119|That's so annoying!
119|But also cute!
119|I would be interested in knowing where we're going, though.
119|To the meeting point, like you said.
119|You might know it.
119|It's called Rouhaku Park.
119|Rouhaku?
119|Maybe it's read Namishiro.
119|Senjougahara hung out there in middle school.
119|I might remember when I see it.
119|Sounds good to me, Araragi!
119|So, we're going to that park now, right?
119|And I'm going to meet someone there?
119|Yeah...
119|Well, Araragi,
119|aren't we going the completely wrong way then?
119|What? But...
119|Let's turn back and go the right way.
119|Sorry, Kanbaru.
119|It's no big deal.
119|You got it.
119|Just do your thing.
119|Bargain Sale Ahead
119|Stop
119|One hour later
119|We wound up somewhere we'd never seen before.
119|By the way, Araragi.
119|Didn't you tell me once you that you lost track in the past?
119|You know, when you were with Hachikuji?
119|No, wait.
119|The Lost Cow is gone.
119|But...
119|You will go home now without detours.
119|No, wait.
119|Would he really do something like this, truly malicious and not just a practical joke?
119|Besides, even if it's his fault that we're lost, why would he do it?
119|What will he do now that we're lost?
119|Kanbaru, I'm letting go.
119|Is it because I'm fat?
119|No.
119|Actually, you're pretty thin.
119|Give up at level one.
119|Calling
119|Gaen Izuko
119|Hello hello, Koyomin. I've been waiting a long time.
119|I figured it was about time you called me.
119|What's up right now?
119|Tell your friend Gaen.
119|Um...
119|Gaen Izuko
119|Crab
119|Crab? Snail? Monkey? Snake? Cat?
119|Snail
119|Monkey
119|Snake
119|Cat
119|What do you know?
119|I know everything.
119|You know that.
119|I'm just kidding!
119|Why so serious, Koyomin?
119|One of them is bound to be right if I mention all five.
119|It's a dirty trick adults use.
119|Gaen Izuko
119|Snail
119|Lost
119|Snail
119|Personally, my money is on the snail.
119|Cow
119|Well, that's correct.
119|Come on, only the snail would give you enough time to call for help.
119|By analogy.
119|So what is it?
119|You're correct.
119|Kanbaru and I were headed to the park where we were going to meet you,
119|but we've already wasted more than an hour.
119|Gaen Izuko
119|It turned out to be the most trivial one of what I imagined.
119|Koyomin.
119|Get over here ASAP.
119|I want to talk about the rest in person.
119|Like I was saying, we have trouble reaching you.
119|I would like some kind of advice.
119|Children Passing
119|I don't have to give you advice.
119|You're hardly even in trouble.
119|I want you to deal with that yourself.
119|Thankfully, this isn't the first time that you've been lost.
119|Koyomin,
119|let us heed Meme's philosophy and save ourselves alone.
119|No.
119|Gaen Izuko
119|Not alone.
119|You have someone with you to rely on.
119|Rely on her.
119|Rely on her?
119|Just who do you think Kanbaru is?
119|Kanbaru is—
119|Kanbaru Suruga is my sister's daughter.
119|Gaen Izuko
119|Don't let her intellect go to waste.
119|She just hung up on me
119|Are you done with your call, Araragi?
119|I can see from your expression that you want something from your slave.
119|I have no slave.
119|Then my opinion is not required.
119|How reassuring.
119|No, it is.
119|It is required.
119|Kanbaru, if you have an idea, please.
119|Okay, got it.
119|This way.
119|I don't know where the park is, but if it's near where Senjougahara used to live,
119|then I can smell out the rough direction.
119|Let's go!
119|By smell? Not sight?
119|Come on, Araragi.
119|Araragi, the Lost Cow makes people lose track.
119|All we have to do is avoid tracks.
119|At around three in the morning, we finally reached
119|Namishiro Park
119|Rouhaku Park.
119|Huh?
119|Barely three hours passed since our phone call.
119|I can't imagine she got impatient and went home.
119|Well, Araragi.
119|Normal human beings would go home after waiting for three hours at night.
119|Well, I guess...
119|Oh.
119|Just as I was made to be lost on the way here,
119|Gaen perhaps had to face some kind of oddity while waiting and is no longer here.
119|Kanbaru. There's something I want.
119|Go right ahead!
119|No.
119|It could be fruitless, but let's split up and search the park.
119|Call out if you find something.
119|Do you want me to scream?
119|No screaming.
119|I'd serve time.
119|Roger. I serve you.
119|Serve
119|Serve Time
119|Serve You
119|Araragi! Over here!
119|I can't see anyone.
119|Oh, please.
119|Take a closer look.
119|Shinobu!
119|Oh, you.
119|You took your sweet time.
119|That's so cute.
119|Why are you here, Shinobu?
119|The monkey...
119|It was a tough nut.
119|Yes, this little kitten was a handful.
119|Cat, huh?
119|Let's ignore the pervert for now.
119|No, my master.
119|I didn't mean her when I spoke of the monkey.
119|It was wearing a raincoat and rubber boots, but it wasn't her.
119|It wasn't her?
119|I'm speaking of the oddity I fought earlier.
119|Together with the cat.
119|What are you talking about?
119|It was all very dashing.
119|Well, these are all just scratches.
119|Nothing bad.
119|Have you been all right?
119|Yeah... As for the darkness...
119|No need.
119|I got a rough rundown.
119|It appears I was mistaken for four hundred years.
119|How foolish.
119|A rundown? From whom?
119|From whom do you think?
119|I asked the little girl that stepped on your face.
119|The little girl that stepped on my face?
119|What could you possibly be talking about?
119|The only one who ever stepped on me barefoot is you.
119|I didn't say anything about being barefoot.
119|Oh, no!
119|Is this what "the tongue ever turns to the aching tooth" means?
119|And you ache well and good, it seems.
119|By the way, one can clearly see marks of cute feet on your face.
119|Oh, no!
119|I've been wondering this whole time what happened while I was unconscious.
119|Tell me!
119|Tell me if you saw it!
119|Did you think it was funny being carried by someone like that?
119|Normally I would want to skin you out of spite for such a mark,
119|but we were unwillingly saved by the doll.
119|Let us overlook this matter.
119|Saved?
119|Honestly, what happened, Shinobu?
119|Nothing major.
119|The cat and I were attacked by the monkey.
119|The doll appeared and, surprisingly, assisted us in our terrible battle.
119|What was it called, her secret weapon?
119|"A rulebook of mostly exceptions"
119|Unlimited Rulebook...
119|She used that to blast away the right side of its body.
119|And you talked to her after that?
119|So...
119|That could be how she found out about the darkness, and probably also about the armor.
119|No, that's unlikely.
119|I'm just glad we're both unhurt.
119|No, not unhurt.
119|The link between us can apparently be restored by the master of the guy in the Hawaiian shirt.
119|The doll told me to go meet you, but...
119|When I got there, neither of you were here.
119|That's why...
119|That's why you were sleeping under a swing?
119|What kind of logic is that?
119|How do you reach that conclusion?
119|Okay, maybe you were tired from your battle, but at least choose somewhere else to sleep.
119|My master.
119|Let us talk about that later.
119|Sadly, it appears my battle is not quite over.
119|I am not done fighting.
119|Our battle has only just begun.
119|I hear your laughter near me
119|You were supposed to be there forever
119|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
119|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
119|I heard your voice from the hallway
119|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
119|At some point I became unable
119|to talk to you normally
119|I can hear your laughter a ways away
119|You were supposed to be next to me forever
119|You knew how I felt
119|even when I said nothing
119|Now I know how important you were to me,
119|but we will never see each other again
120|Calling
120|I'm sorry that I interrupted a rather emotional moment, devil boy.
120|Devil boy
120|What's going on?
120|I wouldn't fault you for being depressed over what happened to the snail girl,
120|but I'd rather you refrain from committing a murder-suicide with this girl here.
120|That's a serious misunderstanding.
120|Don't call her "the girl there."
120|Kanbaru is my cute underclassman.
120|Also, her name is Kanbaru Suruga.
120|Oh, I see.
120|So this is Gaen-san's niece.
120|Her name used to be Gaen Suruga.
120|After Gaen's sister was married, it was changed to Kanbaru Suruga.
120|Ononoki-chan, why are you here?
120|Just passing by.
120|I didn't want to rescue you.
120|I was busy with my work.
120|Then I found you about to engage in a murder-suicide with a girl I didn't know,
120|and thought, "Right-o, time to bust the party."
120|Anyway, thank you, Ononoki-chan.
120|I'm in your debt for a lot of things, but I promise I'll repay you.
120|Normally, I'd advise you to amass a gargantuan fortune to repay this debt,
120|but for the time being, I'll settle for seeing my questions answered.
120|What's going on?
120|Du bist alles
120|You are everything
120|Ich kann dich hören
120|I can hear you
120|rufe meinen Namen
120|call my name
120|und wieder und wieder
120|and again and again
120|Ich kann dich hören
120|I can hear you
120|für immer und ewig
120|forever and ever
120|mein Schatz
120|my treasure
120|Owarimonogatari
120|Shinobu Mail Part Two
120|An armored warrior?
120|You smashed it to pieces
120|and then it reassembled itself and used energy drain?
120|Yeah.
120|However, I did not tell Ononoki-chan everything.
120|I hesitated to relay to Ononoki-chan what I had yet to fully adjust to myself.
120|The final words of the warrior.
120|2000 Liter Fire-Fighting Foam Tank
120|Those unlikely occidental words.
120|Kiss-Shot.
120|Kiss-Shot
120|He called her by the name even I do not use.
120|And he spoke of the demon sword Heart Span.
120|Ononoki-chan, do you have an idea about Heart Span?
120|Do you think the armor is related to the work you were given?
120|Yes.
120|Yes, you're right.
120|It does fall within the scope of my duties, but when I listen to you,
120|it seems almost like an entirely different being than the one I was just dealing with.
120|It seems to have become magnitudes more violent than it was when I was looking into it.
120|What could have happened in these past few days?
120|It wasn't even a suit of armor when I was chasing it.
120|Hey, Ononoki-chan.
120|What is it?
120|Can you let me off here?
120|Actually, I'm fine.
120|I'll stick it out.
120|Kanbaru...
120|We can let Kanbaru go home, right?
120|Uh, what?
120|Is your promise to Gaen-san something that you're willing to reject?
120|Reject?
120|You were able to utilize Gaen-san's knowledge on the condition that you introduce this girl to her.
120|It was absolutely necessary to save Hachikuji Mayoi,
120|and realistically speaking, you had no choice,
120|but a promise is a promise.
120|You show guts, devil boy.
120|I find it slightly attractive that you're trying to break your promise to Gaen-san.
120|It's not about breaking my promise...
120|Your pectoral muscles are nice.
120|Don't touch upon that subject.
120|I want to touch them.
120|You show an unhealthy interest in my muscles.
120|I'm a corpse.
120|Showing interest in living flesh is normal.
120|What's your reason?
120|Why are you breaking your promise to Gaen-san?
120|It's not that I feel reluctant to introduce her to Kanbaru.
120|But wasn't there more to the promise?
120|Isn't she going to give Kanbaru your sort of work?
120|Gaen-san said
120|that Kanbaru's left hand, her left arm, was important.
120|Of course, I was the one who used Gaen-san's knowledge
120|and Kanbaru had nothing to do with it,
120|so the promise was made on the condition that she agrees to get involved.
120|That was a mistake.
120|I knew full well that Kanbaru wouldn't refuse my request.
120|And now I've exposed Kanbaru to a great danger.
120|I dragged her into this mess.
120|As a responsible senpai, I should have turned Gaen down.
120|I can imagine how you feel.
120|You shouldn't think like that.
120|I don't recommend it.
120|That's my warning as your friend.
120|I don't remember becoming friends with you.
120|I've been thinking of you as my friend for a long time.
120|We're long past the point of no return.
120|Why don't you understand that letting her go home doesn't protect her?
120|What do you mean?
120|Aberrations affect you the minute you see them. From the moment you meet them, you are cursed.
120|Didn't this girl touch the aberration?
120|I see.
120|Kanbaru Suruga is now
120|...she didn't just touch it, she punched it.
120|a part of this story.
120|Punched
120|Kneel, devil boy.
120|Kneel. Now.
120|Do it.
120|Posthaste.
120|Posthaste
120|Hold on.
120|It won't take long.
120|Um... Ononoki-chan...
120|Don't think we can go back to normal.
120|Think of what happened with Hachikuji Mayoi.
120|You lack resolve, devil boy.
120|You think you can always have a fresh start in life, right?
120|You think it's never too late for something, right?
120|You think you can always rebound even if you fail, right?
120|That life always balances out to zero at the end?
120|Hah.
120|Well, at the end of life there's zero left.
120|If you really treasure that girl, devil boy,
120|you will not irresponsibly send her home,
120|but instead take her to Gaen-san.
120|Have Gaen-san protect her.
120|Gaen-san?
120|Protect
120|Yes.
120|Have her be protected, not the promise rejected.
120|Reject
120|She's right.
120|Sending Kanbaru home might be far more irresponsible.
120|I didn't seek the freedom to ruin my entire life by breaking a promise I made to Gaen.
120|Even without that, I want to keep my promise.
120|I should keep it.
120|No, let's be honest.
120|Obviously, I didn't want to involve Kanbaru with such a dangerous suit of armor,
120|but if the question is whether or not I want to get caught up in it myself, the answer is also no.
120|However, I have no choice.
120|He entrusted me with a message.
120|A message to "my master."
120|I have to get involved if the armor really is what I think it is,
120|no matter how unlikely it seems to me.
120|I can't ignore it.
120|I can't go home until this is resolved.
120|You seem to have made a decision.
120|Golly, how bothersome friends can be.
120|I will now pursue the armored aberration you reportedly saw.
120|Judging by the way it vanished, I don't think I'll find it.
120|Going on fool's errands is my specialty.
120|Being on fool's errands and stepping on your face.
120|Don't correct yourself.
120|Don't make it your specialty.
120|Carry the niece to the meeting point you and Gaen-san decided on.
120|Explain your situation.
120|Your sentence makes it sound like Kanbaru's my niece.
120|We should all leave this area soon.
120|Enjoying emotional moments in front of burned-out ruins is all right, too.
120|It won't be long before police and firefighters arrive.
120|A good specialist knows when to take flight.
120|Are you awake?
120|Araragi-senpai!
120|Are you okay?
120|What are you doing?
120|I have no idea what's going on, but my instincts are telling me to not pass up this chance.
120|Amazing instincts...
120|What are they telling her?
120|They're saying too much.
120|I can't walk yet.
120|You will have to carry me for a while.
120|I guess that's fine.
120|Just a little while.
120|I'm exhausted mentally, to say nothing of physically.
120|I don't feel so well.
120|Not well?
120|It makes me remember the North Shirahebi Shrine.
120|Araragi-senpai, are we headed to the person you wanted to introduce me to?
120|Uh, yeah...
120|About that...
120|I have to apologize to you.
120|No need for apologies!
120|In fact, I don't even want you to.
120|Araragi-senpai, seeing you bow in apology would sully the name of Kanbaru Suruga.
120|And being carried by me does not, Kanbaru Suruga?
120|Kanbaru
120|Suruga
120|See it getting all dirty?
120|Seriously, though, it might be dangerous to send you home now.
120|You should stay with me until we know what's going on.
120|I will always respond to your requests like this...
120|Dig in!
120|That's so annoying!
120|But also cute!
120|I would be interested in knowing where we're going, though.
120|To the meeting point, like you said.
120|You might know it.
120|It's called Rouhaku Park.
120|Rouhaku?
120|Maybe it's read Namishiro.
120|Senjougahara hung out there in middle school.
120|I might remember when I see it.
120|Sounds good to me, Araragi-senpai!
120|We're going to that park now, right?
120|And I'm going to meet someone there?
120|Yeah...
120|Well, Araragi-senpai,
120|aren't we going the completely wrong way, then?
120|What? But...
120|Let's turn back and go the right way.
120|Sorry, Kanbaru.
120|It's no big deal.
120|You got it.
120|Araragi-senpai, just do your thing.
120|Bargain Sale Ahead
120|Stop
120|One hour later
120|We wound up somewhere we'd never seen before.
120|By the way, Araragi-senpai.
120|Didn't you tell me that you once lost your way in the past?
120|You know, when you were with Hachikuji?
120|No, wait.
120|The Lost Cow is gone.
120|But...
120|You will now go home without detours.
120|No, wait.
120|Would he really do something like this, truly malicious and not just a practical joke?
120|Besides, even if it's his fault that we're lost, why would he do it?
120|Now that Kanbaru and I are lost, what will he do?
120|Kanbaru, I'm letting go.
120|Is it because I'm fat?
120|No.
120|Actually, you're pretty thin.
120|Give up at level one.
120|Calling
120|Gaen Izuko
120|Hello, hello, Koyomin. I've been waiting a long time.
120|I figured it was about time you called me.
120|What's up right now?
120|Tell Gaen-oneesan.
120|Um...
120|Gaen Izuko
120|Crab
120|Crab? Snail? Monkey? Snake? Cat?
120|Snail
120|Monkey
120|Snake
120|Cat
120|What do you know?
120|I know everything.
120|You know that.
120|I'm just kidding!
120|Why are you so serious, Koyomin?
120|One of them is bound to be right if I mention all five.
120|It's a dirty trick that adults use.
120|Gaen Izuko
120|Snail
120|Lost
120|Snail
120|Personally, my money is on the snail.
120|Cow
120|Well, that's correct.
120|Come on, only the snail would give you enough time to call for help.
120|By analogy.
120|What is it?
120|You're correct.
120|Kanbaru and I were headed to the park where we were going to meet you,
120|but we've already wasted more than an hour.
120|It turned out to be the most trivial one of what I imagined.
120|Koyomin.
120|Hurry up and get over here.
120|I want to talk about the rest in person.
120|Like I was saying, we have trouble reaching you.
120|I would like some kind of advice.
120|Children Passing
120|I don't have to give you advice.
120|You're hardly even in trouble.
120|I want you to deal with that yourself.
120|Thankfully, this isn't the first time that you've been lost.
120|Koyomin,
120|let us heed Meme's philosophy and save ourselves alone.
120|No.
120|Gaen Izuko
120|Not alone.
120|You have an underclassman with you to rely on.
120|Rely on her.
120|Rely on her?
120|Just who do you think Kanbaru is?
120|Kanbaru is—
120|Kanbaru Suruga is my sister's daughter.
120|Gaen Izuko
120|Don't let her intellect go to waste.
120|She just hung up on me
120|Are you done with your call, Araragi-senpai?
120|I can see from your expression that you want something from your slave.
120|I have no slave.
120|Then my opinion is not required.
120|How reassuring.
120|No, it is.
120|It is required.
120|Kanbaru, if you have an idea, please.
120|Okay, got it.
120|This way.
120|I don't know where the park is, but if it's near where Senjougahara-senpai used to live,
120|then I can smell out the rough direction.
120|Let's go!
120|By smell? Not sight?
120|Come on, Araragi-senpai.
120|Araragi-senpai, the Lost Cow makes people lose track.
120|All we have to do is avoid tracks.
120|At around three in the morning, we finally reached
120|Namishiro Park
120|Rouhaku Park.
120|Huh?
120|Barely three hours have passed since our phone call.
120|I can't imagine that she got impatient and went home.
120|Well, Araragi-senpai.
120|Normal human beings would go home after waiting for three hours at night.
120|Well, I guess...
120|Oh.
120|Just as I was made to be lost on the way here,
120|Perhaps Gaen-san had to face some kind of aberration while waiting and is no longer here.
120|Kanbaru. There's something I want.
120|Go right ahead!
120|No.
120|It could be fruitless, but let's split up and search the park.
120|Call out if you find something.
120|Do you want me to scream?
120|No screaming.
120|I'd serve time.
120|Roger. I serve you.
120|Serve
120|Serve Time
120|Serve You
120|Araragi-senpai! Over here!
120|I can't see anyone.
120|Oh, please, Araragi-senpai.
120|Take a closer look.
120|Shinobu!
120|Oh, you.
120|You took your sweet time.
120|That's so cute.
120|Shinobu, why are you here?
120|The monkey...
120|It was a tough nut.
120|Yes, this little kitten was a handful.
120|Cat, huh?
120|Let's ignore the pervert for now.
120|No, my master.
120|I didn't mean her when I spoke of the monkey.
120|It was wearing a raincoat and rubber boots, but it wasn't her.
120|It wasn't her?
120|I'm speaking of the aberration that I fought earlier.
120|Together with the cat.
120|What are you talking about?
120|It was all very dashing.
120|Well, these are all just scratches.
120|Nothing bad.
120|Have you been all right?
120|Yeah... As for the darkness...
120|No need.
120|I got a rough rundown.
120|It appears that I was mistaken for four hundred years.
120|How foolish.
120|A rundown? From whom?
120|From whom do you think?
120|I asked the little girl that stepped on your face.
120|The little girl who stepped on my face?
120|What could you possibly be talking about?
120|The only one who ever stepped on me barefoot is you, Shinobu.
120|I didn't say anything about being barefoot.
120|Oh no!
120|Is this what "the tongue ever turns to the aching tooth" means?
120|And you ache well and good, it seems.
120|By the way, one can clearly see marks of cute feet on your face.
120|Oh no!
120|I've been wondering this whole time what happened while I was unconscious.
120|Tell me!
120|Tell me if you saw it!
120|Did you think it was funny to be carried by someone like that?
120|Normally, I would want to skin you out of spite for such a mark,
120|but we were unwillingly saved by the doll.
120|Let us overlook this matter.
120|Saved?
120|Honestly, what happened, Shinobu?
120|Nothing major.
120|The cat and I were attacked by the monkey.
120|The doll appeared and, surprisingly, assisted us in our terrible battle.
120|What was it called, her secret weapon?
120|"A rulebook of mostly exceptions"
120|Unlimited Rulebook...
120|She used that to blast away the right side of its body.
120|And you talked to Ononoki-chan after that?
120|So...
120|That could be how she found out about the darkness, and probably also about the armor.
120|No, that's unlikely.
120|I'm just glad that we're both unhurt.
120|No, not unhurt.
120|The link between us can apparently be restored by the master of the guy in the Hawaiian shirt.
120|The doll told me to go meet you, but...
120|When I got there, neither of you were here.
120|That's why...
120|That's why you were sleeping under a swing?
120|What kind of logic is that?
120|How do you reach that conclusion?
120|Okay, maybe you were tired from your battle, but at least choose somewhere else to sleep.
120|My master.
120|Let us talk about that later.
120|Sadly, it appears that my battle is not quite over.
120|I am not done fighting.
120|Our battle has only just begun.
120|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
120|I hear your laughter beyond the door
120|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
120|You were supposed to be with me forever
120|kyoushitsu no mado ni iki o haite kaita
120|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
120|namae o awatete sode de keshita
120|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
120|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara
120|I heard your voice from the hallway
120|kokoro gomakasu you ni hayaashi de kaetta
120|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
120|itsukaraka watashi wa kimi to
120|At some point I became unable
120|hanasenaku natta
120|to talk to you normally
120|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
120|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
120|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
120|You were supposed to be next to me forever
120|nani mo iwanakutatte
120|You knew how I felt
120|sugu kizuite kureta hito
120|even when I said nothing
120|nani yori taisetsu to kizuite mo mou
120|Now I know how important you were to me,
120|me mo awanai
120|but we will never see each other again
121|The left half is a monkey
121|The right half is a crab
121|It's not a monkey-crab battle
121|It's a monkey-crab chimera
121|I'll go from the right
121|Araragi, you go from the left
121|Let's go, Araragi!
121|Okay!
121|Kanbaru does sometimes say
121|that she confuses left and right because she's left-handed—
121|She was still sitting on the swing.
121|Why is she playing when the oddity chasing her appears?
121|It's not just unusual, it makes no sense.
121|My entire body is creaking.
121|Wait, my master.
121|Use it.
121|Use it!
121|Demon sword...
121|Heart Span.
121|Do not hesitate.
121|It is both oddity and not,
121|something evil and older than oddities are.
121|Nobody would blame you for slaying it.
121|In fact, this sword is not even the original,
121|because a certain someone fashioned it from their own flesh and blood.
121|What is a samurai without his sword?
121|It has been four hundred years since I lent it to her.
121|Kanbaru, out of the way!
121|Araragi, careful!
121|Snake Constrictor?
121|That wasn't too bad.
121|Sixty-two points.
121|End Story
121|Shinobu Mail
121|End Story
121|Shinobu Mail Part Three
121|This was a good test of your abilities, don't you think?
121|In fact, its stats seem a lot lower since I last encountered it.
121|The monkey alone was able to control the rain when it attacked me.
121|A very annoying skill.
121|Are you okay?
121|Are you hurt?
121|I'm not hurt.
121|This is so warm.
121|It has your smell.
121|Don't turn this into a romcom, please.
121|Are you sure you want me to wear this?
121|Well, even in the summer, it gets pretty cold at night.
121|Hold on, then.
121|Wear mine!
121|Sorry, Kanbaru.
121|I dragged you into this.
121|Besides, basketballs players aren't supposed to get into fights.
121|Oh, please, Araragi.
121|If you apologize that much I'll have to start thinking about whether you really mean it or not.
121|Hey, Shinobu.
121|Where were we, my master?
121|Continue.
121|Continue?
121|What were we talking about, again?
121|We were talking about the link.
121|We have to restore our link, right?
121|Otherwise, we'll struggle against imperfect oddities like that thing.
121|So how is that related to the swings?
121|Don't we have to ask, like,
121|a specialist to restore it?
121|The proof of the pudding is in the eating, my master.
121|You should try sleeping there too.
121|You will see why.
121|Let's go.
121|Holy shit!
121|This is scarier than oddities!
121|What is this?!
121|What did she hope I would do down here?
121|What did she think I would understand?
121|It's too late now, but perhaps the idiom she was looking for
121|wasn't "the proof of the pudding is in the eating,"
121|but "seeing is believing."
121|Go to
121|- >
121|Shrine of the Polar Snake
121|"I will collect my treasured demon sword, Heart Span, once I have recovered."
121|"It has been four hundred years since I lent it to her."
121|"Tell her to prepare for a late fee!"
121|Those were the words of the armor?
121|Yeah.
121|And then it laughed and left.
121|How?
121|How did it laugh?
121|Imitate it.
121|Imitate it?!
121|That's insane.
121|Something like that.
121|Shinobu...
121|It's just an idea, but...
121|Don't worry about it.
121|That's impossible.
121|It's false.
121|False?
121|He died four hundred years ago.
121|I saw it with my own eyes.
121|The heavens could crash down and the sun could shine at night, but he'd still be dead.
121|Don't waste our time with such nonsense.
121|But Shinobu...
121|It must have a reason to masquerade as him.
121|Maybe it hopes to disturb us.
121|Don't worry.
121|Just accept it.
121|No matter what it has in mind, I will keep the blade, the oddity slayer.
121|I won't give it up.
121|If it was behind the monkey and the rest,
121|then I will kill it directly.
121|There's nothing else to say.
121|Hey there, Koyomin.
121|Finally we meet.
121|There, done.
121|Notifying Yotsugi.
121|Gonna tell her I've got you here safe.
121|I gave her a little phone for that.
121|That doll looks surprisingly concerned for you.
121|"Looks" because it's obvious from looking at your face.
121|My face?
121|"Koyomin is fine."
121|Send.
121|Right-o.
121|Hello there, Oshino Shinobu,
121|Kanbaru Suruga.
121|My name is Oshino Izuko.
121|I'm the younger sister
121|of your old friend, Oshino Meme.
121|Confronted with such an obvious falsehood,
121|Purity in Spirit
121|I didn't know what to say.
121|Isn't your last name Gaen?
121|Oh?
121|Did the Hawaiian shirt guy have a little sister?
121|You do resemble each other.
121|Shinobu fell for it.
121|People say that all the time.
121|I'm sorry my brother has been making so much trouble for you.
121|I'm Kanbaru Suruga.
121|I work as
121|Araragi's sex slave.
121|Stop saying that to people!
121|I see. Sex slave, huh?
121|Enjoy the wild ride while you're young.
121|Let's get down to business,
121|everyone.
121|First, I would like to hear what kind of adventure you've had until now.
121|Spare no detail when you tell it to me.
121|I love learning about the lives of others.
121|There was no reason to leave out anything.
121|I told her everything that had happened.
121|You've become such a good storyteller, Koyomin.
121|Nice story.
121|You're like a bard.
121|A Clooney bard.
121|Let me cut straight to the point.
121|That armor is the first of her kin,
121|the one she created four hundred years ago when she was the legendary vampire,
121|the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, and cold-blooded vampire,
121|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, king and slayer of oddities.
121|Seeing as how you were bitten during spring break, it makes you number two, so he'd be your senior.
121|As he is the first oddity slayer, you could say he's simultaneously Shinobu's senior too.
121|Hey, my master.
121|This woman is an amateur!
121|Is she really the sister of the Hawaiian shirt man?
121|Tell her! Tell her, my master!
121|Smack her verbally!
121|Correct her amateurish mistakes!
121|Okay.
121|B-But G—
121|Call me Izu.
121|Izuko.
121|I said, call me Izu.
121|Izuko, Shinobu's first kin should be dead now.
121|Shinobu herself saw it.
121|He killed himself by going into sunlight.
121|He burst into flame and turned to ash and dust.
121|That's why...
121|That's why he's gone.
121|It can't be him.
121|The armor cannot be her first kin.
121|Why?
121|Like I said...
121|Why can't he be? Why?
121|Araragi.
121|Aren't vampires called immortal oddities precisely because they don't die?
121|Exactly, Kanbaru Suruga.
121|Nothing less from the one who tamed the monkey paw.
121|Admirable.
121|You see, it took him four hundred years since his suicide to finally be resurrected.
121|Rising anew from ash and bones...
121|One can only be impressed by the first kin of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.
121|May the session begin.
121|Let me expound upon this conclusion and follow the chronology.
121|The sun is, of course, a vampire's weakness.
121|Even grade schoolers know that.
121|Not even the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, and cold-blooded vampire,
121|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade,
121|is an exception to this.
121|Nor are her kin.
121|A vampire as legendary and well-known as the king of oddities may not be an exception,
121|but it can be inapplicable.
121|The weakness can be overruled.
121|Koyomin, didn't you go up in flames under the sun during spring break too?
121|Didn't you regenerate?
121|I know you did.
121|The same happened to the first one.
121|That's all there is to it.
121|Of course, it wasn't a blunder in his case, and he genuinely wanted to perish under the sun.
121|It was a temporarily successful suicide.
121|A little time was necessary to regenerate.
121|Roughly four hundred years.
121|Strictly speaking, he hasn't fully recovered even after four hundred years.
121|You should know what I mean, seeing as how you faced him.
121|You felt him becoming gradually stronger, right?
121|You see, he didn't become stronger.
121|He recovered old strength.
121|He is convalescing.
121|He's recovering his corporeality.
121|He used energy drain on you and Kanbaru like a sick person eats and drinks,
121|just like the scratches Shinobu incurred from the pseudo-oddity were healed when she ate it.
121|Shall we praise you, Koyomin, for having helped your elder on his road to swift recovery?
121|Now look.
121|I don't mean just tonight when I say that.
121|I mean all you did as an individual in recent times.
121|Are you confused?
121|Don't worry. You'll understand soon enough.
121|You know, I wanted to cut this short a long time ago.
121|I wanted Yotsugi to take care of it alone.
121|I misjudged a lot of things.
121|I may know everything, but that doesn't mean everything goes like I want it to.
121|Especially you, Koyomin,
121|because you don't act on reason and your actions are as unpredictable as a logistic map.
121|So now I'm taking responsibility for my miscalculations, and thrusting myself into the fray to seek help from you.
121|Maybe you think a shady old lady is dragging you into trouble,
121|but the truth is that the lady is giving you a chance.
121|This is your one-and-only chance to clean up the mess you've made.
121|I guess you need some more background info.
121|You might never see things my way, though.
121|Have you never wondered, Koyomin?
121|Have you never wondered why you keep running into oddities every other day for half a year?
121|Isn't it mysterious?
121|Why did the legendary vampire,
121|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade,
121|visit your town of all places during spring break.
121|Mere coincidence?
121|A crab girl,
121|a snail girl,
121|a monkey girl,
121|a snake girl, all in this city.
121|Is it mere coincidence that they and the immortal phoenix that the difficult Kagenui was hunting are in this city?
121|The cat is, well, probably a special case.
121|The samurai really did, inadvertently, step on the tiger's tail.
121|That in mind, coincidence must really love you.
121|Tiger, huh...
121|Fire and flames must be triggering a trauma for him, having once burned so bright.
121|Of course he chose to retreat for the time being.
121|If you live to see Hanekawa Tsubasa again, make sure you thank her.
121|You still understand nothing?
121|Don't worry about it, then.
121|What I mean is that your unhappy friend protected you without knowing it.
121|I believe you think that what's happening to you could have happened to someone else as well.
121|There is great humility in denying the extraordinary, but that idea is gravely flawed.
121|Flaw
121|It's a flaw so great one might want to nay-say someone who claims to think of you as special.
121|Sorry that I'm being so vague.
121|Having such a lively young man to talk to makes me want to explain the world.
121|My brother Meme may be satisfied with asking how you're doing,
121|but I regret to say that I am not as forbearing as that rookie.
121|Oh, right. I said I would cover it chronologically, didn't I?
121|You have to keep your promises, eh?
121|Though, in this case, keeping my promise is the fastest way to get results.
121|Four hundred years ago, the current Oshino Shinobu, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade,
121|having never taken someone as her kin before, made her first slave.
121|She sucked human blood.
121|As for why it came to this—
121|We can skip this part, right?
121|This is a story for a different day, and it has already been told.
121|Both for you and for him.
121|Having changed sides from oddity-hunting specialist to those he hunted,
121|he was struck by intense hate for his situation.
121|He couldn't accept that he had become a monster.
121|He wished to die.
121|He threw himself into the sunlight.
121|He turned to ash and disappeared on the wind.
121|Supposedly.
121|He left Heart-Under-Blade with all his bitterness and a replica of his demon sword, Heart Span.
121|Much obliged.
121|I already explained that this isn't the whole truth.
121|He turned to ash, returned to nothingness, but he didn't die.
121|He disappeared, but he was not annihilated.
121|He died, but not quite.
121|He lived on.
121|He lived on as nothingness.
121|And over the course of four hundred years, a time-span that could fade anyone's mind,
121|he began to recover his physical shell.
121|Whatever regenerated was quickly immolated by sunlight,
121|whatever reformed was quickly smashed,
121|and still he tenaciously recovered.
121|An unproductive recovery of trial and error continued during this soul-crushing length of time.
121|Of course, he had no conscious self while he was dust in the wind,
121|so this recovery is a basic vampiric reaction, a reflex.
121|Calling something so deplorable unproductive was unfair.
121|It was a sad eternity of game overs and continues.
121|Having inherited some fashion of immortality from the legendary vampire, he could not die.
121|He was, in the most literal way possible, undead.
121|If Yozuru had been there, she would surely have tried everything to nudge him along.
121|But then again, it was four hundred years ago.
121|Anyway.
121|He, the first oddity slayer, alone was a full and everlasting circle of reincarnation,
121|spending all but an eternity at it.
121|However...
121|His tenacity was fearsome.
121|You can see why the legendary vampire chose him.
121|Without a conscious will,
121|with very little to call a state of mind,
121|he traveled the world as wind-borne dust,
121|and clustered even as he was scattered.
121|With infinite perseverance and willpower
121|he returned to this town.
121|That was fifteen years ago.
121|I hear your laughter beyond the door
121|You were supposed to be with me forever
121|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
121|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
121|I heard your voice from the hallway
121|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
121|At some point I became unable
121|to talk to you normally
121|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
121|You were supposed to be next to me forever
121|You knew how I felt
121|even when I said nothing
121|Now I know how important you were to me,
121|but we will never see each other again
122|The left half is a monkey
122|The right half is a crab
122|It's not a monkey-crab battle
122|It's a monkey-crab chimera
122|I'll go from the right
122|Araragi-senpai, go from the left
122|Araragi-senpai, let's go!
122|Okay!
122|Kanbaru does sometimes say
122|that she confuses left and right because she's left-handed—
122|She was still sitting on the swing.
122|Why is she playing when the aberration chasing her appears?
122|It's not just unusual: it makes no sense.
122|My entire body is creaking.
122|Wait, my master.
122|Use it.
122|Use it!
122|Demon sword...
122|Heart Span.
122|Do not hesitate.
122|It is both aberration and not,
122|something evil and older than aberrations are.
122|Nobody would blame you for slaying it.
122|In fact, this sword is not even the original
122|because a certain someone fashioned it from their own flesh and blood.
122|What is a samurai without his sword?
122|It has been four hundred years since I lent it to her.
122|Kanbaru, out of the way!
122|Araragi-senpai, careful!
122|Snake Constrictor?
122|That wasn't too bad.
122|Sixty-two points.
122|Du bist alles
122|You are everything
122|Ich kann dich hören
122|I can hear you
122|rufe meinen Namen
122|call my name
122|und wieder und wieder
122|and again and again
122|Ich kann dich hören
122|I can hear you
122|für immer und ewig
122|forever and ever
122|mein Schatz
122|my treasure
122|Owarimonogatari
122|Shinobu Mail Part Three
122|This was a good test of your abilities, don't you think?
122|In fact, its stats seem a lot lower than they were when I last encountered it.
122|The monkey alone was able to control the rain when it attacked me.
122|A very annoying skill.
122|Are you okay?
122|Are you hurt?
122|I'm not hurt.
122|This is so warm.
122|Araragi-senpai, it has your smell.
122|Don't turn this into a romantic comedy, please.
122|Are you sure you want me to wear this?
122|Well, even in the summer, it gets pretty cold at night.
122|Hold on, then.
122|Wear mine!
122|Sorry, Kanbaru.
122|I dragged you into this.
122|Besides, basketballs players aren't supposed to get into fights.
122|Oh, please, Araragi-senpai.
122|If you apologize that much, I'll have to start thinking about whether you really mean it or not.
122|Hey, Shinobu.
122|Where were we, my master?
122|Continue.
122|Continue?
122|What were we talking about, again?
122|We were talking about the link.
122|We have to restore our link, right?
122|Otherwise, we'll struggle against imperfect aberrations like that thing.
122|So how is that related to the swings?
122|Don't we have to ask, like,
122|a specialist to restore it?
122|The proof of the pudding is in the eating, my master.
122|You should try sleeping there, too.
122|You will see why.
122|Let's go.
122|What is this?!
122|This is scarier than aberrations!
122|What is this?!
122|What did she hope I would do down here?
122|What did she think I would understand?
122|It's too late now, but perhaps the idiom she was looking for
122|wasn't "the proof of the pudding is in the eating"
122|but "seeing is believing."
122|Go to
122|- >
122|North Shirahebi Shrine
122|"I will collect my treasured demon sword, Heart Span, once I have recovered."
122|"It has been four hundred years since I lent it to her."
122|"Tell her to prepare for a late fee!"
122|Those were the words of the armor?
122|Yeah.
122|And then it laughed and left.
122|How?
122|How did it laugh?
122|Imitate it.
122|Imitate it?!
122|That's insane.
122|Something like that.
122|Shinobu...
122|It's just an idea, but...
122|Don't worry about it.
122|That's impossible.
122|It's false.
122|False? But...
122|He died four hundred years ago.
122|I saw it with my own eyes.
122|The heavens could crash down and the sun could shine at night, but he'd still be dead.
122|Don't waste our time with such nonsense.
122|But, Shinobu...
122|It must have a reason to masquerade as him.
122|Maybe it hopes to disturb us.
122|Don't worry.
122|Just accept it.
122|No matter what it has in mind, I will keep the demon blade, the aberration slayer.
122|I won't give it up.
122|If it were behind the monkey and the rest,
122|then I will kill it directly.
122|There's nothing else to say.
122|Hey, Koyomin.
122|We finally meet.
122|There, done.
122|Yotsugi is being notified.
122|Gonna tell her that I've got you here safe, Koyomin.
122|I gave her a little phone for that.
122|That doll looks surprisingly concerned for you.
122|"Looks" because it's obvious from looking at your face.
122|My face?
122|"Koyomin is fine."
122|Send.
122|Right-o.
122|Hello, Oshino Shinobu-san,
122|Kanbaru Suruga-san.
122|My name is Oshino Izuko.
122|I'm your old friend's,
122|Oshino Meme's, younger sister.
122|Confronted with such an obvious falsehood,
122|Purity in Spirit
122|I didn't know what to say.
122|Isn't your last name Gaen?
122|Oh?
122|Did the Hawaiian shirt guy have a little sister?
122|You do resemble each other.
122|Shinobu fell for it.
122|People say that all the time.
122|I'm sorry that my brother has been causing so much trouble for you.
122|I'm Kanbaru Suruga.
122|I work as Araragi-senpai's
122|sex slave.
122|Stop saying that to people!
122|I see. Sex slave, huh?
122|Enjoy the wild ride while you're young.
122|Let's gather together,
122|and get down to business.
122|First, I would like to hear what kind of adventure you've had until now.
122|Spare no detail when you tell it to me.
122|Onee-san loves learning about the lives of others.
122|There was no reason to leave out anything.
122|I told her everything that had happened.
122|You've become such a good storyteller, Koyomin.
122|Nice story.
122|The tale that you have sung
122|shows that you are a man young.
122|Let me cut straight to the point.
122|That armor is the first of her kin,
122|the one she created four hundred years ago when Shinobu-chan was the legendary vampire,
122|the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, and cold-blooded vampire,
122|King and slayer of aberrations, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.
122|Seeing as how you were bitten by Shinobu-chan during spring break, it makes you number two; so he'd be your senpai.
122|As he is the first aberration slayer, you could say that he's simultaneously Shinobu-chan's senior, too.
122|Hey, my master.
122|This woman is an amateur!
122|Is she really the sister of the Hawaiian shirt man?
122|Tell her! Tell her, my master!
122|Let her enjoy verbal pain!
122|Correct her amateurish mistakes!
122|Okay.
122|B-But G—
122|Izuko's my name.
122|Izuko-san.
122|Izuko's my name, can't you hear?
122|Izuko-san, Shinobu's first kin should be dead now.
122|Shinobu herself saw it.
122|He killed himself by going into sunlight.
122|He burst into flame and turned to ash and dust.
122|That's why...
122|That's why he's gone.
122|It can't be him.
122|The armor cannot be Shinobu's first kin.
122|Why?
122|Like I said...
122|Why? Why can't he be?
122|Araragi-senpai.
122|Aren't vampires called immortal aberrations precisely because they don't die?
122|Exactly, Kanbaru Suruga-san.
122|Nothing less from the one who tamed the monkey paw.
122|Admirable.
122|You see, it was not until four hundred years after his suicide that he was resurrected.
122|Rising anew from ash and bones...
122|The first kin of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade is certainly impressive.
122|May the session begin.
122|Let me expound upon this conclusion and follow the chronology.
122|The sun is, of course, a vampire's weakness.
122|Even grade schoolers know that.
122|Not even the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, and cold-blooded vampire,
122|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade,
122|is an exception to this.
122|Nor are her kin.
122|A vampire as legendary and well-known as the king of aberrations may not be an exception,
122|but it can be inapplicable.
122|The weakness can be overruled.
122|Koyomin, didn't you go up in flames under the sun during spring break, too?
122|Didn't you regenerate?
122|I know you did.
122|The same happened to the first one.
122|That's all there is to it.

122|You see, he didn't become stronger.
122|He recovered old strength.
122|He is convalescing.
122|He's recovering his corporeality.
122|He used energy drain on you and Kanbaru Suruga-san like how a sick person eats and drinks,
122|just as Shinobu-chan's scratches from the pseudo-aberration were healed when she ate it.
122|Shall we praise you, Koyomin, for having helped your elder on his road to swift recovery?
122|Now look.
122|I don't mean just tonight when I say that.
122|I mean all you did as an individual in recent times.
122|Are you confused?
122|Don't worry. You'll understand soon enough.
122|You know, I wanted to cut this short a long time ago.
122|I wanted Yotsugi to take care of it alone.
122|I misjudged a lot of things.
122|I may know everything, but that doesn't mean that everything goes like I want it to.
122|Especially you, Koyomin,
122|because you don't act on reason and your actions are as unpredictable as a logistic map.
122|So now I'm taking responsibility for my miscalculations and thrusting myself into the fray to seek help from you.
122|Maybe you think that your shady onee-san is dragging you into trouble,
122|but your onee-san is actually giving you a chance.
122|This is your one and only chance to clean up the mess you've made.
122|I guess you need some more background info.
122|You might never see things my way, though.
122|Koyomin, have you never wondered?
122|Have you never wondered why you keep running into aberrations every other day for half a year?
122|Isn't it mysterious?
122|Why did the legendary vampire,
122|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade,
122|visit your town of all places during spring break.
122|Mere coincidence?
122|A crab girl,
122|a snail girl,
122|a monkey girl,
122|and a snake girl, all in this city.
122|Is it mere coincidence that they and the immortal phoenix that the difficult Kagenui hunted are in this city?
122|The cat is, well, probably a special case.
122|The samurai really did, inadvertently, step on the tiger's tail.
122|That in mind, coincidence must really love you.
122|Tiger, huh...
122|Fire and flames must be triggering a trauma for him, having once burned so bright.
122|Of course he chose to retreat for the time being.
122|If you live to see Hanekawa Tsubasa-chan again, make sure you thank her.
122|You still understand nothing?
122|Don't worry about it, then.
122|What I mean is that your unhappy friend protected you without knowing it.
122|I believe you think that what's happening to you, Koyomin, could have happened to someone else as well.
122|There is great humility in denying the extraordinary, but that idea is gravely flawed.
122|Flaw

122|Sorry that I'm being so vague.
122|Having such a lively young man to talk to makes your onee-san want to explain the world.
122|Meme-oniichan may be satisfied with asking how you're doing,
122|but I regret to say that I am not as forbearing as that rookie.
122|Oh, right. I said I would cover it chronologically, didn't I?
122|You have to keep your promises, eh?

122|He couldn't accept that he had become a monster.
122|He wished to die.
122|He threw himself into the sunlight.
122|He turned to ash and disappeared with the wind.

122|He left Heart-Under-Blade with all of his bitterness and a replica of his demon sword, Heart Span.
122|And they all lived happily ever after.
122|I already explained that this isn't the whole truth.
122|He turned to ash, returned to nothingness, but he didn't die.

122|Calling something so deplorable unproductive was unfair.
122|It was a sad eternity of game overs and continues.
122|Having inherited some fashion of immortality from the legendary vampire, he could not die.
122|He was, in the most literal way possible, undead.
122|If Yozuru had been there, she would surely have tried everything to nudge him along.
122|But then again, it was four hundred years ago.
122|Anyway.
122|He, the first aberration slayer, was alone in a full and everlasting circle of reincarnation,
122|spending all but an eternity at it.
122|However...
122|His tenacity was fearsome.
122|You can see why the legendary vampire chose him.
122|Without a conscious will,
122|with very little to call a state of mind,
122|he traveled the world as wind-borne dust
122|and clustered even as he was scattered.
122|With infinite perseverance and willpower,
122|he returned to this town.
122|That was fifteen years ago.
122|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
122|I hear your laughter beyond the door
122|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
122|You were supposed to be with me forever
122|kyoushitsu no mado ni iki o haite kaita
122|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
122|namae o awatete sode de keshita
122|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
122|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara
122|I heard your voice from the hallway
122|kokoro gomakasu you ni hayaashi de kaetta
122|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
122|itsukaraka watashi wa kimi to
122|At some point I became unable
122|hanasenaku natta
122|to talk to you normally
122|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
122|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
122|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
122|You were supposed to be next to me forever
122|nani mo iwanakutatte
122|You knew how I felt
122|sugu kizuite kureta hito
122|even when I said nothing
122|nani yori taisetsu to kizuite mo mou
122|Now I know how important you were to me,
122|me mo awanai
122|but we will never see each other again
123|Returned?
123|To this town?
123|It was only fifteen years ago that I was in college and had this idea
123|that I could reanimate a corpse alive for a hundred years to create Ononoki Yotsugi,
123|an immortal familiar.
123|The phoenix also found its next host around then.
123|That's why I'm willing to bet that the ashes of the first oddity slayer gathered here around the same time.
123|Fifteen Years Earlier
123|There's something else that happened around fifteen years ago, on that note.
123|Hanekawa Tsubasa was given her current name when she was three.
123|Therefore, fifteen years ago.
123|Artifact spirit.
123|Phoenix.
123|Cat.
123|No. Just because those three events happened fifteen years ago doesn't mean they're all connected.
123|We should be thinking of it as the start of a time span rather than a single point in time.
123|A snail got lost eleven years ago.
123|A monkey made a wish seven years ago.
123|A crab lost her weight three years ago.
123|The snake two months ago also falls into it.
123|Are you saying that all the oddities we've covered so far were the direct fault of the ashes blown here?
123|Of course not.
123|Yozuru and the others didn't make Yotsugi here in this town.
123|It's just the connector.
123|Call it a suggestive code if you want.
123|The oddities you've encountered are your own fault.
123|I won't let you dodge the bullet there.
123|However...
123|The reason that Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade came to this city during spring break
123|is for no other purpose than these ashes.
123|End Story
123|Shinobu Mail Part Four
123|Don't be ridiculous.
123|Are you really the sister of the Hawaiian shirt man?
123|She isn't his sister
123|The reason I came to this country was because I wanted to see Mt. Fuji.
123|This hill isn't Mt. Fuji, y'know?
123|We're not in Shizuoka or Yamanashi prefecture, either.
123|Did you get lost when the three vampire hunters chased you?
123|You didn't.
123|You didn't get lost.
123|You were led
123|to this town.
123|Led...
123|How can I put this?
123|I felt like, according to Gaen, everything I went through could be traced back to that man.
123|It creeped me out.
123|Well, no.
123|It was just unpleasant.
123|What was it that I felt?
123|This feels almost like jealousy?
123|Impossible.
123|That isn't possible.
123|He died.
123|He's dead.
123|The fool wouldn't listen to what I had to say.
123|All of this is just your wild interpretation.
123|And so what if I got lost?
123|You're getting pretty assertive, Shinobu.
123|It almost seems like it would be a problem for you had he survived.
123|Shouldn't we be offering you our congratulations that your beloved slave survived and is regenerating?
123|Congratulations
123|I can check some local bars out if you want to celebrate.
123|Don't meddle in this, specialist.
123|Don't meddle in what causes me grief.
123|What do you think you know about what happened four hundred years ago?
123|I know everything.
123|There's nothing I don't know.
123|There's a reason we met here at the shrine and not in the park, too.
123|Go to
123|- >
123|Shrine of the Polar Snake
123|Can I ask a question, Izuko?
123|Of course, Kanbaru Suruga.
123|He was mostly ash when he arrived here fifteen years ago, right?
123|So how was that cycle broken?
123|How did he come to appear before Araragi as a suit of armor?
123|What do you think, Kanbaru Suruga?
123|I don't really have a clue,
123|but I assume it's related to why you changed the place we met.
123|You're clever.
123|Your intellect is being wasted.
123|I might be saying this because I'm often looked up to as well,
123|but do please support him however you can, Kanbaru Suruga.
123|Fifteen years ago he returned to this town.
123|He ended his years adrift to wash up in his hometown.
123|His seemingly endless purgatory came to an end.
123|Hometown?
123|And all those little specks of ash and dust began to assemble at the town's air pocket—
123|this shrine, the Shrine of the Polar Snake.
123|As you can see, this shrine is a mere ruin.
123|Of course, it wasn't always like this.
123|Fifteen years ago, this was a fine and orderly shrine.
123|Small and compact.
123|I don't mean that in a belittling way, but purely in praise.
123|It has to be small and compact,
123|because this is an air pocket.
123|An air pocket for oddities.
123|Easy for them to appear; easy for them to gather.
123|Evil things even older than oddities gather here.
123|And this is also where oddities end.
123|Controlling these locations allows you to prevent undesired developments.
123|Meme's job is collecting stories of oddities,
123|but mine is different.
123|I prevent oddities from appearing in the first place.
123|Therefore, I have to control these locations or I can have no impact.
123|It is because of this
123|"Air pocket for oddities"
123|that an incomparably more famous exorcist than me built this shrine and enshrined a spirit to control the area.
123|It largely succeeded.
123|The security system was working.
123|Some of the dark things that form the essence of oddities were dispersed by it.
123|We had a good spirit here.
123|But all things come to an end.
123|Koyomin, you're studying for exams, right?
123|Are you carrying a good luck charm?
123|Charms...
123|Did you know charms have an expiration date?
123|They expire when they break.
123|Even items of august power can be limited by time,
123|and this shrine, together with its spirit, reached its limit fifteen years ago.
123|You can't blame the priests—let alone the spirit—for this.
123|These are just unforeseen developments.
123|That the first kin of the legendary vampire—
123|rather, his ash, scattered across the seven seas, would assemble here, was beyond anyone's foresight.
123|Beyond their limits.
123|As a result, the Shrine of the Polar Snake fell into disrepair fifteen years ago.
123|Both spiritually and physically.
123|Your kind ravaged this shrine with naught but his ash.
123|Very impressive, Shinobu!
123|He was a specialist once, after all.
123|What is it, Koyomin?
123|You look like you just agreed with something.
123|Oh, did you recall the even more dilapidated state this shrine was in when you time-traveled to eleven years ago?
123|Yes.
123|That was his doing.
123|This shrine was meant to control the location, but it couldn't control the vampire kin.
123|Now, there were attempts to renovate the shrine several times,
123|but that's meaningless without a spirit enshrined here.
123|Every time it was renovated, it broke down; was ravaged again.
123|The real problem is that Shinobu—
123|well, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade and her kin attract oddities with their mere existence.
123|And eleven years ago, when you visited this shrine,
123|this shrine was full of such things, right?
123|You must have wondered why so many of them had gathered here.
123|They were the components of the oddities that he, the first kin, his ashes, had attracted.
123|Components—
123|food.
123|You should have some idea what happened now, even if you aren't a specialist, Koyomin.
123|You should know why his ashes were able to break out of the endless cycle of death and rebirth.
123|Yes.
123|Oddities easily appear at this shrine, and he attracted them,
123|so it synergized.
123|So it was a perfect storm.
123|He kept eating to recover his strength on these shrine grounds where no spirit dwells.
123|This was the end of the ash and the void.
123|This began a fifteen-year story of his sad revival.
123|A revival play.
123|Or, perhaps, a revenge play.
123|Good time.
123|I'm more or less done with my explanation.
123|Any questions? Koyomin? Shinobu? Kanbaru Suruga?
123|I still have a ton of questions.
123|I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?
123|What do you want us to do? What was the point of this?
123|You need to take responsibility.
123|Therefore...
123|I will allow you to.
123|I'm giving you a chance to take responsibility.
123|You and Shinobu.
123|You said that you originally wanted to have Ononoki take care of it alone.
123|You said this was all unforeseen.
123|Could you tell me what you originally had in mind?
123|Sure, but there's no way to make it work by now.
123|Do you remember why Meme came to this town?
123|Because Shinobu came here, right?
123|I believe the same is true of Kaiki.
123|And Kagenui heard about it from Kaiki.
123|Yes.
123|All those eccentric specialists came here for similar reasons.
123|The results of their investigation were relayed to me.
123|I'm just that amazing.
123|And I, collating their reports, was able to find strange links and tendencies spanning fifteen years.
123|And so I sent Yotsugi to this town again.
123|Her job was dusting off this shrine.
123|Cleaning it up.
123|When I met her in town on the last day of summer vacation, she didn't seem like she was on her mission yet.
123|Bubblegum
123|Ice Cream
123|Sweets for a Penny
123|Was she given this Cinderella task afterwards?
123|Did she fail, then?
123|Why would she fail?
123|She's dutiful enough to save both me and Shinobu in one night.
123|I guess she can be really spontaneous.
123|Perhaps even she can fail every now and then.
123|Don't act like it isn't your fault, Koyomin.
123|It is, y'know?
123|Our fault?
123|You mean because Shinobu and I used up all the evil things that were imprisoned here by Oshino's seals?
123|Did something come to mind?
123|Shinobu didn't do anything.
123|She didn't have to do anything.
123|Coming to this shrine was enough.
123|To be honest, I don't know how well Meme understood the situation.
123|He isn't a man of many words and only told me the bare minimum.
123|2000 Liter Fire-Fighting Foam Tank
123|All I know is that he had some stop-gap measures in place with the seals he had available.
123|As a result of his actions, the first kin began to starve,
123|and his progress was undone.
123|Back to a minimum of self-awareness, he then saw
123|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade
123|after four hundred years.
123|You didn't know he was here.
123|That was the first time you went to the Shrine of the Polar Snake, right?
123|So, seeing her after four hundred years invigorated his spirit,
123|and encouraged him to rouse his ashes and revive, overcoming his starvation?
123|It isn't nearly that romantic.
123|Having someone closely related physically close by
123|Like it's some teen romantic comedy
123|just gave a strong buff to his status as an oddity.
123|When Yotsugi attempted to fulfill her mission,
123|the Shrine of the Polar Snake was already empty like shed snake skin.
123|You should understand what I want you to do now.
123|Find him.
123|You and he are slaves both; you should be drawn to each other.
123|Shouldn't you have called upon Kagenui?
123|Ononoki's master, the violent hunter of immortal oddities.
123|I can't control her.
123|I want her to lament that she has no chance to display her power for her whole life.
123|What could possibly have provoked such a stance?
123|Lamenting Thighs
123|Lamenting the absence of being able to do great deeds and making a name for oneself. Exp.: Liu Bei's rule saw days of peace, with no chances to ride into battle, and the thigh's of warriors became fat.
123|I guess it'll be enough to have Ononoki on combat duty, then.
123|No.
123|After the report I received from her yesterday,
123|after having reported that you made contact with him,
123|I called for backup.
123|I have to go and meet them now.
123|Backup?
123|Is Ononoki really not enough?
123|Absolutely not.
123|I want to finish this today.
123|He has a will. He has his knowledge back.
123|He can use his energy drain at will.
123|The longer we wait, the stronger he'll become.
123|The stakes rise at every turn.
123|Unless we get going he will complete his revival.
123|Then it will be too late.
123|I'd have to call Yozuru.
123|You make her sound like a weapon of mass destruction.
123|Terrible Monster
123|I want to make sure that he's killed before he eats a human being.
123|I'll take my leave.
123|Buy yourselves some breakfast if you're hungry, Koyomin.
123|What should we do, Shinobu?
123|Nothing.
123|It didn't go according to plan for her, but I expect it now will.
123|Whatever he is, he'll be dealt with before the day is over.
123|That is all.
123|There's nothing for us to do here.
123|It's possible that he'll become stronger in my vicinity,
123|so, perhaps unlike you, I will never see him.
123|This will be handled without me.
123|Also, my master... Don't overthink this.
123|She stoked your jealousy because she found it amusing,
123|but, to me, nobody is first or second.
123|Do you think sequences matter to me after having lived for five hundred years?
123|Didn't I preface my story with this the other day?
123|Preface?
123|Envy is unbecoming.
123|A little jealousy is cute and fine by me.
123|Don't grieve.
123|You're the only one I have right now.
123|Even though I can't go home, there's no way I'd survive until tonight without eating.
123|I'm not a very big eater right now since my link to Shinobu is broken,
123|but I can't let Kanbaru starve either.
123|I request donuts.
123|Want me to grab them?
123|No. I haven't done much so far.
123|Let me at least get you all food.
123|All right.
123|I'll look at Shinobu.
123|I'll look after Shinobu.
123|Should I leave them alone?
123|This is practically their first time together.
123|I can't really take Shinobu with me into town.
123|The sun gives us some protection, but I should still have her remain here.
123|I'm extremely sorry to impose on you, but could you do something for me when you buy food?
123|Sure. Spit it out.
123|Buy me a book.
123|It went on sale today.
123|Today?
123|Sure.
123|I'll buy it for you.
123|It's a light novel. Still fine?
123|Come now, Kanbaru.
123|Do I look like the kind of guy who treats light novels as degenerate art?
123|I'm a boy in high school buying teary shoujo manga with the cover facing up.
123|Nothing I buy could embarrass me.
123|That's great to hear.
123|So what's the title?
123|"The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy."
123|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy
123|There's nothing light in that light novel!
123|What kind of book do you want me to buy?!
123|It's just gay softcore porn, right?
123|And what's with that title?
123|A book is more than its title.
123|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy!
123|The art world has been stressing the importance of a good title lately,
123|but history is full of great classics with whimsical names.
123|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy!
123|No Title
123|Young

123|Ah, Fall

123|I guess a book really is more than its cover.
123|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy!
123|Volume 21
123|What can readers expect of that book?
123|Much indeed!
123|This is the twenty-first book in the series,
123|and it was warmly anticipated by experts.
123|The new volume is coming—— Brutal assault is my favorite! So looking forward to the release date.
123|Anonymous Expert
123|That's way too many books in a series!
123|And who are those experts, exactly?!
123|It's expected the author will finally lift the great mystery that has driven the novels since the first volume.
123|That being, "Is the Brutal Garçon a gal's grandson?"
123|Great Mystery "Grandson of gal?"
123|He probably is!
123|Great Mystery "Grandson of gal?"
123|Bloodstained Serveuse
123|Hell Boy
123|Brutal Garçon
123|Heaven Girl
123|Did the author really drag that out to twenty-one volumes?
123|Heaven Girl
123|In fact, when I told you "Dig in!" yesterday,
123|Keyword "Dig In"
123|that was lifted from the main character of the novel.
123|A gay character said that?!
123|You're not going to buy it for me?
123|I'm gonna go home, then.
123|I will! Are you happy now?!
123|Oh, right, Araragi.
123|Could you also buy a bra for me?
123|No, I really can't.
123|No. You can!
123|You have excessive expectations of me in a lot of ways.
123|The design doesn't matter.
123|Just pick what you like.
123|Don't ask me about what I'd pick, please.
123|There's an enormous variety of designs, but what matters most is contained within.
123|Don't make it sound deep.
123|I'm at the limit for going without one.
123|I have the need to feel contained.
123|Only a bra can hold me in, now.
123|I've had enough.
123|Here they are.
123|"The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy."
123|The cover is valiantly competing with the title!
123|Buying just these two books is kind of embarrassing.
123|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy Part One
123|21st Book Published!
123|The mystery: Is the garçon the grandson of a gal?
123|"Dig In"
123|Brutal Garçon series 1-20 on sale!!
123|I think it's not very manly to buy other books to disguise something you bought,
123|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy Part Two
123|but it's probably still better than not concealing the unmanliness of these books.
123|That reminds me that, since my link to Shinobu was severed by the darkness,

123|Hey, number two.
123|Did you give my message to Kiss-Shot?
123|I hear your laughter beyond the door
123|You were supposed to be with me forever
123|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
123|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
123|I heard your voice from the hallway
123|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
123|At some point I became unable
123|to talk to you normally
123|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
123|You were supposed to be next to me forever
123|You knew how I felt
123|even when I said nothing
123|Now I know how important you were to me,
123|but we will never see each other again
124|Returned?
124|To this town?
124|It was only fifteen years ago that I was in college and had this idea
124|to create Ononoki Yotsugi by reanimating a corpse alive for a hundred years, creating
124|an immortal familiar.
124|The phoenix also found its next host around then.
124|That's why I'm willing to bet that the ashes of the first aberration slayer gathered here around the same time.
124|Fifteen Years Earlier
124|There's something else that happened around fifteen years ago, on that note.
124|Hanekawa Tsubasa was given her current name, Hanekawa Tsubasa, when she was three.
124|Therefore, fifteen years ago.
124|Artifact spirit.
124|Phoenix.
124|Cat.
124|No. Just because those three events all happened fifteen years ago doesn't mean they're all connected.
124|We should be thinking of it as the start of a time span rather than a single point in time.
124|A snail got lost eleven years ago.
124|A monkey made a wish seven years ago.
124|A crab lost her weight three years ago.
124|The snake two months ago also falls into it.
124|Are you saying that all the aberrations we've covered so far were the direct fault of the ashes blown here?
124|Of course not.
124|Yozuru and the others didn't make Yotsugi here in this town.
124|It's just the connector.
124|Call it a suggestive code if you want.
124|The aberrations that you've encountered are your own fault.
124|I won't let you dodge the bullet there.
124|However...
124|The reason that Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade came to this city during spring break
124|is for no other purpose than these ashes.

124|Shinobu Mail Part Four
124|Don't be ridiculous.
124|Are you really the sister of the Hawaiian shirt man?
124|She isn't his sister
124|I came to this country because I wanted to see Mt. Fuji.
124|This hill isn't Mt. Fuji, y'know?
124|We're not in Shizuoka or Yamanashi prefecture, either.
124|Did you get lost when the three vampire hunters chased you?
124|You didn't.
124|You didn't get lost.
124|You were led
124|to this town.
124|Led...
124|How can I put this?
124|I had the feeling that everything I went through could be traced back to that man—or so Gaen-san claimed.
124|It creeped me out.
124|Well, no.
124|It was just unpleasant.
124|What was it that I felt?
124|This feels almost like jealousy?
124|Impossible.
124|That isn't possible.
124|He died.
124|He's dead.
124|The fool wouldn't listen to what I had to say.
124|All of this is just your wild interpretation.
124|And so what if I got lost?
124|You're getting pretty assertive, Shinobu-chan.
124|It almost seems like it would be a problem for you if he survived.
124|Shouldn't we be offering you our congratulations that your beloved slave survived and is regenerating?
124|Congratulations
124|I can check out some local bars if you want to celebrate.
124|Don't meddle in this, specialist.
124|Don't meddle in my delicate issues.
124|What do you think you know about what happened four hundred years ago?
124|I know everything.
124|There's nothing I don't know.
124|There's a reason why we met here at the shrine and not in the park, too.
124|Go to
124|- >
124|North Shirahebi Shrine
124|Can I ask a question, Izuko-san?
124|Of course, Kanbaru Suruga-san.
124|He was mostly ash when he arrived here fifteen years ago, right?
124|So how was that cycle broken?
124|How did he come to appear before Araragi-senpai as a suit of armor?
124|What do you think, Kanbaru Suruga-san?
124|I don't really have a clue,
124|but I assume it's related to why you changed the place we met.
124|You're clever.
124|Your intellect is being wasted.
124|I might be saying this because I'm often looked up to as well,
124|but, Kanbaru Suruga-san, please support your senpai however you can.
124|Fifteen years ago, he returned to this town.
124|He ended his years adrift to wash up in his hometown.
124|His seemingly endless purgatory came to an end.
124|Hometown?
124|And all those little specks of ash and dust began to assemble at the town's air pocket—
124|this shrine, the North Shirahebi Shrine.
124|As you can see, this shrine is a mere ruin.
124|Of course, it wasn't always like this.
124|Fifteen years ago, this was a fine and orderly shrine.
124|Small and compact.
124|I don't mean that in a belittling way, but purely in praise.
124|It has to be small and compact
124|because this is an air pocket.
124|An air pocket for aberrations.
124|Easy for them to appear; easy for them to gather.
124|Evil things even older than aberrations gather here.
124|And this is also where aberrations end.
124|Controlling these locations allows you to prevent undesired developments.
124|Meme-oniichan's job is collecting stories of aberrations,
124|but mine is different.
124|I prevent aberrations from appearing in the first place.
124|Therefore, I have to control these locations, or I can't have any impact.
124|It is because of this
124|"Air pocket for aberrations"
124|that an incomparably more famous exorcist than I built this shrine and enshrined a spirit to control the area.
124|It largely succeeded.
124|The security system worked.
124|Some of the dark things that form the essence of aberrations were dispersed by it.
124|We had a good spirit here.
124|But all things come to an end.
124|Koyomin, you're studying for exams, right?
124|Are you carrying a good luck charm?
124|Charms...
124|Did you know that charms have an expiration date?
124|They expire when they break.
124|Even items of august power can be limited by time,
124|and this shrine, together with its spirit, reached its limit fifteen years ago.
124|You can't blame the priests—let alone the spirit—for this.
124|These are just unforeseen developments.
124|That the first kin of the legendary vampire—
124|rather, his ash, scattered across the seven seas, would assemble here, was beyond anyone's foresight.
124|Beyond their limits.
124|As a result, the North Shirahebi Shrine fell into disrepair fifteen years ago.
124|Both spiritually and physically.
124|Your kind ravaged this shrine with naught but his ash.
124|Shinobu-chan, that was very impressive!
124|He was once a specialist, after all.
124|What is it, Koyomin?
124|You look like you just agreed with something.
124|Oh, did you recall the even more dilapidated state this shrine was in when you time-traveled to eleven years ago?
124|Yes.
124|That was his doing.
124|This shrine was meant to control the location, but it couldn't control the vampire kin.
124|Now, there were several attempts to renovate the shrine,
124|but that's meaningless without a spirit enshrined here.
124|Every time it was renovated, it broke down, ravaged yet again.
124|The real problem is that Shinobu-chan—
124|well, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade and her kin attract aberrations with their mere existence.
124|And eleven years ago, when you visited this shrine,
124|this shrine was full of such things, right?
124|You must have wondered why so many of them had gathered here.
124|They were the components of the aberrations that he, the first kin, his ashes, had attracted.
124|Components—
124|food.
124|You should have some idea of what happened now, Koyomin, even if you aren't a specialist.
124|You should know why his ashes were able to break out of the endless cycle of death and rebirth.
124|Yes.
124|Aberrations easily appear at this shrine, he attracted them,
124|and they synced up.
124|So it was a perfect storm.
124|He kept eating to recover his strength on these shrine grounds where no spirit dwells.
124|This was the end of the ash and the void.
124|This began a fifteen-year story of his sad revival.
124|A revival play.
124|Or, perhaps, a revenge play.
124|Good time.
124|I'm more or less done with my explanation.
124|Koyomin? Shinobu-chan? Kanbaru Suruga-san? Any questions?
124|I still have a ton of questions.
124|I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?
124|What do you want us to do? What was the point of this?
124|You need to take responsibility.
124|Therefore...
124|I will allow you to.
124|I'm giving you a chance to take responsibility.
124|You and Shinobu-chan.
124|You said that you originally wanted to have Ononoki-chan take care of it alone.
124|You said this was all unforeseen.
124|Could you tell me what you originally had in mind?
124|Sure, but there's no way to make it work by now.
124|Do you know Meme-oniichan's reason for coming to this town?
124|Because Shinobu came here, right?
124|Kaiki came for the same reason.
124|As for Kagenui-san, Kaiki must have mentioned it to her.
124|Yes.
124|All of those eccentric specialists came here for similar reasons.
124|The results of their investigation were relayed to me.
124|I'm just that amazing.
124|And I, collating their reports, was able to find strange links and tendencies spanning fifteen years.
124|And so I sent Yotsugi to this town again.
124|Her job was to dust off this shrine.
124|Cleaning it up.
124|When I met her in town on the last day of summer vacation, she didn't seem like she was on her mission yet.
124|Bubblegum
124|Ice Cream
124|Sweets for a Penny
124|Was she given this Cinderella task afterwards?
124|Did she fail, then?
124|Why would Ononoki-chan fail?
124|She's dutiful enough to save both me and Shinobu in one night.
124|I guess Ononoki-chan can be really spontaneous.
124|Perhaps even she can fail every now and then.
124|Don't act like it isn't your fault, Koyomin.
124|Yotsugi-chan's failure is your fault, you know?
124|Our fault?
124|Were all of the evil things that Oshino's seals imprisoned here used up by us?
124|Did something come to mind?
124|Shinobu-chan didn't do anything.
124|She didn't have to do anything.
124|Coming to this shrine was enough.
124|I'm not sure how well Meme-oniichan understood the situation, honestly.
124|He isn't a man of many words and only told me the bare minimum.
124|2000 Liter Fire-Fighting Foam Tank
124|All I know is that he had some stop-gap measures in place with the seals he had available.
124|As a result of his actions, the first kin began to starve,
124|and his progress was undone.
124|Back to a minimum of self-awareness, he then saw
124|Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade
124|after four hundred years.
124|You didn't know he was here.
124|Shinobu-chan, that was the first time you went to the North Shirahebi Shrine, right?
124|So, seeing her after four hundred years invigorated his spirit
124|and encouraged him to rouse his ashes and revive, overcoming his starvation?
124|It isn't nearly that romantic.
124|Having someone closely related physically close by
124|Like it's some teen romantic comedy
124|just gave a quick boost to his status as an aberration.
124|When Yotsugi attempted to fulfill her mission,
124|the North Shirahebi Shrine was already empty like shed snake skin.
124|You should understand what I want you to do now, Koyomin.
124|Find him.
124|You and he are slaves both; you should be drawn to each other.
124|Shouldn't you have called upon Kagenui-san?
124|Ononoki-chan's master, the violent hunter of immortal aberrations.
124|I can't control her.
124|I want her to lament that she has no chance to display her power for her whole life.
124|What could possibly have provoked such a stance?
124|Lamenting Thighs
124|Lamenting the absence of being able to do great deeds and making a name for oneself. Exp.: Liu Bei's rule saw days of peace, with no chances to ride into battle, and the thigh's of warriors became fat.
124|I guess it'll be enough to have Ononoki-chan on combat duty, then.
124|No.
124|After the report that I received from Yotsugi yesterday,
124|after having reported that you made contact with him,
124|I called for backup.
124|I have to go and meet them now.
124|Backup?
124|Is Ononoki-chan really not enough?
124|Absolutely not.
124|I want to finish this today.
124|He has a will. He has his knowledge back.
124|He can use his energy drain at will.
124|The longer we wait, the stronger he'll become.
124|The stakes rise at every turn.
124|Unless we get going, he will complete his revival.
124|Then it will be too late.
124|I'd have to call Yozuru.
124|You make Kagenui-san sound like a weapon of mass destruction.
124|Terrible Monster
124|I want to make sure that he's killed before he eats a human being.
124|I'll take my leave.
124|Buy yourself some breakfast if you're hungry, Koyomin.
124|What should we do, Shinobu?
124|Nothing.
124|It didn't go according to plan for her, but I expect it will now.
124|Whatever he is, he'll be dealt with before the day is over.
124|That is all.
124|There's nothing for us to do here.
124|It's possible that he'll become stronger in my vicinity,
124|so, perhaps unlike you, I will never see him.
124|This will be handled without me.
124|Also, don't overthink this... my master.
124|She stoked your jealousy because she found it amusing,
124|but, to me, nobody is first or second.
124|Do you think sequences matter to me after having lived for five hundred years?
124|Didn't I preface my story with this the other day?
124|Preface?
124|Envy is unbecoming.
124|A little jealousy is cute and fine by me.
124|Don't grieve.
124|You're the only one that I have right now.
124|Even though I can't go home, there's no way that I'd survive until tonight without eating.
124|I'm not a very big eater right now because my link to Shinobu is broken,
124|but I can't let Kanbaru starve, either.
124|I request donuts.
124|Want me to grab them?
124|No. I haven't done much so far.
124|Let me at least get you all some food.
124|All right.
124|I'll look at Shinobu-chan.
124|I'll look after Shinobu-chan.
124|Is it really okay?
124|This is practically Shinobu and Kanbaru's first time together.
124|I can't really take Shinobu with me into town.
124|The sun gives us some protection, but I should still have her remain here.
124|Araragi-senpai, I'm extremely sorry to impose on you, but could you do something for me when you buy food?
124|Sure. Spit it out.
124|Buy me a book.
124|It went on sale today.
124|Today?
124|Sure.
124|I'll buy it for you.
124|It's a light novel. Still fine?
124|Come now, Kanbaru-kun.
124|Do I look like the kind of guy who treats light novels as degenerate art?
124|I'm a boy in high school buying teary shoujo manga with the cover facing up.
124|Nothing I buy could embarrass me.
124|That's great to hear.
124|So, what's the title?
124|"The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy."
124|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy
124|There's nothing light in that light novel!
124|What kind of book do you want your senpai to buy?!
124|It's just softcore Boys' Love, right?
124|And what's with that title?
124|A book is more than its title.
124|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy!
124|The art world has been stressing the importance of a good title lately,
124|but history is full of great classics with whimsical names.
124|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy!
124|No Title
124|Young
124|Murderous Attendant
124|Ah, Fall
124|Abababa
124|Who

124|I guess a book really is more than its cover.
124|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy!
124|Volume 21
124|What can readers expect of that book?
124|Much indeed!
124|This is the twenty-first book in the series
124|and it was warmly anticipated by experts.
124|The new volume is coming Brutal assault is my favorite! So looking forward to the release date.
124|Anonymous Expert
124|That's way too many books in a series!
124|And who exactly are those experts?!
124|It's expected that the author will finally lift the great mystery that has driven the novels since the first volume.
124|That being, "Is the Brutal Garçon a gal's grandson?"
124|Great Mystery "Grandson of gal?"
124|He probably is!
124|Great Mystery "Grandson of gal?"
124|Bloodstained Serveuse
124|Hell Boy
124|Brutal Garçon
124|Heaven Girl
124|Did the author really drag that out to twenty-one volumes?
124|Heaven Girl
124|In fact, when I told you "Dig in!" yesterday,
124|Keyword "Dig In"
124|that was lifted from the main character of the novel.
124|A Boys' Love character said that?!
124|You're not going to buy it for me?
124|I'm gonna go home, then.
124|I will! Are you happy now?!
124|Oh, right, Araragi-senpai.
124|Could you also buy a bra for me?
124|No, I really can't.
124|No. You can!
124|Kanbaru-kun, you have excessive expectations of me in a lot of ways.
124|The design doesn't matter.
124|Araragi-senpai, just pick what you like.
124|Don't ask me about what I'd pick, please.
124|There's an enormous variety of designs, but what matters most is contained within.
124|Don't make it sound deep.
124|I'm at the limit for going without one.
124|I have the need to feel contained.
124|Only a bra can hold me in now.
124|I've had enough.
124|Here they are.
124|"The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy."
124|The cover is valiantly competing with the title!
124|Buying just these two books is kind of embarrassing.
124|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy Part One
124|21st Book Published!
124|The mystery: Is the garçon the grandson of a gal?
124|"Dig In"

124|I think it's not very manly to buy other books to disguise something you bought,

124|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy Part One
124|The Brutal Garçon Devours The Half-Boy Part Two
124|but it's probably still better than not concealing the unmanliness of these books.
124|That reminds me that, because my link to Shinobu was severed by the darkness,

124|Hey, Number Two.
124|Did Kiss-Shot receive my message?
124|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
124|I hear your laughter beyond the door
124|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
124|You were supposed to be with me forever
124|kyoushitsu no mado ni iki o haite kaita
124|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
124|namae o awatete sode de keshita
124|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
124|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara
124|I heard your voice from the hallway
124|kokoro gomakasu you ni hayaashi de kaetta
124|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
124|itsukaraka watashi wa kimi to
124|At some point I became unable
124|hanasenaku natta
124|to talk to you normally
124|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru

124|Now I know how important you were to me,
124|me mo awanai
124|but we will never see each other again
125|Don't look so uneasy, Number Two.
125|I'm a specialist.
125|Times have changed, but I won't ignore the mark of someone else in my trade.
125|"This is my prey, so hands off."
125|That's what the mark on your face means.
125|I won't attack you while you bear it.
125|If it wasn't there...
125|I would never let a vampire live.
125|I'm glad a little girl stepped on my face after all.
125|This looks good.
125|Here we can talk in peace.
125|Araragi Koyomi... That was your name, I believe?
125|Let me call you Sir Araragi, if you please.

125|Break up with Kiss-Shot.
125|Shinobu Mail
125|End Story
125|Shinobu Mail Part Five
125|My goal is
125|making up with Kiss-Shot, known as Oshino Shinobu to you.
125|M-Making...
125|Up.
125|We broke up after an argument.
125|I said some things I didn't mean and hurt her.
125|I want to apologize and hope she'll forgive me.
125|And then... I want to combat oddities with her again.
125|Her divine beauty sends shivers down my spine.
125|I want to be the blade that protects her.
125|You probably have no eye for it.
125|Say what you want, but my impression is that you want to get close to her to enact your revenge.
125|Revenge? For what?
125|Do I have a reason to resent her?
125|A reason?
125|Yes.
125|Telling me you didn't mean what you said is a lie.
125|What you said to her was very cruel.
125|Yes, I don't deny that.
125|That's why I want to apologize.
125|I want to apologize directly.
125|She only needs one kin.
125|She revived me when I was on the brink of death.
125|It made me very salty at the time, but now I'm grateful to her.
125|Does what I say sound that strange to you?
125|Using the word "salty" is what's strange to me,
125|but I can't refute what you're saying
125|because I feel the exact same way.
125|Are you reluctant to break up?
125|Anybody could replace you, but nobody can replace me.
125|I am special, you see.
125|I'm the chosen human.
125|I love lines like that.
125|I wish I had a chance to say them.
125|Sadly, they're too presumptuous for me.
125|Nothing is gained by discord between us.
125|In the end, we are basically two men fighting over one woman.
125|Oddities wouldn't meddle in a fight between their slaves.
125|What's going to happen now?
125|Will we be showering each other with praise?
125|That would be quite unsightly.
125|I'll show you the merits.
125|Let me explain the positive outcomes once you break up with her.
125|While I do that, try to think of the good things that can happen if you don't break up.
125|The merits? The positives?
125|You would be released from Kiss-Shot if you break up.
125|Think of it as me shouldering the responsibility that has, until now, been borne by you.
125|I gave her your message.
125|I don't think she wants to
125|see you.
125|I see.
125|I'm not that surprised.
125|But whatever her feelings, I must have back what I gave away.
125|My sword...
125|And my position.
125|I want to try again.
125|I want to shine again, after four hundred years.
125|I see nothing wrong with that.
125|Try what again? Being human, not her kin, right?
125|Even if your goal wasn't enacting revenge on her, perhaps you want to be human ag—
125|I can't go back to being human.
125|It's been four hundred years.
125|Too much time has passed.
125|I am different from you in that respect.
125|You know, I'm past lamenting that.
125|It's too late now, and that's precisely why I can spend eternity semi-permanently with her.
125|Maybe you think of that kind of love as pure,
125|but nowadays that'd make you a stalker.
125|Look, let's not turn this into a dung-flinging contest.
125|Have you thought of something?
125|What good could possibly come to you if you stay together with Kiss-Shot?
125|Don't just drink what's given to you by the enemy.
125|Your link might be broken, but if that's holy water, you'd be done for.
125|Friggin' hilarious.
125|Seems that we've been interrupted, Sir Araragi.
125|We could have skipped a few pages if you had drunk my wholly, and holy, unpoisoned chalice.
125|If you so choose to cleanse yourself, why, that can hardly be called ignoring the mark.
125|Don't be mad, kin of Heart-Under-Blade.
125|There are many ways to exorcise oddities.
125|Deceit and treachery are just as respectable as any other.
125|Looks like we made it.
125|How nice.
125|Nice to meet you, First One.
125|My name is Gaen Izuko.
125|I know everything.
125|I've come to negotiate with you.
125|Sir Araragi, I believe our conversation is at an end.
125|I must excuse myself.
125|We couldn't find common ground.
125|I'm afraid I must take our relationship to the next level.
125|Conversation?
125|We duel.
125|Tonight, we fight to the death.
125|I leave the details to the specialist squad over there.
125|I will hopefully recover all my abilities before then.
125|Please work on removing that mark, Sir Araragi.
125|I will neither run nor hide.
125|Why aren't Episode and Gaen going after him?

125|Ononoki?
125|They've been like that since I arrived.
125|Like what?
125|Well,
125|you've got guts. I'll grant you that.
125|You take after your elder in your foolhardy refusal to back away from me.
125|I won't get angry now. I'll be a mature, forbearing, five hundred year old adult.
125|If you take back what you said earlier, I will forget this little incident.
125|Apologize,
125|and I will forgive you.
125|I won't take it back.
125|I won't apologize.
125|I'll repeat what I said.
125|Shinobu, you have to meet him.
125|You have to meet the first oddity slayer.
125|Cutting ties with some you worked with, reincarnated after four hundred years?
125|That isn't good.
125|Not good at all.
125|It's not the right thing to do.
125|I have no idea what you're talking about.
125|If you want to lecture me, at least provide some kind of logic.
125|Who cares about logic?
125|Stop whining and meet him!
125|He spent four hundred years regenerating just to meet you.
125|Why won't you meet him?!
125|I told you that you misunderstand.
125|He didn't regenerate out of sentimental attachment.
125|The wind brought his scattered ashes together and they reached an excited state. It was a natural phenomenon.
125|And love is also a natural phenomenon!
125|Don't refuse someone's love!
125|Why do you just
125|not understand?
125|That isn't how the relationship between vampire and kin or master-servant works.
125|It's not a matter of love or hate,
125|you silly fool.
125|Your relationship has nothing to do with love or hate...
125|Would you say that with Araragi present?
125|Don't you remember what I told him earlier?
125|The only one I have to call kin right now is your friend.
125|Right now.
125|Maybe you don't understand what I say, but I don't understand that sentence.
125|I don't like it in the least.
125|It sounds like having more kin than one is a problem.
125|Is there no way for you three to all get along?
125|Three people...
125|Are you saying we should make up?
125|I don't care if you make up.
125|If you say you want to choose Araragi over the first oddity slayer, fine.
125|But you have to tell him that!
125|Don't leave it to Izuko or Araragi.
125|You understand nothing.
125|Not my relationship with him.
125|Not even my relationship with my current master.
125|Do you dispute that?
125|No, I don't.
125|But I know more than you think.
125|I know how it feels to be first
125|and yet still be in second place.
125|Kanbaru empathizes with the first oddity slayer more than any of us.
125|With that persistent feeling so much like pure love.
125|I have nothing to tell him even if we meet.
125|Accept reality, monkey girl.
125|He is largely responsible for the outbreak of oddities in this town,
125|and he will be hunted down by specialists.
125|I know!
125|That's why—
125|That's why? That's why I have to see him?
125|He hates me.
125|He might kill me.
125|He wants his demon sword back.
125|He might not be content with killing only me with it.
125|Take that into account, and—
125|You still have to see him!
125|Nobody cares about logic!
125|Why do people refuse to see others because of "logic"?
125|It solves nothing!
125|Unless you meet in person, nothing improves!
125|You can't create a story unless you talk!
125|Just say it, Shinobu.
125|You're scared.
125|Scared of seeing him.
125|You don't want to be emotionally swayed by what he could say.
125|You think meeting him would be akin to cheating on Araragi,
125|so maybe you want to get it over with without meeting him,
125|but that's a mistake.
125|The only one you're cheating is yourself.
125|Just tell him.
125|Tell him that you can't be expected to hang onto his love for four hundred years!
125|Tell him that by reviving now, he endangers what you've built with Araragi!
125|Tell him his love is a problem for you!
125|Tell him he should have stayed in his grave!
125|Tell him.
125|If you can't do that, then don't lecture me about lords and masters.
125|You're being neither aloof nor noble.
125|You're just bad with people.
125|Master-servant relationship, my ass.
125|You have the right to have neither slave nor master.
125|You don't have the right to build a relationship.
125|Why the romantic hand-holding?
125|Sorry. Thought you were Senjougahara.
125|You creep.
125|Wait just a moment, Ononoki.
125|Why?
125|This is getting ugly.
125|Still.
125|Will those be your last words?
125|I really want to split your head open, even if it ruins everything.
125|Then do it.
125|I won't apologize.
125|Do it and be on bad terms with Araragi.
125|You'd just avoid him like you avoid the first oddity slayer.
125|Just like you consigned him to the past,
125|you'd consign Araragi to some ancient fairy tale.
125|You'll throw away the second like you threw away the first.
125|How would you face the second when you can't face the first?
125|Number three, four, five—just keep breaking up forever!
125|Forever...
125|You're immortal, right?
125|I'm sure Araragi told you
125|that if you died tomorrow he would go with you.
125|But you wouldn't say that.
125|Even if you said it, you'd tell the third the same.
125|And the fourth.
125|And the fifth.
125|You'd repeat it over and over,
125|and still survive.
125|Not everyone is as sociable as you.
125|You called me shy earlier.
125|Not wanting to see someone is a perfectly natural emotion.
125|It's not natural.
125|Some people don't see eye to eye, but we have to see them anyway.
125|I'm not "people."
125|Perhaps.
125|It certainly looks like it.
125|I have nothing I could tell him when we'd meet.
125|Our union ended in spite, and spite was the only thing uniting us in death.
125|I have no intention of patching things up, or having the three of us get along together.
125|I have no intention of talking about them as equals.
125|Merely comparing the two is a disservice to my current master.
125|What good is there in showing him my present harmony?
125|What good is there in showing him no affection?
125|Are you saying I should be so pointlessly cruel?
125|Yes, I'm saying you should be cruel.
125|It's your job to hurt your old partner.
125|Do you want to be both a good person and loved by others?
125|Do you want to languish in love?
125|You're basically saying things should be smashed before they fade.
125|Yes, I am, damn it!
125|If he still hates me and tries to kill me, I'd be forced to kill him.
125|Are you fine with that?
125|I am.
125|Provide a relief for his hatred.
125|You can end the cycle.
125|But if he apologizes and you forgive him...
125|The outcome is the same.
125|Once I forgive him, he will be exorcised by the specialists.
125|Are you fine with that?
125|I am.
125|I am!
125|If you are right and he's come back to life out of love for me, I won't respond to his feelings.
125|All I can render unto him is cruelty.
125|Are you fine with that?
125|I am.
125|What if I meet him and, hypothetically, want to respond to his feelings?
125|What if I choose the first oddity slayer over your friend?
125|Are you fine with that?
125|I am.
125|Break up with Araragi, properly,
125|and be united in eternity with the other.
125|That was the first time I saw Shinobu surrender one on one.
125|I want you to do something, Ononoki.
125|Can you take off this stamp?
125|I can't guarantee your safety if I take it off.
125|I want to try this duel thing.
125|Did you take care of the formalities?
125|Yes, of course.
125|She's very diligent about that.
125|She chased down the first oddity slayer and negotiated with him.
125|Where do we have this duel you set up for us?
125|Where do I have to go?
125|Oh, that.
125|You should be familiar with it.
125|I have some fateful attachments to it too.
125|Fateful?
125|The grounds of Naoetsu Private High School.
125|Having been thoroughly reprimanded by Kanbaru,
125|Shinobu decided to pout and go to sleep.
125|She hid in the shrine.
125|Having been obliterated by a high school girl must have gotten to her.
125|Huh? What are you doing, Kanbaru?
125|Why are you sleeping here?
125|You're bleeding on your head.
125|Are you okay?
125|Weren't you hiding over there, Araragi? You know the answer.
125|You knew?!
125|Don't worry.
125|Shinobu didn't notice.
125|So, Araragi, did you buy me my books?
125|Is that really the most important thing right now?
125|How important are they to you?
125|At least let me look at your head.
125|She'll be fine.
125|Let's have lunch, Kanbaru.
125|I'll just start reading now, so feed me.
125|No way.
125|Who'd do that for their junior?
125|Where's Shinobu?
125|What about the bra, Araragi?
125|I bought it.
125|Here.
125|Bra
125|I'll just start reading now, so put it on.
125|That's a totally different moan!
125|Kanbaru, by the way.
125|Do you have some death-defying advice for me too?
125|I'd tell you DIY if you really want something.
125|DIY?
125|Do Your Best.
125|Hang in there!
125|That would come out to DYB abbreviated.
125|Do-It-Yourselfer
125|DIY means Do It Yourself.
125|I decided against correcting her,
125|since it perfectly fit the current situation.
125|I hear your laughter beyond the door
125|You were supposed to be with me forever
125|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
125|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
125|I heard your voice from the hallway
125|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
125|At some point I became unable
125|to talk to you normally
125|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
125|You were supposed to be next to me forever
125|You knew how I felt
125|even when I said nothing
125|Now I know how important you were to me,
125|but we will never see each other again
126|Don't look so uneasy, Number Two.
126|I'm a specialist.
126|Times have changed, but I won't ignore the mark of someone else in my trade.
126|"This is my prey, so hands off."
126|That's what the mark on your face means.
126|I won't attack you while you bear it.
126|If it weren't there...
126|I would never let a vampire live.
126|I'm glad a little girl stepped on my face after all.
126|This looks good.
126|Here we can talk in peace.
126|Araragi Koyomi... That was your name, I believe?
126|Araragi-dono, if I may call you that.
126|I won't beat around the bush, Araragi-dono.
126|Break up with Kiss-Shot.
126|Du bist alles
126|You are everything
126|Ich kann dich hören
126|I can hear you
126|rufe meinen Namen

126|forever and ever
126|mein Schatz
126|my treasure
126|Owarimonogatari
126|Shinobu Mail Part Five
126|My goal is
126|making up with Kiss-Shot, known as Oshino Shinobu to you.
126|M-Making...
126|Up.
126|Kiss-Shot and I broke up after an argument.
126|I said some things that I didn't mean to Kiss-Shot and hurt her.
126|I want to apologize in the hopes that she'll forgive me.
126|And then... I want to combat aberrations with her again.
126|Her divine beauty sends shivers down my spine.
126|I want to be the blade that protects her.
126|You probably have no eye for it.
126|Say what you want, but my impression is that you want to get close to Shinobu to enact your revenge.
126|Revenge? Revenge for what?
126|Do I have a reason to resent her?
126|A reason?
126|Yes.
126|Telling me you didn't mean what you said is a lie.
126|What you said to Shinobu was very cruel.
126|Yes, I don't deny that.
126|That's why I want to apologize.
126|I want to apologize directly.
126|She only needs one kin.
126|She revived me when I was on the brink of death.
126|It made me very bitter at the time, but now I'm grateful to her.
126|Does what I say sound that strange to you?
126|Using the word "bitter" is what's strange to me,
126|but I can't refute what you're saying
126|because I feel the exact same way.
126|Are you reluctant to break up?
126|Anybody could replace you, but nobody can replace me.
126|I am special, you see.
126|I'm the chosen human.
126|I love lines like that.
126|I wish I had a chance to say them.
126|Sadly, they're too presumptuous for me.
126|Nothing is gained by discord between us.
126|In the end, we are basically two men fighting over one woman.
126|Aberrations wouldn't meddle in a fight between their slaves.
126|What's going to happen now?
126|Will we be showering each other with praise?
126|That would be quite unsightly.
126|I'll show you the merits.
126|Araragi-dono, let me explain the positive outcomes once you break up with Kiss-Shot.
126|While I do that, try to think of the good things that can happen if you and Kiss-Shot don't break up.
126|The merits? The positives?
126|If you break up with Kiss-Shot, you would be released from her.
126|Think of it as me shouldering the responsibility of Kiss-Shot that has, until now, been borne by you.
126|I gave her your message.
126|I don't think she wants to
126|see you.
126|I see.
126|I'm not that surprised.
126|But whatever Kiss-Shot's feelings, I must have back what I gave away.
126|My sword...
126|And my position.
126|I want to try again.
126|I want to shine again after four hundred years.
126|I see nothing wrong with that.
126|Try what again? Being human, not her kin, right?
126|Even if your goal wasn't enacting revenge on her, perhaps you want to be human ag—
126|I can't go back to being human.
126|It's been four hundred years.
126|Too much time has passed.
126|I am different from you in that respect.

126|I don't like it in the least.

126|Kanbaru empathizes with the first aberration slayer more than any of us.
126|With that persistent feeling so much like pure love.
126|I have nothing to tell him even if we meet.
126|Accept reality, monkey girl.
126|He is largely responsible for the outbreak of aberrations in this town
126|and he will be hunted down by specialists.
126|I know!
126|That's why—
126|That's why? That's why I have to see him?
126|He hates me.
126|He might kill me.
126|He wants his demon sword back.
126|He might not be content with killing only me with it.
126|Take that into account, and—
126|You still have to see him!
126|Nobody cares about logic!
126|Why do people refuse to see others because of "logic"?
126|It solves nothing!
126|Unless you meet in person, nothing improves!
126|You can't create a story unless you talk!
126|Just say it, Shinobu-chan.
126|You're scared.
126|Scared of seeing him.
126|You don't want to be emotionally swayed by what he could say.
126|You think meeting him would be akin to cheating on Araragi-senpai,
126|so maybe you want to get it over with without meeting him,
126|but that's a mistake.
126|The only one you're cheating is yourself.
126|Just tell him.
126|Tell him that you can't be expected to hang on to his love for four hundred years!
126|Tell him that by reviving now, he endangers what you've built with Araragi-senpai!
126|Tell him that his love is a problem for you!
126|Tell him that he should have stayed in his grave!
126|Tell him.
126|If you can't do that, then don't lecture me about lords and masters.
126|You're being neither aloof nor noble.
126|You're just bad with people.
126|Don't give me that "master and servant."
126|You have the right to have neither slave nor master.
126|You don't have the right to build a relationship.
126|Why the romantic hand-holding?
126|Sorry. Thought you were Senjougahara.
126|You creep.
126|Wait just a moment, Ononoki-chan.
126|Why?
126|This is getting ugly.
126|Still.
126|Will those be your last words?
126|I really want to split your head open, even if it ruins everything.
126|Then do it.
126|I won't apologize.
126|Do it now and Araragi-senpai will be on bad terms with you.
126|You'd just avoid Araragi-senpai like how you avoid the first aberration slayer.
126|Just like you consigned him to the past,
126|you'd consign Araragi-senpai to some ancient fairy tale.
126|You'll throw away the second like you threw away the first.
126|How would you face the second when you can't face the first?
126|Number three, four, five—just keep breaking up forever!
126|Forever...
126|You're immortal, right?
126|I'm sure Araragi-senpai told you, Shinobu-chan,
126|that if you died tomorrow, he would go with you.
126|But you wouldn't say that.
126|Even if you said it, you'd tell the third the same.
126|And the fourth.
126|And the fifth.
126|You'd repeat it over and over
126|and still survive.
126|Not everyone is as sociable as you.
126|You called me shy earlier.
126|Not wanting to see someone is a perfectly natural emotion.
126|It's not natural.
126|Some people don't see eye to eye, but we have to see them anyway.
126|I'm not "people."
126|Perhaps.
126|It certainly looks like it.
126|I have nothing that I could tell him when we'd meet.
126|Our union ended in spite, and spite was the only thing uniting us in death.
126|I have no intention of patching things up or having the three of us get along together.
126|I have no intention of talking about them as equals.
126|Merely comparing the two is a disservice to my current master.
126|What good is there in showing my master my present harmony?
126|What good is there in showing my master no affection?
126|Are you saying that I should be so pointlessly cruel?
126|Yes, I'm saying that you should be cruel.
126|It's your job to hurt your old partner.
126|Do you want to be both a good person and loved by others?
126|Do you want to languish in love?
126|You're basically saying that things should be smashed before they fade.
126|Yes, I am, damn it!
126|If he still hates me and tries to kill me, I'd be forced to kill him.
126|Are you fine with that?
126|I am.
126|Provide a relief for his hatred.
126|You can end the cycle.
126|But if he apologizes and you forgive him...
126|The outcome is the same.
126|Once I forgive him, he will be exorcised by the specialists.
126|Would that be good?
126|It's good.
126|It's good!
126|If you are right and he's come back to life out of love for me, I won't respond to his feelings.
126|All I can render unto him is cruelty.
126|Would that be good?
126|It's good.
126|What if I meet him and, hypothetically, want to respond to his feelings?
126|What if I choose the first aberration slayer over your friend?
126|Would that be good?
126|It's good.
126|Break up with Araragi-senpai, properly,
126|and be united in eternity with the other.
126|That was the first time that I saw Oshino Shinobu surrender one on one.
126|Ononoki-chan, I want you to do something.
126|Can you take off this stamp?
126|I can't guarantee your safety if I take it off.
126|I want to try this duel thing.
126|Did you take care of the formalities?
126|Yes, of course.
126|She's very diligent about that.
126|She chased down the first aberration slayer and negotiated with him.
126|Where do we have this duel that you set up for us?
126|Where do I have to go tonight?
126|Oh, that.
126|You should be familiar with it.
126|I have some fateful attachments to it, too.
126|Fateful?
126|The grounds of Naoetsu Private High School.
126|After Kanbaru's thorough reprimand,
126|Shinobu decided to pout and go to sleep.
126|She hid in the shrine.
126|Having been obliterated by a high school girl must have gotten to her.
126|Huh? Kanbaru, what are you doing?
126|Why are you sleeping here?
126|You're bleeding on your head.
126|Are you okay?
126|Araragi-senpai, weren't you hiding over there? You know the answer.
126|You knew?!
126|Don't worry.
126|Shinobu-chan didn't notice.
126|So, Araragi-senpai, did you buy me my books?
126|Is that really the most important thing right now?
126|How important are they to you?
126|At least let me look at your head.
126|She'll be fine.
126|Let's have lunch, Kanbaru.
126|I'll just start reading now, Araragi-senpai, so feed me.
126|Don't "aahn" me.
126|What senpai would do that for their junior?
126|Where's Shinobu?
126|Oh, Araragi-senpai, the bra?
126|I bought it.
126|Here.
126|Bra
126|I'll just start reading now, Araragi-senpai, so put it on.
126|That "aahn"'s meaning changed a lot!
126|Kanbaru, by the way.
126|Do you have some death-defying advice for me, too?
126|I'd just say "DIY."
126|DIY?
126|Do Your Best.
126|Hang in there!
126|That would be abbreviated to "DYB."
126|Do-It-Yourselfer
126|DIY means Do It Yourself.
126|I decided against correcting her
126|because that advice perfectly fit the current situation.
126|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
126|I hear your laughter beyond the door
126|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
126|You were supposed to be with me forever
126|kyoushitsu no mado ni iki o haite kaita
126|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
126|namae o awatete sode de keshita
126|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
126|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara
126|I heard your voice from the hallway
126|kokoro gomakasu you ni hayaashi de kaetta
126|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
126|itsukaraka watashi wa kimi to
126|At some point I became unable
126|hanasenaku natta
126|to talk to you normally
126|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
126|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
126|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
126|You were supposed to be next to me forever
126|nani mo iwanakutatte
126|You knew how I felt
126|sugu kizuite kureta hito
126|even when I said nothing
126|nani yori taisetsu to kizuite mo mou
126|Now I know how important you were to me,
126|me mo awanai
126|but we will never see each other again
127|Hey, Senjougahara.
127|What is it?
127|I assume the problems you had earlier are resolved if you're calling me now.
127|Not really.
127|Sorry.
127|I just had to call you.
127|I felt alone.
127|I see.
127|Well, I'll take care of Hanekawa.
127|What happened to her?
127|Kanbaru didn't tell you?
127|Tell me what?
127|Just ask Hanekawa yourself once she's home, I guess.
127|Hey, Senjougahara.
127|There's something I want to know.
127|One year ago, when Kanbaru transferred into Naoetsu High School to see you...
127|What did you think of it?
127|Well...
127|Frankly, I thought it was a bit of a burden.
127|The strength of her feelings, I mean.
127|Conversely, you can think of it as proof that I was too shallow to appreciate her back then.
127|Being with her would have required me to be a better person.
127|I'm working on that, even now.
127|I still labor away
127|to become worthy enough to be your bride.
127|Is that a burden for you?
127|No, not at all.
127|Purity in Spirit
127|This might be our last chance, so can I ask you something that might upset you?
127|What would you do if someone confessed to you who was a better match than me?
127|I'd switch to him ten times out of ten.
127|You're amazing...
127|Amazingly blunt.
127|There are no absolutes in human relationships.
127|I learned that from watching my parents.
127|Senjougahara, what I meant was—
127|I'm actually a little scared when I try to imagine an unconditional bond.
127|I suggest you take this as encouragement to work on yourself so that I won't think of leaving.
127|You will never be special, but you can be special in the eyes of someone else.
127|Special in the eyes of someone else...
127|I toil incessantly to be special in the eyes of you and Kanbaru.
127|Don't be afraid, Araragi.
127|You are special
127|in my eyes and Kanbaru's.
127|In Shinobu's too.
127|We chose you.
127|You realized what I was getting at.
127|Amazing.
127|I'm your girlfriend.
127|I'm very happy you called me.
127|I love you.
127|When I get home, let us...
127|Let us talk more about this.
127|Yes.
127|I'll be waiting for you naked.
127|Kanbaru is really taking after you, huh?
127|End Story
127|Shinobu Mail Part Six
127|Let's get started and get this over with.
127|Come here.
127|That should do it.
127|We're all set up.
127|Araragi should be ready for battle as well.
127|All set up? That?
127|Please do wait.
127|What about the link, Sir Araragi?
127|Surely you do not intend to fight me as weak as you are.
127|He no longer had the voice he took from me.
127|He had his own back.
127|It seems your bond with Kiss-Shot is not as strong as I feared.
127|I can't believe she would send her servant to battle in such a state.
127|I don't want to win using Shinobu's help.
127|I want to win and help her.
127|Well, all right.
127|Lady Izuko, please think of a way to handicap me for this duel.
127|I will not abide any excuses.
127|No problem.
127|We will use a handicap well-employed throughout the ages.
127|You two should be on an even footing.
127|This is something like a virtual version of the demon sword Heart Span.
127|Of course, it does channel power.
127|It will easily stun either of you.
127|Please stand back-to-back now, with the bamboo sword between you.
127|I will count to ten and you will take a step forward each time.
127|On the tenth step, the duel begins.
127|The winner will be whoever whacks the other with the sword here.
127|If you can take the sword from your opponent and hit him, that's fine too.
127|What wins the duel is hitting the opponent once.
127|So, essentially,
127|your goal is not to make this fair, but to keep Araragi from dying.
127|You plan ahead.
127|Any other questions?
127|No, ma'am.
127|And you, Araragi?
127|Seeing as how I'm a novice to swordsmanship and combat,
127|can I at least be taught the best way to run those ten steps by a specialist?
127|By a specialist?
127|Sure.
127|I'm fine with adding that condition.
127|It's seven thirty right now, so...
127|Let's start at eight on the dot.
127|Combatants,
127|please commence your warm-up routine.
127|I'd estimate based on your height that you have a seventy-two centimeter stride.
127|Basically, seven meters, twenty centimeters after ten steps.
127|Just as there are different strategies for marathons and one-hundred meter sprints,
127|there are strategies for seven meter sprints too.
127|I think the problem will be how to conserve your energy.
127|Problem?
127|Just running there with all you've got isn't everything.
127|You still have to hit him once with the sword.
127|Right.
127|The important part of it is the fracas once you've grabbed the sword.
127|It would be a pity if he dodged your blow, stole the sword, and beat you up with it.
127|Uh, yeah, but...
127|You can't really plan for that.
127|I don't want to drag you into it.
127|All right. Will you at least borrow my shoes?
127|We have the same size.
127|Thanks.
127|What the hell?
127|What happened while I was skipping school?
127|Do you have an idea?
127|No, I don't...
127|Hanekawa was made homeless by fire,
127|and through Senjougahara's mediation she's been staying with Karen and Tsukihi at your house.
127|That's about all I can think of.
127|Well, that's probably it!
127|Hold on! Fire?
127|Homeless?
127|What?
127|Looks like she's heading for the climax.
127|What will you do, Koyomin?
127|Do you know something, Izuko?
127|Is Hanekawa—
127|I mean, do you know Hanekawa?
127|Also, what do you mean? What will I do?
127|I know everything.
127|It's a tiger, Koyomin.
127|The same tiger who ironically saved you in the cram school.
127|It looks like Tsubasa has resolved to face the large tiger that controls the flames of purgatory.
127|It's not just Tsubasa who's in trouble.
127|Your girlfriend Senjougahara is facing the same troubles.
127|What?
127|They might already be burning bright as we speak.
127|If you want to help them, you should go as soon as possible.
127|Abandon this pointless duel.
127|I would really like for you to forfeit.
127|It would be a problem if you died on me.
127|I can't break the rules myself, so you must do it.
127|Isn't this perfect for you too?
127|It gives you a plausible reason to stop this duel.
127|Choose, Koyomin.
127|Will you stay here for your futile duel?
127|Will you run to Tsubasa's and Senjougahara's aid?
127|Naoetsu Private High School
127|Will you choose Shinobu?
127|Will you choose Tsubasa?
127|Will you choose Senjougahara?
127|Which of the three do you like most?
127|Kanbaru, listen.
127|I'll do it!
127|You want me to run to your house, right?
127|Get Karen to let you in.
127|I'll be there soon.
127|Look through Tsubasa's things for me.
127|Orders received.
127|Are you quite sane?
127|It's unbelievable.
127|You really see only what's in front of you.
127|It's true that you might be able to respond to both situations if you send Kanbaru,
127|since she's a lot faster than you.
127|Tsubasa might even be able to handle it alone.
127|Since you are the only combatant here, being the only one to stay behind might be the correct decision.
127|But that's just theory.
127|People have feelings.
127|It looks to me like she sent you that text hoping you'd come.
127|Will you betray her trust?
127|They will never trust you again if you betray them now.
127|That may be.
127|But I should trust them.
127|I trust Hanekawa and Senjougahara from the bottom of my heart.
127|They are special to me, and will understand.
127|Hanekawa Tsubasa and
127|Senjougahara Hitagi will understand.
127|I trust that they understand that the man Araragi Koyomi prioritizes little girls over lovers and friends.
127|One day, I would like to trust others enough to give them my cell phone.
127|That's hilarious.
127|Is your master delivering your tools?
127|Or is this the winner's prize?
127|The winner gets the demon sword or something.
127|Perhaps.
127|Either way, the bamboo sword I prepared has been split cleanly in two.
127|You'll have to use the real one.
127|Koyomin, First One.
127|We have tarried, but let us begin now.
127|Do as arranged and stand back-to-back next to the sword.
127|She is clearly close, and yet my master, Kiss-Shot, does not show herself.
127|Is she that reluctant to meet me?
127|What do you think, Sir Araragi?
127|Is our quarrel, in the end, a grievance to her?
127|What does this duel mean to you, Sir Araragi?
127|You wouldn't understand what it means to me.
127|You are special, a chosen being.
127|Perhaps I'm not special or chosen.
127|Nobody can replace you,
127|and perhaps anybody could replace me.
127|But, you know.
127|You can never be me.
127|Countless could replace me,
127|but there is only one me.
127|You are not me,
127|and I am not you.
127|Isn't that all there is to it?
127|One.
127|One
127|Two.
127|Two
127|Three.
127|Three
127|Four.
127|Four
127|Five.
127|Five
127|Six.
127|Six
127|Seven.
127|Seven
127|Eight.
127|Eight
127|Nine.
127|Nine
127|Ten.
127|That's Meme's...
127|Oh, I see.
127|Count me surprised.
127|This is very unexpected.
127|This was certainly not what I meant when I said you had to hit the other once to win.
127|Kiss-Shot...
127|I don't know how long I will end up living.
127|But if we can meet again during my life...
127|If we can meet again,
127|then let us meet.
127|Don't apologize.
127|I forgive you.
127|I'm sorry too,
127|Seishirou.
127|Naoetsu Private High School
127|I'm glad I met you again.
127|I thought I'd never see you again.
127|But now we will never meet again.
127|There's someone who's more important to me than you now.
127|I want to be there for him for a while.
127|Four hundred years after the first attempt, his suicide was finally successful,
127|Naoetsu Private High School
127|without a fulfilling conclusion, without providing relief through honesty,
127|and without any kind of salvation.
127|Yes, very interesting.
127|And what happened then, Araragi?
127|What about the epilogue? The outcome?
127|The rest was told elsewhere.
127|I rendezvoused with my vanguard Kanbaru and met with Hanekawa and the tiger.
127|Reference
127|I went to Hanekawa and Kanbaru went to Senjougahara.
127|I see, I see.
127|Thank you very much, Araragi.
127|Now the puzzle has been filled in.
127|A few small parts contradict each other,
127|but making those coherent is part of what I enjoy as a listener.
127|Today is the 13th of March.
127|Later today I'll be taking my entrance exams.
127|I'll be going, then.
127|Let's meet again if we're still alive.
127|One more thing.
127|Did Shinobu eat her first kin in his entirety?
127|Uh, didn't I say that?
127|Without leaving anything behind?
127|Without leaving anything behind.
127|What about the armor?
127|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
127|She ate it... I think.
127|Maybe.
127|But...
127|Is that important?
127|Well, the armor is part of his flesh and blood, his bones.
127|If you melt it down, you can reforge it as another demon sword Heart Span.
127|In fact, ideally, as the short sword Dream Span.
127|Dream Span?
127|If I were Gaen, I would collect the armor, lest Shinobu eat it.
127|Maybe that's the real reason she called Episode.
127|She has no reason to do that.
127|I think Shinobu ate it at some point.
127|I think that's what happened.
127|Then let me answer one of your questions too.
127|My questions? Which are?
127|Shishirui Seishirou.
127|Shishirui Seishirou
127|That's the full name of the first oddity slayer.
127|Wouldn't you want to know the name of your rival in love?
127|I happened to overhear your conversation.
127|Again?
127|Don't worry. I avoided contact with her.
127|I clung to the ceiling as she passed underneath.
127|You're very soft on her, aren't you?
127|Don't you tell her too much?
127|Really?
127|I don't think so.
127|If you say so.
127|I was on my way to the Shrine of the Polar Snake.
127|Want to tag along?
127|Where's that?
127|Don't forget it.
127|You forget too much.
127|It's where your master went missing.
127|It's too early in the morning for a date with you.
127|But I have a question for you too.
127|Which is?
127|Are you happy that you became a vampire?
127|Didn't the first oddity slayer talk about that?
127|Didn't he ask you whether there was a good reason for him to let you stay with her?
127|You weren't able to give him a good reason to stay with her then,
127|but maybe that has changed.
127|Do you still believe nobody is made happier if you are with Shinobu?
127|I still think so.
127|Nobody becomes happy.
127|Nobody can become happy.
127|If I am a vampire, if I am with Shinobu, it only imposes a burden on others.
127|Shinobu most of all.
127|That sounds like excuses to me.
127|It sounds to me like you're telling me to leave you alone because you won't be happy and aren't trying to be.
127|It sounds like you're pleading for sympathy because of your own misfortune.
127|You know...
127|Are you one of those people who think wallowing in unhappiness and bad luck is the same as toughing it out?
127|Most people just call it "apathy."
127|Misfortune isn't a valid excuse.
127|You have to shoot for the happy ending.
127|Shall I step on your face again?
127|You're so hard on me, Ononoki.
127|Languishing in unhappiness is simply negligence.
127|Not trying to be happy is for cowards.
127|It won't redeem your dead predecessor either.
127|I'll remember that.
127|Nobody is happy.
127|Not me.
127|Not Shinobu.
127|No one.
127|For now, that's what I think—
127|That's what I still think.
127|But perhaps, a long time from now,
127|maybe about four hundred years, my thoughts on the matter could change.
127|Stop
127|20
127|I may not be happy, but happily enough we still have much time.
127|Time to live, time to think.
127|Beware of Rail Crossing
127|Enough time for corpses to rot away and turn into dust.
127|That this time would come to an end was, perhaps, only a matter of time as well.
127|I hear your laughter beyond the door
127|You were supposed to be with me forever
127|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
127|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
127|I heard your voice from the hallway
127|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
127|At some point I became unable
127|to talk to you normally
127|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
127|You were supposed to be next to me forever
127|You knew how I felt
127|even when I said nothing
127|Now I know how important you were to me,
127|but we will never see each other again
128|Hey, Senjougahara.
128|What is it?
128|I assume that the problems you had earlier are resolved if you're calling me now.
128|It's still not over.
128|Sorry.
128|I just had to call you.
128|I felt alone.
128|I see.
128|Well, Hanekawa-san is under my care.
128|What happened to her?
128|Kanbaru didn't tell you?
128|Tell me what?
128|Just ask Hanekawa yourself once she's home, I guess.
128|Hey, Senjougahara.
128|There's something that I want to know.
128|One year ago, when Kanbaru transferred into Naoetsu High School to see you...
128|What did you think of it?
128|Well...
128|Frankly, I thought it was a bit of a burden.
128|The strength of her feelings, I mean.
128|Conversely, you can think of it as proof that I was too shallow to appreciate her back then.
128|Being with Kanbaru would have required me to be a better person.
128|I'm working on that even now.
128|I still labor away, Araragi-kun,
128|to become worthy enough to be your bride.
128|Is that a burden for you?
128|No, not at all.
128|Purity in Spirit
128|This might be our last chance, so can I ask you something that might upset you?
128|What would you do if someone confessed to you who was a better match than me?
128|I'd switch to him one hundred percent of the time.
128|You're amazing...
128|Amazingly blunt.
128|There are no absolutes in human relationships.
128|I learned that from watching my parents.
128|Senjougahara, what I meant was—
128|I'm actually a little scared when I try to imagine an unconditional bond.
128|I suggest you take this as encouragement to work on yourself so that I won't think of leaving.
128|You will never be special, but you can be special in the eyes of someone else.
128|Special in the eyes of someone else...
128|To be special in the eyes of you, Araragi-kun, and Kanbaru, I toil incessantly.
128|Don't be afraid, Araragi-kun.
128|You are a special person
128|in my eyes and in Kanbaru's.
128|In Shinobu-chan's, too.
128|We chose you.
128|You realized what I was getting at.
128|Amazing.
128|I'm your girlfriend.
128|I'm very happy that you called me.
128|I love you.
128|When I get home, let's...
128|Let's talk more about this.
128|Yes.
128|I'll be waiting for you naked.
128|Kanbaru's becoming a pervert from your influence, huh?
128|Du bist alles
128|You are everything
128|Ich kann dich hören
128|I can hear you
128|rufe meinen Namen
128|call my name
128|und wieder und wieder
128|and again and again
128|Ich kann dich hören
128|I can hear you
128|für immer und ewig
128|forever and ever
128|mein Schatz
128|my treasure
128|Owarimonogatari
128|Shinobu Mail Part Six
128|Let's get started and get this over with.
128|Come here.
128|That should do it.
128|We're all set up.
128|Araragi-kun should be ready for battle as well.
128|Ready? That's ready?
128|Please do wait.
128|What about the link, Araragi-dono?
128|Surely you do not intend to fight me as weak as you are.
128|He no longer had the voice he took from me.
128|He had his own back.
128|It seems that your bond with Kiss-Shot is not as strong as I feared.
128|I can't believe she would send her servant to battle in such a state.
128|I don't want to win using Shinobu's strength.
128|I want to win and become Shinobu's strenth.
128|Well, all right.
128|Izuko-dono, please think of a way to handicap me for this duel.
128|I will not abide any excuses.
128|No problem.
128|We will use a handicap well-employed throughout the ages.
128|You two should be on an even footing.
128|This is something like a virtual version of the demon sword Heart Span.
128|Of course, it does channel power.
128|It will easily stun either of you.
128|Please stand back-to-back with the bamboo sword between you.
128|I will count to ten and you will take a step forward each time.
128|On the tenth step, the duel begins.
128|The winner will be the one to whack the other with the sword here.
128|If you can take the sword from your opponent and hit him, that's fine, too.
128|What wins the duel is hitting the opponent once.
128|So, essentially,
128|your goal is not to make this fair but to keep Araragi-dono from dying.
128|You plan ahead.
128|Any other questions?
128|None.
128|Araragi-kun, and you?
128|Seeing as how I'm a novice to swordsmanship and combat,
128|can I at least be taught the best way to run those ten steps by a specialist?
128|By a specialist?
128|Okay.
128|I'm fine with adding that condition.
128|It's seven thirty right now, so...
128|Let's start at eight on the dot.
128|Combatants,
128|please commence your warm-up routine.
128|I'd estimate based on your height, Araragi-senpai, that you have a seventy-two centimeter stride.
128|Basically, seven meters, twenty centimeters after ten steps.
128|Marathons have marathon strategies, hundred meter sprints have hundred meter sprint strategies,
128|and seven meter sprints have seven meter sprint strategies as well.
128|I think the problem will be conserving your energy.
128|Problem?
128|Just running there with all you've got isn't everything.
128|You still have to hit him once with the sword.
128|Right.
128|The important part of it is the fracas once you've grabbed the sword.
128|It would be a pity if he dodged your blow, stole the sword, and beat you up with it.
128|Uh, yeah, but...
128|You can't really plan for that.
128|I don't want to drag you into it.
128|All right. Will you at least borrow my shoes?
128|We have the same size.
128|Thanks.
128|What the hell?
128|What happened while I was skipping school?
128|Kanbaru, do you have an idea?
128|No, I don't...
128|A fire made Hanekawa-senpai homeless
128|and through Senjougahara-senpai's mediation she's been staying with Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan at your house.
128|That's about all I can think of.
128|Well, that's probably it!
128|Hold on! Fire?
128|Homeless?
128|What kind of story is this?
128|Looks like she's heading for the climax.
128|What will you do, Koyomin?
128|Izuko-san, do you know something?
128|Is Hanekawa—
128|I mean, do you know Hanekawa?
128|Also, what do you mean? What will I do?
128|I know everything.
128|It's a tiger, Koyomin.
128|The same tiger who ironically saved you in the cram school.
128|It looks like Tsubasa-chan has resolved to face the large tiger that controls the flames of purgatory.
128|It's not just Tsubasa-chan who's in a pinch.
128|Your girlfriend Senjougahara-san is in the same pinch.
128|What?
128|They might already be burning bright as we speak.
128|If you want to help them, you should go as soon as possible.
128|Abandon this pointless duel.
128|I would really like for you to forfeit.
128|It would be a problem if you died on me.
128|I can't break the rules myself, so you must do it.
128|Koyomin, isn't this perfect for you?
128|It gives you a plausible reason to stop this duel.
128|Choose, Koyomin.
128|Will you stay here for your futile duel?
128|Do Tsubasa-chan and Senjougahara-san demand your immediate attention?
128|Naoetsu Private High School
128|Is Shinobu-chan your choice?
128|Is Tsubasa-chan your choice?
128|Is Senjougahara-san your choice?
128|Which of the three do you like most?
128|Kanbaru, listen.
128|I'll do it!
128|Araragi-senpai, you want me to run to your house, right?
128|Get Karen to let you in.
128|I'll be there soon.
128|Look through her things for me.
128|Orders received.
128|Are you quite sane?
128|It's unbelievable.
128|You really see only what's in front of you.
128|It's true that you might be able to respond to both situations if you send Kanbaru Suruga-san
128|because she's a lot faster than you.
128|Tsubasa-chan might even be able to handle it alone.
128|Because you are the only combatant here, being the only one to stay behind might be the correct decision.
128|But that's just theory.
128|People have feelings.
128|It looks to me like she sent you that text hoping you'd come.
128|Will you betray her trust?
128|They will never trust you again if you betray them now.
128|That may be.
128|But I should trust them.
128|I trust Hanekawa and Senjougahara from the bottom of my heart.
128|They are special to me, and will understand.
128|Hanekawa Tsubasa and
128|Senjougahara Hitagi will understand.
128|I trust that they understand that the man Araragi Koyomi prioritizes little girls over lovers and friends.
128|One day, I would like to trust others enough to give them my cell phone.
128|That's hilarious.
128|Is your master delivering your tools?
128|Or is this the winner's prize?
128|The winner gets the demon sword or something.
128|Perhaps.
128|Either way, the bamboo sword that I prepared has been split cleanly in two.
128|You'll have to use the real one.
128|Koyomin. First One.
128|We have tarried, but let us begin now.
128|Do as arranged and stand back-to-back next to the sword.
128|She is clearly close, and yet my master, Kiss-Shot, does not show herself.
128|Is Kiss-Shot that reluctant to meet me?
128|Araragi-dono, what do you think?
128|Is our quarrel, to Kiss-Shot, ultimately a grievance?
128|Araragi-dono, what does this duel mean to you?
128|You wouldn't understand what it means to me.
128|You are special, a chosen being.
128|Perhaps I'm not special or chosen.
128|Nobody can replace you,
128|and perhaps anybody could replace me.
128|But, you know.
128|You can never be me.
128|Countless could replace me,
128|but there is only one me.
128|You are not me
128|and I am not you.
128|Isn't that all there is to it?
128|One.
128|One
128|Two.
128|Two
128|Three.
128|Three
128|Four.
128|Four
128|Five.
128|Five
128|Six.
128|Six
128|Seven.
128|Seven
128|Eight.
128|Eight
128|Nine.
128|Nine
128|Ten.
128|That's Meme's...
128|Oh, I see.
128|Count me surprised.
128|This is very unexpected.
128|This was certainly not what I meant when I said you had to hit the other once to win.
128|Kiss-Shot... Kiss-Shot... Kiss-Shot...
128|Kiss-Shot... Kiss-Shot...
128|I don't know how long I will end up living.
128|But if we can meet again during my life...
128|If we can meet again,
128|then let us meet.
128|Don't apologize.
128|I forgive you.
128|I'm sorry, too,
128|Seishirou.
128|Naoetsu Private High School
128|I'm glad I met you again.
128|I thought I'd never see you again.
128|But now we will never meet again.
128|There's someone who's more important to me than you now.
128|I want to be there for him for a while.
128|Four hundred years after the first attempt, his suicide was finally successful,
128|Naoetsu Private High School
128|without a fulfilling conclusion, without providing relief through honesty,
128|and without any kind of salvation.
128|Okay then.
128|And what happened then, Araragi-senpai?
128|What about the epilogue? The outcome?
128|The rest was told elsewhere.
128|I rendezvoused with my vanguard Kanbaru and met with Hanekawa and the tiger.
128|Reference
128|I went to Hanekawa and Kanbaru went to Senjougahara.
128|I see, I see.
128|Thank you very much, Araragi-senpai.
128|Now the final puzzle piece is in place.
128|A few small parts contradict each other,
128|but making those coherent is part of what I, Oshino Ougi enjoy as a listener.
128|Today is the 13th of March.
128|Later today, I'll take my entrance exams.
128|I'll be going, then.
128|Let's meet again if we're still alive.
128|One more thing.
128|Did Shinobu-san eat her first kin in his entirety?
128|Uh, didn't I say that?
128|Without leaving anything behind?
128|Without leaving anything behind.
128|What about the armor?
128|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
128|She ate it... I think.
128|Maybe.
128|But...
128|Is that important?
128|Well, the armor is part of his flesh and blood, his bones.
128|If you melt it down, you can reforge it as another demon sword Heart Span.
128|In fact, ideally, as the short sword Dream Span.
128|Dream Span?
128|If I were Gaen-san, I would collect the armor, lest Shinobu-san eat it.
128|Maybe that's the real reason why she called Episode-kun.
128|Gaen-san has no reason to do that.
128|I think Shinobu ate it at some point.
128|I think that's what happened.
128|Then let me answer one of your questions as well, Araragi-senpai.
128|My questions? Which are?
128|Shishirui Seishirou.
128|Shishirui Seishirou
128|That's the full name of the first aberration slayer.
128|Araragi-senpai, wouldn't you want to know the name of your rival in love?
128|I happened to overhear your conversation.
128|Again?
128|Don't worry. I avoided contact with her.
128|I clung to the ceiling as she passed underneath.
128|Devil-chan, you're very soft on her, aren't you?
128|Don't you tell her too much?
128|Really?
128|I don't think so.
128|If you say so, devil-chan.
128|I was on my way to the North Shirahebi Shrine.
128|Want to tag along?
128|Where's that?
128|Don't forget it.
128|You forget too much.
128|It's where your master went missing.
128|It's too early in the morning for a date with you.
128|But I have a question for you, too.
128|Which is?
128|Are you happy that you became a vampire, devil-chan?
128|Didn't the first aberration slayer talk about that?
128|Devil-chan, didn't he ask you whether there was a good reason for him to let you stay with Shinobu-sensei?
128|Devil-chan, you weren't able to give him a good reason to stay with her then,
128|but maybe that has changed.
128|Do you still believe nobody is made happier if you are with Shinobu-sensei?
128|I still think so.
128|Nobody becomes happy.
128|Nobody can become happy.
128|If I am a vampire, if I am with Shinobu, it only imposes a burden on others.
128|Shinobu most of all.
128|Those sound like excuses to me.
128|It sounds to me like you're telling me to leave you alone because you won't be happy and aren't trying to be.
128|It sounds like you're pleading for sympathy because of your own misfortune.
128|You know, devil-chan...
128|Are you one of those people who think wallowing in unhappiness and bad luck is the same as toughing it out?
128|Most people just call it "apathy."
128|Misfortune isn't a valid excuse.
128|You have to shoot for the happy ending.
128|Shall I step on your face again?
128|You're so hard on me, Ononoki-chan.
128|Languishing in unhappiness is simply negligence.
128|Not trying to be happy is for cowards.
128|It won't redeem your dead predecessor, either.
128|I'll remember that.
128|Nobody is happy.
128|Not me.
128|Not Shinobu.
128|No one.
128|For now, that's what I think—
128|That's what I still think.
128|But perhaps, a long time from now,
128|maybe about four hundred years, my thoughts on the matter could change.
128|Stop
128|20
128|I may not be happy, but happily enough, we still have much time.
128|Time to live, time to think.
128|Beware of Rail Crossing
128|Enough time for corpses to rot away and turn into dust.
128|That this time would come to an end was, perhaps, only a matter of time as well.
128|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
128|I hear your laughter beyond the door
128|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
128|You were supposed to be with me forever
128|kyoushitsu no mado ni iki o haite kaita
128|I breathed onto the classroom window and wrote your name
128|namae o awatete sode de keshita
128|only to panic and wipe it with my sleeve
128|rouka kara kimi no koe ga shitekara
128|I heard your voice from the hallway
128|kokoro gomakasu you ni hayaashi de kaetta
128|and went home in hurry to hide my feelings
128|itsukaraka watashi wa kimi to
128|At some point I became unable
128|hanasenaku natta
128|to talk to you normally
128|mukou de kimi no warai goe ga kikoeru
128|I can hear your laughter beyond the door
128|zutto tonari ni ita hazu no koe
128|You were supposed to be next to me forever
128|nani mo iwanakutatte
128|You knew how I felt
128|sugu kizuite kureta hito
128|even when I said nothing
128|nani yori taisetsu to kizuite mo mou
128|Now I know how important you were to me,
128|me mo awanai
128|but we will never see each other again
129|Ononoki Yotsugi is a doll.
129|Therefore you can also say that she's not human.
129|She's not a person,
129|not a living being,
129|not normal.
129|Ononoki Yotsugi exists as an artifact spirit used as a familiar.
129|She might look like a cute little girl.
129|She might seem an emotionless girl amusing those around her with her eccentricity,
129|while looking like an expressionless child,
129|Do Not Enter
129|because her true nature is that of an oddity,
129|that of a demon,
129|a monster,
129|a sort of evil nature spirit.
129|Bee
129|Cat
129|Snake
129|Monkey
129|Snail
129|Vampire
129|Crab
129|Phoenix
129|Evil Nature Spirit
129|It is because of this that she finds herself fundamentally at odds with human society.
129|No, I don't think that's quite right, my master.
129|Her case is different.
129|She's an animated human corpse, a doll.
129|She's made to resemble human beings.
129|It's mimicry.
129|If that's the case,
129|then does that mean that she's trying to both be and become human?
129|As I ponder the question, it occurs to me that Shinobu's answer is different.
129|That she is imitating human beings is already proof that she isn't trying to be human.
129|Even if these are attempts to blend into human society...
129|Even if they're attempts to coexist...
129|They're not attempts to assimilate.
129|Studying a foreign language and speaking it fluently only proves that one is trying to communicate with others,
129|and hardly proof that they're trying to change their nationality.
129|It's the same thing.
129|Being made to imitate human beings wasn't an attempt to make her human, or allow her to become one.
129|It was to allow her to live alongside them.
129|She's not meant to be one thing or the other.
129|She's only meant to exist.
129|In order to forge friendly relations with someone in another culture, one must first seek to understand that culture—
129|When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
129|And besides, my master.
129|Have you never asked yourself why oddities, which are basically legends of ghostly apparitions,
129|appear as humans or animals to us?
129|They are immaterial creatures, and yet they use real creatures as their base to appear.
129|I'd never asked myself that.
129|Perhaps it's simply due to the limits of human imagination...
129|People can only use their own vocabulary to describe reality...
129|Ultimately, humans are the ones that make her, as an oddity, what she is.
129|Don't take this to mean that human beings are essential to oddities.
129|Without the observer, the observed has no shape.
129|There are legends about me being a great vampire,
129|but without those legends I might as well not even be one.
129|An oddity without a story about it
129|is no oddity.
129|Stories about oddities have to be odd.
129|But I suppose that has more to do with that unpleasant man in the Hawaiian shirt's values and mindset than it does with mine.
129|In short, what defines oddities is the attitude towards them.
129|Attitude. Feelings.
129|Perhaps it's similar to assigning humanlike qualities to a doll.
129|That is how artifact spirits and other unsettling beings come to be.
129|That divinity resides in all creation,
129|that countless spirits possess all existence...
129|Such beliefs are said to be uniquely Japanese,
129|but assigning humanlike qualities to something not human
129|without making the distinction between the animate and the inanimate is common throughout the world.
129|That's why stories about oddities exist all over the world.
129|Stories told
129|by human beings.
129|I agreed with that explanation.
129|No, I had no choice but to agree,
129|for I myself have told many stories about oddities.
129|Stories about vampires.
129|Stories about cats.
129|Stories about crabs.
129|Stories about snails.
129|Stories about monkeys.
129|Stories about snakes.
129|Stories about bees.
129|Stories about phoenices.
129|Having talked about them all, how could I not agree?
129|And now I find myself about to talk about a doll,
129|but I can't help but feel like I've already talked more than enough.
129|Consider urban legends, rumors on the street, or secondhand information.
129|When too much is said, it all becomes idle chatter.
129|The terror and gravity of the story fades away.
129|When I consider the strange darkness that I first saw on the first day of my second term
129|and the matter of Sengoku Nadeko and the snake god,
129|I find myself wondering when there will be an end to all this.
129|So many oddities have appeared now
129|that it has become difficult for me to maintain the right facade.
129|It fills me with genuine despair.
129|These thoughts are meaningless.
129|There will never be an end.
129|I should know that the world isn't that benign.
129|No, I'm not obligated to do anything by now.
129|There is a final page in every story.
129|Don't act like your eventful days are over just yet.
129|People always say that,
129|but there will be an end to that as well.
129|I know there is because I'm the one telling this story.
129|It was an experience forced upon me.
129|This is the beginning of the end.
129|The beginning of the end in the story of Araragi Koyomi.
129|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
129|as the stars twinkle above
129|Yotsugi Doll
129|I guess this is enough for me
129|I'm sure there's a reason
129|There's more to this world
129|than the things I can see
129|The reason you laugh
129|is my reason to cry
129|Getting logical and serious about this won't let us take another step
129|I'll make a wish upon that shooting star
129|Too bad I'm not sure anymore
129|what I want for the future
129|That's how we pass our days
129|Let's go to bed and to hell with making sense
129|My heart pounds
129|when I eat this sparkling orange mint
129|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
129|as the stars twinkle above
129|Brother, it's morning!
129|You gotta wake up!
129|This morning I suddenly had the urge to think about alarm clocks.
129|Frankly, I neither like the word alarm clock nor their mere existence.
129|<Content Omitted>
129|I can't deny that I'm something of a Luddite in this respect,
129|but much more fundamentally, I question the need to wake up in the first place.
129|That vague feeling of dislike is connected to the clock—
129|<Content Omitted>
129|When I repeat this word—
129|Alarm clock.
129|Clock of alarm.
129|Clarm alock.
129|<Content Omitted>
129|I feel a sort of maddening pressure emanating from the word "alarm," so—
129|<Content Omitted>
129|So let us say this to the alarm clock, without hate, but with gratitude:
129|Thank you, and good night.
129|Don't sleep!
129|Being sleepy is no excuse to stay in bed.
129|Besides, we're not alarm clocks. We're your sisters.
129|Alarm sisters.
129|That looks funny.
129|I hope they bring out figures of this.
129|All right, I'm up.
129|I've awakened.
129|February 13th, huh?
129|Tomorrow's Valentine's Day.
129|Hey, girls.
129|Got some chocolate for me tomorrow?
129|Anyway, this ain't the time to worry about Valentine's Day.
129|You know that, right?
129|Remember how you only have a month left until the university entrance exams?
129|Do you understand?
129|Do you understand you're better off dead if you don't understand? I'll kill you myself.
129|I don't think anybody's ever told me that before.
129|Nothing about killing me, either.
129|Good grief.
129|This is why you're trash.
129|Get up and study.
129|Devote yourself.
129|True, it's time for the finishing touches.
129|I don't think it's time to devote myself to anything, though.
129|Besides, you're one to talk.
129|If you don't keep up, you'll have to go to a different high school.
129|Worry about yourself.
129|I'll tickle you.
129|Tickle, tickle.
129|You're out of luck.
129|The skin is under my feet is callused from training.
129|I'll lick it then.
129|Whether any licking actually occurred, or whether Karen pulled her foot away before it could be licked, is concealed to protect our familial privacy.
129|Secret
129|You look fine now.
129|I'll go running, then.
129|Arunning.
129|Prepare the bath for me.
129|Make it hot enough to burn me.
129|Why don't you run with me?
129|I couldn't keep up with you.
129|You run like a sprinter.
129|And you do it for a whole marathon.
129|42.195 kilometers!
129|Go run with Kanbaru!
129|Goodbye then, grandpa!
129|All right.
129|Let's get her bath ready.
129|I will set time aside early in the morning, work my mortal shell hard, exert myself, and prepare her bath.
129|What a condescending sentence.
129|The sub-clauses were all broadly similar.
129|With the way she trains herself, she looks like a sword blade,
129|but someone as sharp as I has to wonder why she doesn't join a club.
129|She can't join a club.
129|The sad fate of the karate student!
129|No club activities!
129|Only real combat!
129|Seriously real combat!
129|And stuff!
129|Comprende?!
129|Nah.
129|On that note, Tsukihi, don't you think it's a waste to keep her talent hidden from the world?
129|She may not be as impressive as I am, but there's no denying she's brimming with talent.
129|Don't you think she'd be a shoo-in if she participated in a talent show?
129|Unrestrained by dojos and the fire sisters!
129|We could put her up to competing in the Olympi—
129|Ouch!
129|What the hell are you doing?!
129|Why are you upset? You were being annoying.
129|No mercy for anyone who tries to break apart the Fire Sisters. Not even for you.
129|I know you've been considering going your separate ways.
129|Didn't you say you'd invite me to a farewell party chock-full of hot middle school girls?
129|Hearing it from other people still makes me angry.
129|Well, I don't need someone like you to tell me Karen will someday retire from the Fire Sisters.
129|She's going to have her hands full when she goes to high school.
129|Hands full of high school.
129|Her environment will change and all.
129|That said, I highly doubt she'll stop going to her dojo.
129|She adores her master.
129|There's still some time until we find out how I fail my entrance exams,
129|and exactly what kind of hilarious failure they will turn out to be,
129|but at least for the time being, it seems clear that my personal situation is going to change and not Karen's.
129|For now, let's talk about Karen and Tsukihi.
129|Very surprisingly, I must concur,
129|I feel that as their loving brother it is my duty to provide them with a measure of stability.
129|Yes.
129|We must all wake up to reality now. The Fire Sisters.
129|And I, too.
129|I'm going to make the water as hot as she likes it.
129|I really started wanting to take a bath too.
129|Brother!
129|Your abs...
129|Your abs
129|I mean, you're absolutely the worst!
129|You're absolutely the worst!
129|First you said you'd prepare the bath for her, and now you're trying to get in first.
129|You're the worst!
129|The worst!
129|When I look at you and that immodest appearance,
129|why, I can't help but come to the conclusion you had the same plan.
129|Just get out of the way, Brother.
129|I'm taking a bath now.
129|You may be my brother, but if you shan't let me pass, this will not end well.
129|Hearken, little sister!
129|If you truly wish to enter the bath, you must do so over my dead b—
129|That's dangerous!
129|What are you doing?
129|Turning you into a corpse.
129|If thou wisheth to pass—
129|Okay, fine.
129|Brother, let us take the middle ground.
129|The middle ground?
129|Let's take the middle ground and both take a bath.
129|Why?
129|Shut the hell up. You're too young to even know what you're talking about. I bet you're just too chicken to take a bath with your big brother."
129|"
129|This is taking place in the normal-sized bathroom of a normal-sized home, rather than a cavernous hall of a room like the one designed for the anime, so...
129|Brother...
129|Yes, my sister?
129|Please say something.
129|This is more awkward than I'd hoped.
129|If this is awkward for you, just get out, Tsukihi.
129|You have a really vain streak.
129|If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
129|And if you play with fire, you tend to get burned!
129|I was talking about how awkward looking at your emaciated frame is.
129|Being together in the bath with you does nothing for me.
129|It's a completely asexual experience!
129|In fact, I want to get out as fast as possible since you can't stop slipping those looks at my body in.
129|I want to slip on out of here, even.
129|Did you deliberately slip that in there? Or no?
129|I know that deep down you lust for my body.
129|You want to touch my abs. I know it.
129|I would never want to touch those eight clearly defined muscles.
129|Don't count my muscles.
129|Just don't count them.
129|Are you peeking at them?
129|Aren't you the one peeking at my breasts?
129|Hell would sooner freeze over.
129|This isn't my first time seeing what you call breasts anyway.
129|Isn't that, like, really wrong?
129|Why would a normal brother have seen his sister's breasts?
129|And boy, how I know them!
129|Those two meatballs!
129|Don't call them that!
129|You sound like you're talking about barbecue!
129|Look, Brother.
129|Let's wash our hair individually.
129|There's too much hair otherwise.
129|Washing it side by side is inefficient.
129|Uneconomical.
129|I don't think economy has anything to do with it.
129|She does have a point.
129|But, Tsukihi, if washing our hair side by side is not acceptable,
129|what do you propose exactly when you say "individually"?
129|Something like this!
129|I'll wash your hair, just like this.
129|This was as much the shock of realization as the shock of a sudden touch.
129|Bubbles, bubbles.
129|It's standing!
129|Astro Brother!
129|Super Brother!
129|Am I a Super Saiyan now?
129|I'll wash it off.
129|Let me wash your body too.
129|Brother! Brother!
129|What is it?
129|I can clearly tell you had an idea that you think is just fantastic.
129|I thought of an amazing joke.
129|It's legendary!
129|Huh.
129|That kind of worries me.
129|Here, turn around.
129|Come on.
129|Title: To Catch a Predator.
129|What are you doing?!
129|Maybe a more metaphorical position would have been putting my hands above my head to mimic the Skytree.
129|I think Karen might do a better job, though—
129|Turn around.
129|I'll wash your body now.
129|Bubbles, bubbles.
129|Tsukihi...
129|Maybe you're trying to have your wish granted or something, but why don't you at least cut your bangs?
129|When I cut around on the edges my hair starts getting into my eyes and it really stings.
129|No matter how much you love your hair, it still stings when it gets into your eyes.
129|Okay.
129|Speaking of bangs.
129|Nadeko is out of the hospital now.
129|I see.
129|That's good.
129|Huh?
129|That's a more lukewarm reaction than I expected.
129|I thought you'd start a little dance right here.
129|Uh-huh.
129|That's all I could say.
129|That's all I had the right to say.
129|But I'm glad she's out of the hospital.
129|I don't expect I'll ever meet her again, of course.
129|I'm still glad for her.
129|At least by now I can be.
129|Brother!
129|What?
129|Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
129|Why are you hurting my hurting head like a hurting vise set to maximum hurt.
129|Oh, sorry about that.
129|Seems I was too forceful.
129|Hey, Brother.
129|I'm sure I'm the last person you want to hear this from,
129|and that's also precisely why I'm saying it,
129|but aren't you shouldering a bit much lately?
129|You're too forceful.
129|What happened to Nadeko was beyond your ability.
129|She pretends to know what she's talking about,
129|but Tsukihi has very little idea
129|of what really happened when Nadeko was missing.
129|Just go check up on her one of these days.
129|She's recuperating at home.
129|After your exams is fine, I guess.
129|Now that she's no longer missing, now that Sengoku Nadeko has come down the mountain...
129|I mean, I'm happy for her.
129|I truly am,
129|but simultaneously it means this city is once more at supernatural peril.
129|And while nobody fixes that,
129|or even does something to alleviate it appreciably,
129|the problems will continue.
129|Leaving my sisters and the city in this state to depart for other places bothers me quite a bit.
129|It wouldn't have to be an absolutely perfect solution.
129|Finding some kind of balance would help.
129|Balance, huh?
129|That was never in my job description.
129|No, it wasn't.
129|Like I said, you shoulder too much.
129|There's no way you could solve every single problem.
129|I really think it's fine to leave some things to other people and understand the limitations of one's own ability.
129|You worry too much about Nadeko, Karen, and me, too.
129|So, Brother.
129|How are your studies going exactly?
129|Is it enough to study for a month?
129|I guess?
129|Was the only answer I could give.
129|Even if it wasn't, I couldn't say anything else.
129|What a pitiful self-delusion.
129|It's time to burden yourself with knowledge, not duties.
129|You should listen to me.
129|Do you really have time to wash your sister?
129|Well, I'm not doing this because I have a duty or some such to bathe you.
129|Don't take that to mean I'm doing it to fondle you, either.
129|Besides, the fundamental problem here is something else.
129|Even if we make the best of the available space and wash each other in turn,
129|the bathtub remains as cozy as ever.
129|Yeah, it wasn't a bad idea per se,
129|but bathing with the blonde girl was already pretty difficult,
129|and it will be even harder with a middle schooler.
129|The blonde girl?
129|Never mind!
129|You heard nothing!
129|More!
129|More! More!
129|Let's have fun!
129|I could see Tsukihi's naked shape in the mirror.
129|That was perfectly normal and according to expectation.
129|However, other things were unnatural.
129|Nay.
129|Other things were exceedingly unnatural.
129|My own shape, the shape of Araragi Koyomi, was nowhere in the cheval glass.
129|The mirror did not show him.
129|Just as one would expect of the immortal oddity called vampire.
129|How much longer, do you think,
129|can we live our ordinary lives like this?
129|Perhaps that thought alone
129|invites the end of it
129|I blame my misfortune on little things in life
129|instead of taking a step forward
129|You had to be gone from my life
129|before I started treasuring my days
129|I always tell myself that my time is limited,
129|but could never confess my love
129|Even if our days together are over,
129|I will find happiness again
129|Now I know that my time is limited,
129|and so I want to confess my love
130|The Worst
130|Ononoki Yotsugi is a doll.
130|To put it differently, she isn't human.
130|Not a person. Not a living thing. She isn't ordinary.
130|That is Ononoki Yotsugi... A tsukumo-gami that serves as a shikigami.
130|She looks like a cute little girl, eccentric in speech and actions.
130|Though she is an amusing and expressionless child, her true nature is that of an aberration.
130|A demon. A monster. She's that kind of being.
130|Crab
130|Bird
130|Bee
130|Cat
130|Snake
130|Monkey
130|Snail
130|Devil
130|Evil Spirits
130|Because of that, she doesn't fit in with human society well.
130|No. You know, that's not really the case, master.
130|In her case.
130|She was born from a human's corpse, she's a doll...
130|and she looks like a human. She pretends to be a human being.
130|Does that...
130|Does that mean that she's striving to be human, that she's doing her best to try and be human?
130|If so, I wonder...
130|But, according to Shinobu, that's not quite right.
130|Apparently the fact that she pretends to be human is proof that she isn't trying.
130|In The End, It Is Merely The Means To Blend Into Human Society.
130|It Is Only A Means To Become Compatible.
130|So Therefore Not A Means To Assimilate.
130|No matter how much you study a foreign language, and learn to speak it fluently...
130|It is just a means to communicate with those of another country.
130|It's not necessarily an effort to assimilate into the other culture.
130|It's the same thing.
130|She was created in the likeness of humans not to be a human being, nor to become a person.
130|It was to be together with humans.
130|Not to be, not to become.
130|But to be together.
130|To Create An Amicable Relation With Someone In Another Culture, You Must Understand That Foreign Culture And Look Into It—
130|When In Rome, Do As The Romans Do
130|In the first place, you know master...
130|Why do aberrations in legends, or in other words so-called metamorphic monsters,
130|always take the shape of humans or animals?
130|Basically, they're unreal existences, yet they base their shape on things that really exist.
130|You've never really thought about it?
130|I Had Never Thought About It.
130|That Is Well, If I Can Say So, Perhaps The Limitations Of Human Imagination—
130|Humans Can Only Speak About Reality Using Words They Know—
130|In the end...
130|Abberations exist thanks to people... They exist because humans exist.
130|This doesn't mean that aberrations are dependent on humans though.
130|It just means that if there's nobody to observe, nobody's being observed.
130|Even I, who was dubbed a legendary vampire,
130|would not be a vampire without that legend. The same as any other aberration.
130|If you can't speak of the aberration,
130|it isn't an aberration.
130|A ghost story must be a story of the supernatural.
130|Well, This Is More That Unpleasant Guy In a Hawaiin Shirt's Values
130|and Way of Thinking
130|—
130|l
130|When you dig down, an aberration is just an attachment.
130|Attachment. Emotions.
130|Can that perhaps be a feeling similar to sympathizing with a doll?
130|For tsukumo-gami, and what people consider "what-a-waste ghosts,"
130|one could say they're all created like this.
130|The way of thinking that gods can reside in all things...
130|The belief that there is a myriad of gods... I hear that's something unique to Japan.
130|However, it doesn't matter if it's living or not...
130|sympathy for things other than humans exists all over the world.
130|That is why ghost stories are told all over the world.
130|They are told,
130|by humans. I can be convinced of that.
130|No, it's a story I have no choice but to be convinced of.
130|After the numerous aberrations, as someone who has told stories of aberrations...
130|About the vampire.
130|About the cat.
130|About the crab.
130|About the snail.
130|About the monkey.
130|About the snake.
130|About the bee.
130|About the phoenix.
130|As the one who told these stories, I have no choice but to be convinced.
130|And now, I am once again trying to tell a story, one of a doll.
130|But I feel like I've talked too much.
130|Urban legends.
130|Street gossip.
130|Secondhand information.
130|When they're spoken too much, they lose their meaning.
130|The hair-raising and awe-inspiring feelings both disappear.
130|Thinking back to the "darkness" that started on the first day of the second term...
130|Or Sengoku Nadeko's incident with the snake god around the New Year...
130|I wonder how much longer things will go like this. I'm kinda fed up with it.
130|To The Apparitions Which I Meet One After Another
130|Feeling That Trickery Is Starting To No Longer Work
130|I Also Feel Despair From It—
130|But that feeling is a luxury.
130|To think that it will continue forever is a luxury.
130|This world doesn't work like that. I should have known that.
130|No, thinking of "what if" is no use this late.
130|Every story is marked with "The End" at some point.
130|What Is This? The Rowdy Days Seem To Continue For Just A Bit Longer?
130|The Repetition Of Such Words
130|Will Someday Reach Its Limit.
130|The story of the doll that I'm going to tell is the story where I came to understand that.
130|The story with the message that I understood, whether I liked it or not.
130|That is why this is the beginning of the end.
130|This story is about how a human named Araragi Koyomi...
130|about how myself, Araragi Koyomi...
130|will end and begin. That is this story.
130|doki doki no yuuyami ni
130|Under the breathtaking twilight
130|kira kira na hoshi ga chirari
130|The sparkling stars flutter
130|sore de ii no kamo
130|That might be enough
130|kitto riyuu ga atte
130|But I am sure there is a reason

130|The sparkling stars flutter
130|Nii-chan! Damn you, it's morning!
130|You can't keep sleeping!
130|Today, I suddenly wanted to think about having or not having an alarm clock.
130|Bluntly, the words "alarm clock" and the existence of such a thing are not things I like.
130|Reference
130|Omitted
130|That this hatred may be linked to alarm clocks...
130|Omitted
130|Alarm clock... Alarm clock...
130|Arm clock al...
130|Omitted
130|To the phrase that states "You awaken someone's eyes," I feel crazy anger, and because of that...
130|So, we who are woken up would like to say this to the alarm clock.
130|Not with hatred, but with thanks.
130|Thank you, and good night.
130|Don't sleep!
130|Just because you don't want to wake up, you're gonna use that big excuse, Nii-chan?
130|In the first place, we're not alarms but your little sisters. We're alarm sisters.
130|Interesting. I'd like them to make figures out of you or something.
130|All right, I'm awake. My consciousness is fully aware.
130|February 13th, huh?
130|It's the day before Valentine's Day.
130|Hey, little sisters, are you ready to give me some chocolate?
130|Wow!
130|You know, Nii-chan, this isn't the time for you to be worried about Valentine's Day.
130|Not the time, nor the hour.
130|Come on, there's only a month left until you take those college entrance exams.
130|Get it?
130|If you don't get it, you understand that you're better off dead, right? I'll kill you!
130|Even if you say that, I don't remember being told that, and I have no clue why I'd be killed off.
130|Geez. Geez, I say.
130|This is why you're a piece of trash, Nii-chan.
130|Now, wake up and go study already. Cram yourself into that corner.
130|This may be the time for a last spurt, but I don't think this is the time for me to cram myself...
130|And you, if you let your guard down, you won't be able to go up a grade either.
130|It's not the time for you to worry just about me.
130|Fine, I'll tickle you.
130|Take that, take that.
130|That won't work! I've trained well, so the soles of my feet are pretty thick!
130|Got it, I'll lick it then.
130|Take that, take that.
130|I Will Especially Keep It A Secret
130|Whether I Actually Licked Or Karen Pulled Her Foot
130|Back Before I Licked To Preserve The Privacy Of Us Siblings.
130|I Will Especially Keep It A Secret
130|Whether I Actually Licked Or Karen Pulled Her Foot
130|Back Before I Licked To Preserve The Privacy Of Us Siblings.
130|SECRET
130|Looks like you're fine now.
130|Then I'm gonna go running for a bit.
130|I'm gonna go a run-ning.
130|So have the bath ready for me.
130|A bath so hot I'll get burned. If you'd like, how about coming to run with me for a while, Nii-chan?
130|There's no way I'd be able to keep up with the pace you set.
130|You always go running at the pace of a 100-meter dash.
130|And you run like, a full marathon. Like 42.195 kilometers!
130|Go run with Kanbaru or something!
130|See ya! Daddy-O-Nii-chan!
130|Now...
130|I guess I'll go get that bath ready for Karen's sake.
130|For Karen's sake, I can take the effort this early in the morning
130|to spare some time and whip up this old body to prepare her bath.
130|You're so condescending, Onii-chan.
130|You're forcing entire layers of condescendence.
130|She trains her body hard like a samurai sword.
130|But this sharp mind wonders, why doesn't she join an athletic club or something?
130|Karen-chan can't join any athletic clubs.
130|It's a rule of her school of karate. All students are forbidden from joining any clubs.
130|'Cause they're the type about execution. 'Cause they're totally the type about execution.
130|'Cause they're the type. 'Cause.
130|I don't really get it but...
130|Tsukihi, don't you think it's a waste to see Karen's talent buried away?
130|Meow?
130|Though she doesn't come close to me, she's a human that's really overflowing with talent.
130|Like, don't you want to see her in the spotlight or something?
130|Not just tied down to the school, or the Fire Sisters.
130|That's right, we can have her aim to be an Olympic ath- Ouch!
130|What was that about?!
130|Eh? You were being irritating, Onii-chan...
130|Anyone that tries to sever the bonds of the Fire Sisters can't be forgiven. Not even you, Onii-chan.
130|Eh? You were thinking about disbanding though.
130|You said you'd invite me to the disbanding party filled with junior high girls.
130|It pisses me off when someone else says it.
130|Well...
130|Even without having someone like you say it, Onii-chan,
130|it's true that Karen-chan will retire from the Fire Sisters someday for sure.
130|I'm sure lots of things will happen once she's in high school.
130|I think all sorts of things will dazzle her.
130|The environment will change too.
130|But even then, I don't think Karen-chan will quit going to that dojo.
130|Karen-chan is fascinated with her master right now.
130|Well, I don't know how my college entrance exam will go.
130|I don't know which way it will roll.
130|But, no matter which way it goes, in due time,
130|my environment will change more than Karen's for sure.
130|Before that, for Karen and Tsukihi...
130|My heart as the big brother tells me I need to instill some logic into them.
130|Surprisingly enough, a thought like that isn't missing from my brain.
130|Right. It's high time that the Fire Sisters wake up.
130|And me too.
130|I'll make it really hot, just how she likes it.
130|I want to take a bath now, too.
130|Onii-chan!
130|You're the west! No wait, you're the worst!
130|West!
130|The Worst
130|West!
130|You said you were drawing a bath just for Karen, but you were planning on bathing first!
130|You're the worst!
130|The worst!
130|Look at you though...
130|Looking at the way you're dressed, I can't help but think you were about to do the same thing...
130|In any case, get out of my way Onii-chan.
130|I'm going to bathe in that bath.
130|If you get in my way, Onii-chan, even you will regret it.
130|Little sister...
130|If you insist on bathing right now, you'll need to bea- Ah!
130|That was dangerous!
130|What the hell are you doing?!
130|You just said, "Defeat your big brother."
130|If you want to pass here...
130|Okay, got it. Onii-chan, let's take this path.
130|This path?
130|This path to the bathroom to bathe together.
130|Why...
130|「
130|」
130|Hey You, Are You All Talk?
130|I Guess You're All Bark And No Bite.
130|You Didn't Have The Guts To
130|Take A Bath With Me In Reality,
130|Did You, You Chicken Girl!
130|It Is Not A Bath As Spacious As The Anime Version,
130|Or Rather It Is An Average Sized Bath For An Average Family,
130|Onii-chan...
130|What is it, little sister?
130|Please say something. It's more awkward than I thought it would be.
130|Oh... If it's awkward just leave, Tsukihi.
130|You really do act like the good girl, don't you.
130|If you were going to back off, you shouldn't have suggested it in the first place.
130|I can say that to you too, Onii-chan. This is the definition of "reaping what you sow."
130|I'm just saying, I feel awkward looking at this body of yours, Onii-chan.
130|I feel nothing from bathing with you. Nothing at all.
130|Or, could it be Onii-chan, that your hot spring's steam is rising from your naked sister's body?
130|This is the bathroom, so do you want to leave?
130|You gonna say that twice? You really going to say that twice?
130|You're the one that's charmed by my body.
130|Really, you want to touch these abs, don't you?
130|I don't want to do that at all.
130|I don't want to touch that eight-pack at all.
130|You're counting. Don't count my abs. You're looking!
130|You're totally looking at your little sister's boobs too.
130|Not possible.
130|It's not like this is the first time I've seen them.
130|Isn't that strange?! For a big brother to have seen his little sister's boobs.
130|I know all of it, you know! I know everything about those lumps of meat you have on your chest!
130|Don't call them lumps of meat! Don't make a young girl's boobs sound like something you can barbecue!
130|Onii-chan, anyway...
130|Let's take turns washing our hair.
130|We both have way too much hair,
130|so it's inefficient to wash our hair side by side like this. It's not economical.
130|I don't think the economy has anything to do with washing your hair, but...
130|Sometimes She Says Things That Are Just Right.
130|Tsukihi, what are we going to do if we can't sit side by side though?
130|Taking turns... Just what kind of a position will we need to take?
130|In other words, we do this!
130|I'm going to wash your hair like this, Onii-chan!
130|This "W-" Was Short For "What?" To Use As An Expression Of Surprise,
130|But At The Same Time It Was Short For "Wow, I See" As Well. W-
130|Okay, I'll stand it up.
130|Amazing! You're Astro Onii-chan! You're Super Onii-chan now!
130|Don't make it sound like I'm a Super Saiyan.
130|I'll rinse it off now.
130|Squeak, squeak, squeak.
130|I'll go on and wash your body like this.
130|Onii-chan, Onii-chan!
130|What? You sound like you just came up with something.
130|I just thought of a one-liner. A really funny one.
130|What's with the way you brought it up though? I don't feel good about this...
130|Come on, come on, look over here, over here.
130|What is it?
130|The title: Metropolitan Ordinance.
130|Scary!
130|What are you doing?!
130|And what are you doing?!
130|Posing like this and raising my arms up together,
130|and then saying "Sky Tree!" might have been better huh?
130|But In That Case, It Might Be Better
130|For Karen To Do So—
130|Come on, I'll wash your body now, so you can look away.
130|Hmm... Tsukihi...
130|I don't know if you're wishing for something, but why don't you at least cut your bangs?
130|You know, if I don't cut my hair well,
130|my bangs go "prickle, prickle" in my eyes and it hurts.
130|No matter how much loving care I give to my hair, it hurts if it gets in my eyes.
130|I see.
130|Speaking of bangs...
130|Nadeko-chan was released from the hospital.
130|I see... I'm glad.
130|Huh? Your reaction wasn't how I imagined it.
130|I expected you to literally dance in joy.
130|I see.
130|All I could say was "I see." I didn't have the right to say anything else.
130|But I'm glad she was released from the hospital.
130|Though, I can never show my face to Sengoku again.
130|But I can still say I'm glad.
130|Somehow, I can think like that.
130|Onii-chan...
130|What?
130|Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!
130|My (ouch) head (ouch)...
130|Are you trying to (ouch) use your hands (ouch) as a vise?! (ouch, ouch)
130|Oh, sorry, sorry. I put too much strength in them.
130|You know Onii-chan, though I think you probably don't want me to say this to you...
130|It's because you probably don't want me to say it that I'll say it.
130|You're putting a lot of weight on your shoulders, you know? Too much.
130|The thing with Nadeko-chan couldn't be helped, but you can't carry it on your shoulders!
130|She Says Such Obvious Things,
130|But Especially Tsukihi, About Sengoku,
130|About How She Was Missing For The Past Few Months
130|Is Not Something She Knows The Minute Details Of.
130|Go visit her sometime, okay?
130|Nadeko-chan has to rest at home for a while,
130|and it'll be impossible for you to visit once you're busy with your college entrance exam.
130|Now that Nadeko Sengoku has descended from the mountain and her "disappearance" has been solved—
130|Well of course, that's a good thing. A wonderful thing.
130|However, that good, wonderful thing has once again created...
130|an extremely unstable area in this town. Or so I've been told.
130|And without solving that issue, or at least doing something about it if it can't be solved,
130|trouble will keep on coming to this town.
130|I have to say, I feel regret at the thought of leaving this place, even if you leave my sisters out of the equation.
130|Even if everything doesn't turn out fine, I need to make sure there's a good balance.
130|Balance, huh?
130|That wasn't my role at first.
130|It's not your role at all.
130|You carry too much weight on your shoulders, Onii-chan.
130|It's not like you can solve anything and everything, Onii-chan.
130|You can toss stuff aside, leave stuff alone, and know your place in the world.
130|You can live within your means and leave some stuff for others. I don't think that's that bad, you know?
130|About Nadeko-chan...
130|About Karen-chan...
130|And about me.
130|You worry about us way too much.
130|Actually Onii-chan, how's your studying for the college entrance exam really going?
130|You think you can get ahead with one more month?
130|Somehow... I'll figure something out.
130|So That's What I Had To Answer.
130|Even If It Wasn't, I Had To Answer That Way.
130|Such A Sad Self-Hypnosis.
130|That's why I'm saying it's time for you to cram instead of carrying these things on your shoulders, Onii-chan.
130|This is good advice, Onii-chan.
130|Is this really the time for you to be washing your little sister's body?
130|Well, it's not like I felt responsible
130|and assigned myself a particular role of washing you while you took your bath.
130|It's not that I'm lathering you up or fondling you.
130|In the first place, this hasn't solved the fundamental problem at all.
130|By going in order when washing ourselves, we solved the problem of how cramped the washing space was.
130|But, the first objective, about how narrow the tub is...
130|Yeah, that's right...
130|For the idea of bathing together, bathing with a young girl would have been better,
130|but the size of this tub makes it hard to do it with someone in junior high.
130|A young girl?
130|Nothing. Forget!
130|Do it again!
130|Do it again! Do it again!
130|Hey, do it again! Again, again!
130|The mirror was showing Tsukihi's naked body...
130|That was a natural phenomenon, and therefore something very natural.
130|However, there was something unnatural as well.
130|No. There was something supernatural.
130|Araragi Koyomi, or me, was not present in the mirror's image.
130|The mirror wasn't showing me.
130|As if I were an immortal aberration... A vampire.
130|itsumo doori no atarimae no hibi wo
130|These normal, ordinary days...
130|itsumade konna fuu ni sugoserundarou
130|I wonder how long we can continue passing our time like this
130|sonna koto kangaeta shunkan kara
130|From the moment I thought about that
130|owari ha hajimarikakechatteru no kana
130|I wondered if the end had already begun
130|yoku ataru uranai toka
130|Let’s blame it on my spot-on fortunes
130|haneta kami no sei ni shite
130|Or on my curled up hair

130|But I’m frozen in place again today, unable to change

130|This is starting to become a world where you don't exist
130|kyou to iu hi wo koukai suru nante iya da
130|I don’t want to grow to regret the day called “today”
130|ima shika nai itsudatte
130|There’s nothing but right now, and even though
130|shitteta noni kyou mo ienakute
130|I’ve always known that, I wasn’t able to say anything today
130|anna hibi ni mou nido to modorenai toshitemo
130|Even if we can never go back to those days
130|nee nando demo atarashiku hajimetai

130|ima shika nai itsudatte
130|There’s nothing but right now
130|shitteru kara kyou ha iitakute
130|Even though I’ve always known that, I want to tell you today
131|Is something wrong, Brother?
131|What is it, Brother?!
131|Got it.
131|Go ahead, Brother.
131|What a great run!
131|Thanks for turning the water on, Brother!
131|I'll make sure to thank you la—
131|What the hell are you doing?!
131|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
131|as the stars twinkle above
131|Yotsugi Doll
131|I guess this is enough for me
131|I'm sure there's a reason
131|There's more to this world
131|than the things I can see
131|The reason you laugh
131|is my reason to cry
131|Getting logical and serious about this won't let us take another step
131|I'll make a wish upon that shooting star
131|Too bad I'm not sure anymore
131|what I want for the future
131|That's how we pass our days
131|Let's go to bed and to hell with making sense
131|My heart pounds
131|when I eat this sparkling orange mint
131|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
131|as the stars twinkle above
131|Hey, Shinobu! Shinobu!
131|You awake, Shinobu?
131|Wake up!
131|Please, Shinobu!
131|Shinobu!
131|It's morning!
131|You gotta wake up!
131|Shinobu! We bought some donuts!
131|From Mister Donut!
131|We got you a Golden Chocolate!
131|Wonderful!
131|That's the long and short of it.
131|I see, I see.
131|So you started turning into a vampire, even though I haven't sucked your blood.
131|I assume that's where you're going with this?
131|Yes. Precisely.
131|Well, not entirely.
131|Look at the nail on my pinky toe.
131|It's broken, right?
131|Yes. Something your sister did.
131|I don't think I've started turning into a vampire since it's not quite healed yet.
131|Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
131|Don't struggle. It's distracting.
131|Hmm, I see.
131|You see what?
131|A few things, but not everything.
131|I think for now,
131|you should just get dressed.
131|I'll be brief: It's just as you thought.
131|You've completely turned into a vampire.
131|For example, there's no other supernatural phenomenon that would cause your reflection to not appear in a mirror.
131|So it's due to being a vampire?
131|But look at my toe, Shinobu. It isn't he—
131|Look at it yourself, then.
131|It's perfectly healed.
131|It doesn't really look like it...
131|That's just what it looks like.
131|Inside, it's healed fully.
131|Inside?
131|It's actually my assumption that your sister fractured it.
131|Fractured?
131|The fracture has healed.
131|Incompletely, perhaps.
131|Well, that isn't really what I picture when I think of a vampire's regenerative ability.
131|I know this might not be the best explanation for you.
131|Either way, I recommend that you close the blinds.
131|With that level of regeneration,
131|a vampire would turn into ash so fast that you wouldn't even have time to burst into flames.
131|I know!
131|Why don't we ask her?
131|Her?
131|It seems clear to me that some kind of change is happening within you.
131|If that change is related to vampirism as I suspect,
131|then we should consult a specialist.
131|A specialist...
131|You mean?
131|Oshino
131|Who's that?
131|Who should we ask?
131|Ononoki Yotsugi.
131|Ononoki, huh?
131|But strictly speaking, Ononoki isn't the specialist, she's just the familiar of one... Kagenui Yozuru.
131|Kagenui...
131|Yeah... I guess so...
131|She's probably the toughest person I know.
131|And to be optimistic here, she's very reliable when she's on your side.
131|Actually, hold on.
131|What is it?
131|I don't have their numbers!
131|What?
131|Well, that's annoying.
131|Even if you can't call them, maybe you can contact them some other way?
131|Hmm...
131|Why don't you ask Kaiki?
131|You can get in touch with Kaiki, right?
131|Ask him to help you find her.
131|Are you serious?
131|That's basically out of the question, even as a last resort.
131|My sweet Shinobu!
131|Don't call me that.
131|Don't look so desperate.
131|I was kidding.
131|Either way, there's only one candidate left now.
131|Candidate? There are still candidates?
131|Oh, you mean Hanekawa?
131|She's a smart girl, but hardly a specialist.
131|I'm talking about Gaen.
131|Gaen?
131|I
131|KN O W
131|EV ER YT HI NG
131|Gaen Izuko.
131|Isn't she the head specialist?
131|Gaen Izuko...
131|I don't know.
131|I feel increasingly reluctant to seek help from her the more I think about it.
131|Aye.
131|I wouldn't exactly recommend relying on her, myself.
131|It wasn't a joke either.
131|I merely wanted you to know the options.
131|At this point, the best choice is contacting Gaen and asking her to let us talk to Kagenui and Ononoki.
131|Okay.
131|I have no counterargument.
131|Thank you, Shinobu.
131|I deserve no gratitude.
131|I deserve donuts.
131|I've made sure that, if you visit the arcade
131|I've made sure that, if you visit the arcade on the fourth floor of the department store
131|if you visit the arcade on the fourth floor of the department store downtown at 7:00 PM, you'll meet Yotsugi. Perhaps someday you
131|you'll meet Yotsugi. Perhaps someday you could repay this favor with a little kindness? Your friend Gaen Izuko
131|could repay this favor with a little kindness? Your friend
131|Gaen Izuko
131|Brother!
131|How dare you run away and abandon me like that?!
131|Do you have any idea how hard Karen punches?!
131|Huh?
131|Why did you close the blinds?
131|Abandoning society now? Trying to sneak a nap in?
131|Not on my watch.
131|No, the light was too bright.
131|Oh?
131|Anyway! Brother, apologize to me.
131|Apologize! Apologize!
131|I want your words!
131|Apologize!
131|Admit your errors!
131|You have a wonderful personality.
131|All right. Come here.
131|You'll apologize, right?
131|Very well.
131|Allow me a request.
131|What? You won't apologize but make a request instead?
131|Consider it my courtesy that it isn't an order.
131|Your courtesy isn't in order?
131|Tsukihi, you and Karen will sleep at Kanbaru's place tonight.
131|Why?
131|Don't ask, please.
131|I will talk to Karen and Kanbaru myself.
131|Just do it.
131|Please.
131|Ononoki was less of a problem than Kagenui.
131|If I were to make contact with them, Tsukihi had to be taken to safety first.
131|At the very least, she couldn't stay at home.
131|Otherwise.
131|It'll be like summer vacation all over again.
131|Fine. If it makes you happy.
131|Yes.
131|I don't mind apologizing if you do that.
131|I'm sorry.

131|Possesstory Appearance Episode Yotsugi Doll Part 2
131|Black
131|Ononoki?
131|Yotsugi?
131|Yotsugi!
131|Yotsu!
131|Let's try to get her out.
131|That wasn't even close.
131|Oh, you woke up, Shinobu.
131|You shouldn't get too close to the glass.
131|It reflects.
131|So, why do you appear in it?
131|Is it because you lost your powers as a vampire?
131|Right now, yes.
131|But in my particular case, I was able to appear in mirrors at will if I wanted during my heyday.
131|Weaknesses were not true weaknesses.
131|This is the spot!
131|This arm is too weak!
131|No, my master.
131|Obviously, it had enough power in it to move her that much when you struck her in the head with it.
131|And?
131|So stop trying to pick her up with it.
131|Just move her towards the hole.
131|Jackpot, Shinobu! And then they lived happily ever after!
131|I feel like you've lost sight of the goal here.
131|The goal?
131|Wasn't the goal to score an Ononoki?
131|No.
131|Don't be ridiculous.
131|How could there be something greater than scoring a maiden?
131|If you think so.
131|Collect her and let's go home, then.
131|Yotsugi!
131|No reply.
131|It's just a corpse.
131|That took way too long.
131|Chop!
131|Yay—
131|Anyway. Long time no see, Devil Brother.
131|Devil
131|Brother
131|Don't call me a devil.
131|Long time no see, Sister Shinobu.
131|I'm not your sister.
131|What are you getting at?
131|By the way, Ononoki.
131|What is it? Yay—
131|Kagenui... She's not around here, is she?
131|Are you alone, Ononoki?
131|I'm not.
131|Greetings.
131|Wait, you're the one who just showed up.
131|I see.
131|Yer nail.
131|What?
131|Gee's a swatch a yer nail.
131|An odd pose.
131|Have a swatch.
131|What?
131|It's right back tae normal.
131|This is strange.
131|It's strange, Kagenui.
131|When I put on socks just before I left, it hadn't healed to this degree.
131|There is an obvious explanation.
131|A noxious plantation, Brother Demon.
131|Oh, right.
131|A vampire's power grows stronger at night.
131|And the moon shone on you for a while.
131|The moonlight, not the sunlight, heals a vampire's wounds.
131|Yay—
131|So Shinobu's diagnosis was correct after all.
131|Shinobu hypothesized that I had turned into a vampire.
131|Cannae say for sure just yet, I'm afraid.
131|Here, Yotsugi.
131|Yes, Sister?
131|Do yer thing.
131|Okay.
131|Don't bite me!
131|Don't chew!
131|Don't sweat one toe.
131|I want my toe!
131|The result, Yotsugi?
131|Analysis ongoing.
131|Okay.
131|Right Araragi, let's progress tae the next stage while Yotsugi's analyzing the taste of yer foot.
131|Gee's yer hand.
131|My hand?
131|Aye. I wish tae read yer palm.
131|All right.
131|All right
131|Och wheesht.
131|Oh well, I put up a shielding spell, so ye can run around and scream all ye like.
131|Why would you do this, Kagenui?!
131|It hurts! Ouch!
131|Well, that's no good.
131|Ye cannae just writhe in agony.
131|Focus on regeneration.
131|Think about healin'.
131|We're testing yer regeneration.
131|Testing?
131|Try tae aid yer regeneration ideologically, conceptually.
131|Ye need yer right hand for writing.
131|That fracture'll take one or two months tae heal.
131|These fingers must heal.
131|Or else I can't grope Hanekawa's breasts!
131|The power of puberty, eh?
131|That's exactly what I wanted tae see, though.
131|Yotsugi.
131|What of yer analysis?
131|I'm more or less done.
131|I believe Shinobu is mostly correct.
131|However...
131|However?
131|Yes, however...
131|No, I have no authority to say this.
131|Saying that makes it even more intriguing.
131|I think you should call out Shinobu.
131|Out from your shadow.
131|I would like her opinion.
131|Aye.
131|I'll even apologize for havin' stood on her heed earlier.
131|Call out the former Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.
131|If ye take yer time,
131|I might just have tae jam my hand in yer shadow and yank her out like yer guts.
131|If ye take yer time,
131|It'd be a good, strong pull, hard enough that I'd likely just end up wae a fistful of blonde hair.
131|Former Heart-Under-Blade.
131|Sorry for steppin' on yer heed as best I could.
131|Haha.
131|I believe you've concluded your investigation of my master.
131|Good work in my stead.
131|That even ones such as yourselves could aid my master is testament to you being in the right place at the right time.
131|I should apologize for forcin' ye tae put up such a ludicrous charade.
131|Yer heed shared an uncanny resemblance tae a landing strip, ye see. I just couldnae resist.
131|Please stop.
131|Haha.
131|Mind your words, human.
131|Do not forget that the sole reason I have not slain you is my expectation that you will resolve my master's carnal straits.
131|I apologize, I apologize...
131|for havin' stepped on yer proud heed
131|which was so very low in the air.
131|Don't hold it against me.
131|Creatures of the night are always so gloomy.
131|Sorry, sorry. I'll make sure it doesnae happen again.
131|Please stop, Kagenui.
131|And you too, Shinobu.
131|It's not worth holding a grudge.
131|But she—
131|You bravely volunteered your own body to protect me from Kagenui's soles.
131|It was the noblest altruism and self-sacrifice.
131|Thinking of it like that will save your pride.
131|Yes, you're right.
131|Yes, yes, absolutely! I protected you!
131|I'm so cool!
131|Did I really lose to this person?
131|Very well.
131|We have the actors, we have the script. I suppose it's time for the performance.
131|Let us proceed tae the solution without quizzing the audience.
131|The answer tae the riddle.
131|The answer to the riddle?
131|Very well. Proceed.
131|Araragi Koyomi.
131|Your body is at present—in the present progressive— very slowly turning into a vampire.
131|That is the current situation.
131|Turning into a vampire, huh?
131|I'm surprised. Yer takin' this rather well.
131|Well, I've turned into a vampire plenty of times before.
131|And experience is the teacher of fools, as they say.
131|Then experience made you no less of a fool.
131|Shinobu, I want to make sure:
131|You really don't know yourself, right?
131|You don't know what befalls your master?
131|If I did, we wouldn't have to rely on you two.
131|Oshino said nothin' about this, did he?
131|Of course not.
131|I suppose he wouldnae.
131|What Oshino didnae foresee, in this case, is yer own actions, Araragi.
131|Ye see, Araragi.
131|Ye've become a vampire too much.
131|Experience is the teacher of fools, and some fools gather too much experience.
131|Because you relied on the power of a vampire so often during your attempts to help others,
131|your soul has very fundamentally become vampiric without any connection to the former Heart-Under-Blade.
131|Become vampiric?
131|In the literal sense; you are a vampire.
131|An easy-to-understand and direct way would be to say
131|not that you have become a vampire too much but that you have become used to the idea of being it.
131|It no longer scares you.
131|Wait...
131|Some in my trade've also become oddities in the same manner.
131|It's for this reason that I have a representative.
131|This is what Oshino failed tae predict.
131|Perhaps he never attempted tae dae so.
131|If ye have no expectations, ye'll never be surprised.
131|Unusual it is, then.
131|The worst episode was likely with the Snake God.
131|During those days, being a vampire was like eating, drinking, or breathing to you.
131|Well...
131|It was my fault Sengoku became what she did.
131|At the very least, I felt like it was.
131|Therefore—
131|All right, I understand the gist of it.
131|I can't say I get it all, though.
131|So, what should I do, Ononoki?
131|What do you mean?
131|What should I do to return to being human?
131|Devil Brother...
131|Yotsugi spoke.
131|Without hesitation, without concern.
131|With the eyes,
131|and the voice, of a doll.
131|You can't.
131|There is no way to return.
131|How much longer, do you think,
131|can we live our ordinary lives like this?
131|Perhaps that thought alone
131|invites the end of it
131|I blame my misfortune on little things in life
131|instead of taking a step forward
131|You had to be gone from my life
131|before I started treasuring my days
131|I always tell myself that my time is limited,
131|but could never confess my love
131|Even if our days together are over,
131|I will find happiness again
131|Now I know that my time is limited,
131|and so I want to confess my love
132|Onii-chan, is something wrong?
132|Wh-What is it, Onii-chan?
132|I get it. It's fine, Onii-chan.
132|Whew! I worked up a good sweat!
132|Nii-chan, thanks for getting that bath ready for me!
132|I have to go say thanks properly later!
132|Wait, what are you doing, you fool!

132|Hey, Shinobu. Shinobu. Shinobu, are you awake?
132|No, please wake up. I'm begging you, Shinobu.
132|Shinobu! Shinobu!
132|Shinobu! Damn you, it's morning!
132|You really need to get up already!
132|Shinobu! I have donuts, Shinobu! It's Mister Donut, your favorite!
132|I have Golden Chocolate!
132|Impressive!
132|...and that's how it went.
132|Hmph, I see.
132|In other words, I haven't sucked your blood, but you've turned into a vampire, master.
132|That's it, right?
132|Yeah, that's right. That's it.
132|Well, no, it's a bit different actually.
132|Look at this foot over here. At my small toe's toenail. It's split open, right?
132|Yeah. You said your little sister crushed it.
132|Since this hasn't healed, I don't think I've turned into a vampire.
132|I see.
132|Ouch, ouch, ouch!
132|Don't be so noisy, you're breaking my concentration.
132|Hmph. I see.
132|Y-You figured something out?
132|Well, I kinda understand and kinda don't...
132|But for now, you should put some clothes on, master.
132|My conclusion is, you're definitely a vampire now, master.
132|It fits with what you presumed, master.
132|The fact that you don't show up in the mirror is not a phenomenon caused by some other aberration,
132|but is because you are a vampire.
132|A vampire? But look Shinobu, I'm telling you, my small toe...
132|"Look closely" is my line. That toe has been healing.
132|Eh?
132|Well, it doesn't look like it has healed much...
132|That's just on the surface... Deep inside, it's a different story.
132|Deep inside?
132|Most likely, when your little sister stomped on top of it, that small toe broke.
132|It broke?!
132|In other words, you are healing, even if it's not perfectly healed yet.
132|But, the way this is healing is different from how I imagined a vampire would heal...
132|I know you're unsatisfied with my conclusion. But you know, I recommend closing those curtains over there, master.
132|If a vampire with only that level of self-healing basked in sunlight, they wouldn't even burst into flames.
132|They'd just turn to ash and that would be the end of it.
132|That's right. How about you ask that person?
132|Hmm? Person?
132|Well, your physical body's undergoing some change now for sure, master.
132|And if it is just like I presume and it's a changed related to vampirism,
132|you should consult a specialist about it.
132|A Specialist.....
132|Does She Mean
132|Oshino?
132|Who's this "person" you're telling me to ask?
132|Ononoki Yotsugi.
132|Ononoki-chan, huh...
132|Oh, but to be precise, Ononoki-chan isn't the specialist,
132|but the one who uses her as a shikigami, Kagenui Yozuru-san, right?
132|Kagenui-san...
132|Right. You're right.
132|Of all the people I know, she's the definitely the strongest one.
132|And if I look at it from the perspective that she's on my side, I'm sure that she would be reliable.
132|No... Wait, hold on, Shinobu.
132|What is it?
132|I don't know how to get in contact with those two at all!
132|What?
132|Well, that puts us in a bind.
132|Even if we can't call them, don't you have some way of getting in touch with them?
132|Let's see...
132|What about Kaiki? Can't you at least get in touch with Kaiki?
132|You could contact Kaiki, and have him put you through to Kagenui? How's that?
132|You're really going to say that?
132|That's a last resort, or rather, something I can't even use as my last resort, Shinobu-chan.
132|Don't you use that "-chan" honorific on me.
132|Don't look so pathetic. Of course it was just a joke.
132|But, if that's the case, there is only one candidate left.
132|Candidate? There was someone else?
132|Oh I see, it's Hanekawa, isn't it?
132|That girl has sharp wits, but she isn't a specialist.
132|I didn't mean her. I meant Gaen.
132|Gaen...
132|I Know Everything—
132|Gaen Izuko. She's the leader of the specialists, right?
132|Gaen Izuko...
132|What is this? The feeling of not wanting to look for help is growing more and more...
132|Right. I can't recommend that you rely directly on her.
132|I didn't mean it as a joke, but it's an option.
132|So perhaps contacting Gaen,
132|and getting in touch with Kagenui through her is really the best chance you have.
132|Okay, I have no objection to that. Thank you, Shinobu.
132|You don't have to thank me.
132|Though, you do have to get me some donuts.

132|Onii-chan!
132|What were you trying to do by abandoning me and running off like that!
132|Just how hard do you think that Karen beat me up afterwords?!
132|Meow?
132|Why do you have the curtains shut? Are you becoming a shut-in?
132|Or are you going back to sleep? You know I won't let you right?
132|No, no, the sunlight was a bit too bright.
132|Meow...
132|In any case, Onii-chan, apologize to me.
132|Apologize! Apologize!
132|Shoot me with your words!
132|Say it, shoot me, apologize! Admit your faults and apologize!
132|You have some personality you know... All right, come over here for a bit.
132|Oh? You're going to apologize?
132|No objections here!
132|Meow?
132|Your Onii-chan has a favor to ask.
132|What? You're not going to apologize but instead demand?
132|Find it a blessing that I'm not calling this a command.
132|A blessing story?
132|Tsukihi, listen up.
132|Tonight, you and Karen are going to go and spend the night at Kanbaru's.
132|Eh? What do you mean?
132|Don't ask me for the reason. Please don't ask me.
132|I'll talk it out with Kanbaru and Karen. But I want you to do it. Please.
132|Ononoki-chan aside, since I'm trying to contact Kagenui-san right now, I have to hide Tsukihi.
132|At the very least, she has to be away from this house.
132|Or Else.
132|It Will Be A Second Coming Of Summer Break.
132|Hmm... Fine. That's what you want me to do, right?
132|Yeah. If you do that, I don't mind apologizing.
132|Sorry.

132|Black Scene
132|Ononoki-chan?
132|Yotsugi-chan?
132|Yo-tsu-gi!
132|Yo-chan!
132|I guess I'll give it a shot for now.
132|You suck really bad at this, master.
132|You woke up, Shinobu?
132|Or rather, master, you shouldn't get so close to the glass.
132|It'll act like a mirror.
132|Hmm? Actually, Shinobu, you're showing up perfectly fine...
132|Is this because your vampire powers are gone?
132|For now, that's true.
132|When I was at full power I could show myself in a mirror if I wanted to though.
132|For me, a weakness isn't a weakness.
132|All right! Here!
132|This arm's power is so weak!
132|No, you actually got a direct hit on that girl's head.
132|At the very least, that had enough power to change Ononoki's position.
132|Hmm. In other words?
132|Don't try to pick Ononoki up with that arm,
132|but hit her with it and roll her over into that hole.
132|I did it, Shinobu! It's a happy ending!
132|I feel like we've forgotten why we came here in the first place...
132|Why we came? We came to get Ononoki-chan in the first place, didn't we?
132|No.
132|Impossible. Is there anything more important than getting a little girl?
132|If you're fine with that, master, hurry up and grab it and let's go home already.
132|Yotsugi-chan!
132|......There Is No Answer.
132|It Looks Like Just A Corpse
132|You took way too long.
132|Chop.
132|Yay!
132|In any case, it's been a while, Devil-chan.
132|Devil
132|-
132|chan
132|Don't call me Devil-chan.
132|Shinobu-neesan, it's been a while too.
132|Don't call me Shinobu-neesan. What's up with that? How are we related?
132|Anyway, Ononoki-chan...
132|What, what? Yay!
132|Kagenui-san, well, isn't around here, right? So, are you here by yourself, Ononoki-chan?
132|No, no.
132|Welcome.
132|You're The Guest That Dropped By.
132|I see...
132|Hm... Your toenail.
132|Yes?
132|Your toenail. Show me.
132|You're really a strange boy.
132|Look here.
132|Yes?
132|See, it's completely healed already.
132|But it's strange. This is strange, Kagenui-san.
132|When I was putting my socks on to leave my house, it hadn't healed this much yet.
132|The reason for that is obvious. Very obvious, Devil-chan.
132|Oh, right. A vampire's powers get stronger at night.
132|And you probably basked in a lot of moonlight too.
132|Moonbathing, rather than sunbathing, heals a vampire's wounds. Yay!
132|So Shinobu's analysis was right after all.
132|Shinobu's theory that I'm turning into a vampire...
132|No, I can't quite decide one way or the other yet... Hey, Yotsugi.
132|What is it, Onee-chan?
132|Here, check this out.
132|Yeah, yeah.
132|Crunch, crunch.
132|No, don't use your teeth! Don't bite down!
132|Quit whining. It's just your small toe.
132|Whine, whine!
132|How is it, Yotsugi?
132|Analyzing.
132|I see. Then, Araragi-kun, while Yotsugi is analyzing the taste of your foot, let's move on to the next step.
132|Lend me your hand.
132|Hand?
132|Yeah. As if you wanted me to read your palm.
132|There.
132|Break Em
132|You're noisy.
132|Well, I did put up a barrier, so no matter how much you scream there won't be any problems.
132|Do what you want.
132|Wh-What did you do that for, Kagenui-san?
132|Just doing this all of a sudden. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!
132|Oh, no, no. Don't just writhe around like that.
132|Think about healing those fingers. Believe that they'll heal.
132|This is a test to check your healing ability.
132|Te-Test?
132|Put in some effort to ideologically and conceptually heal those fingers.
132|Look, those fingers on your right hand? How did they break, how were they broken?
132|They wouldn't glue back together in a month or two, normally.
132|If these fingers don't heal...
132|I won't be able to fondle Hanekawa's breasts!
132|Just how far into puberty are you?
132|But, well, that healing ability, and the way you healed... I got a good look.
132|Yotsugi, what were the results of your analysis?
132|Well, I think I have a general idea now.
132|Shinobu-neesan's theory that he's turning into a vampire is probably correct.
132|However...
132|However?
132|Yeah, however... No, I'm not the one who should tell you the rest.
132|Come on, you saying that just makes me more curious about it.
132|I think I'd like you to call out Shinobu-neesan.
132|The one cooped up in your shadow, Shinobu-neesan.
132|I want to hear the opinion of that demon too.
132|Well, yeah. I'll apologize for standing on her head earlier.
132|Call her out. The one who was once known as Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, call her out here.
132|Sure...
132|If It's Going To Take Some Effort,
132|I Can Just Stick My Arm Into Your Shadow And
132|Pull Her Out Like Some Internal Organ.
132|I'll Grab On With Enough Feeling
132|As If I Was Pulling
132|All Her Blonde Hair Out—
132|Hey, former Heart-under-blade. Sorry about totally stepping on your head earlier.
132|Oh my, it looks like your investigation of my master is now complete. I thank you for doing so in my place.
132|Even people like you come to my lord's aid.
132|The right people really are in the right places of this world.
132|Sorry about that. I didn't want to force you into a situation where you'd have to show off recklessly like that.
132|There was merely a head that looked easy to land on right there.
132|I couldn't help but try to step on it.
132|Please stop that...
132|Wa-Watch your tongue, human. The reason that I will not kill you right now,
132|is the expectation that you will solve the problems ailing my master's body right now. Don't forget that.
132|No, that's why I'm apologizing about stepping on your head.
132|About stepping on the short head of your prideful self.
132|Don't hold it against me. You're so gloomy because you're a night-walker!
132|Sorry, sorry. I'll be careful to not step on it again.
132|Please stop that, Kagenui-san.
132|You give it up too, Shinobu.
132|There's no need to open old wounds by trying to take the past back.
132|Bu-But...
132|Back there, you used your body to cover my head so Kagenui-san wouldn't step on it.
132|That was a devoted act of self-sacrifice.
132|If you think that, you won't hurt your pride right?
132|Oh, you're right.
132|Right, right! I covered you with my body! I'm so cool!
132|I really lost against someone like this?
132|I guess we have all the actors on stage, all the information gathered, and all the answers now.
132|Too bad I can't pause here to challenge the viewers.
132|Let's get on with the Resolution Arc now. Time to unravel the mystery.
132|Unravel the mystery...
132|Very well. Begin.
132|Araragi Koyomi. Devil boy.
132|Your body as of right now, or rather, currently, and slowly, bit by bit,
132|is becoming that of a vampire. That is the current state of it.
132|Becoming a vampire. Hmm.
132|You're more calm than I expected, mister.
132|Well, I mean, I've turned into a vampire a number of times up to this point.
132|It wasn't for nothing that I've buffed up my experience over the past year.
132|Experience, huh?
132|I think you've racked up debuffs for your intelligence rather than experience.
132|Shinobu-neesan, I want to confirm one last thing.
132|You really have no idea what's going on?
132|From your point of view, about the reason why your master, your devil boy of a master,
132|is in a situation like this right now?
132|If I did, I wouldn't rely on you guys.
132|You haven't heard from Oshino-kun either?
132|I haven't heard anything.
132|Well, that figures...
132|What Oshino-kun could never calculate was none other than your own actions, Araragi-kun.
132|Hmm, let's see, Araragi-kun...
132|You turned into a vampire too many times.
132|You buffed your experience too much, which means you debuffed your intelligence by doing too many stupid things.
132|So, Devil-chan.
132|While solving all the incidents in this town, you relied too much on your powers as a vampire.
132|And as a result, your soul is fundamentally and completely independently from that of the former Heart-under-blade,
132|leaning towards the soul of a vampire.
132|Leaning towards...
132|Literally being a vampire, or turning you into one.
132|To make it extremely easy to understand, and direct to boot, Devil-chan...
132|You didn't turn into a vampire too many times, but rather you got too used to turning into one.
132|You got used to the fact that you could.
132|Wait...
132|Among the specialists, some end up becoming aberrations themselves like this.
132|We put a substitute in between, like this for instance, so we don't end up like this.
132|What Oshino-kun couldn't calculate was just that.
132|No, from the beginning nothing was calculated.
132|So I can't say it couldn't be calculated since it wasn't at all.
132|So, it would be something unexpected.
132|The worst part was the snake god, of course.
132|Back then, Devil-chan, you became a vampire way, way, way too much... Virtually every day.
132|Of course...
132|Since Sengoku turned into that...
132|The responsibility for letting that happen to Sengoku was mine.
132|At the very least, I felt responsible... That's why...
132|I have a good grasp of the general situation, though I can't say I have a firm grasp of everything.
132|And so, what do I need to do, Ononoki-chan?
132|What do you mean, what do you need to do?
132|How can I turn back into a human?
132|Devil boy.
132|Ononoki Said.
132|With No Hesitation And No Consideration.
132|With Doll-Like Eyes.
132|She Said In A Doll-Like Manner.
132|It's impossible. There's no way to fix this.
132|itsumo doori no atarimae no hibi wo
132|These normal, ordinary days...
132|itsumade konna fuu ni sugoserundarou
132|I wonder how long we can continue passing our time like this
132|sonna koto kangaeta shunkan kara
132|From the moment I thought about that
132|owari ha hajimarikakechatteru no kana
132|I wondered if the end had already begun
132|yoku ataru uranai toka
132|Let’s blame it on my spot-on fortunes
132|haneta kami no sei ni shite
132|Or on my curled up hair
132|dakedo kyou mo kawarenai mama tachisukumu
132|But I’m frozen in place again today, unable to change
132|kimi no inai sonna sekai ni natte hajimete
132|This is starting to become a world where you don't exist
132|kyou to iu hi wo koukai suru nante iya da
132|I don’t want to grow to regret the day called “today”
132|ima shika nai itsudatte
132|There’s nothing but right now, and even though
132|shitteta noni kyou mo ienakute
132|I’ve always known that, I wasn’t able to say anything today
132|anna hibi ni mou nido to modorenai toshitemo
132|Even if we can never go back to those days
132|nee nando demo atarashiku hajimetai
132|Listen, I want to start things from the beginning, over and over again
132|ima shika nai itsudatte
132|There’s nothing but right now
132|shitteru kara kyou ha iitakute
132|Even though I’ve always known that, I want to tell you today
133|There is no way to return.
133|No way to treat it.
133|Strangely, Ononoki's cruel words, her bleak, grim answer, were rather easy to accept.
133|I see.
133|Yer no disturbed?
133|Well...
133|It's just deserts, I suppose, for the past half year.
133|I relied on my vampirism as others would on energy drinks so that I could fight oddities with my immortality.
133|That punishment—
133|Punishment?
133|That recompense seems only logical.
133|Yes, recompense.
133|Recompense, huh?
133|Well, ye chose tae use and rely on that power,
133|so I suppose I agree.
133|That said, ye haven't lost all that makes ye human just yet.
133|Which means?
133|There isnae any way tae heal ye or return ye tae being human,
133|but we can make sure that yer vampirization progresses no further.
133|Yes, I suppose that is so.
133|We can maintain the status quo.
133|How exactly, Ononoki?
133|Never again
133|use the powers of a vampire.
133|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
133|as the stars twinkle above
133|Yotsugi Doll
133|I guess this is enough for me
133|I'm sure there's a reason
133|There's more to this world
133|than the things I can see
133|The reason you laugh
133|is my reason to cry
133|Getting logical and serious about this won't let us take another step
133|I'll make a wish upon that shooting star
133|Too bad I'm not sure anymore
133|what I want for the future
133|That's how we pass our days
133|Let's go to bed and to hell with making sense
133|My heart pounds
133|when I eat this sparkling orange mint
133|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
133|as the stars twinkle above
133|Naturally, you can continue to offer sustenance to Shinobu.
133|You can keep being a battery feeding into the shadow.
133|It would not pose any problem,
133|but
133|you must pace yourselves,
133|and obviously any transition to vampirism must be avoided.
133|Whatever the situation.
133|Never again use the powers of a vampire...
133|If something were to challenge me to the point I needed it,
133|would I be able to abstain from using it and uphold my humanity?
133|That train of thought is best abandoned.

133|If ye were tae walk down the path of bein' an immortal oddity,
133|ye'd leave me no choice but tae exterminate ye.
133|I'd have ye meet yer maker.
133|And should that day come I would see you to yours, exorcist.
133|My master's death would unshackle my bonds,
133|and you and yours would come to find me anyway.
133|Aye, we'd have a square go.
133|Ye certainly wouldnae be considered harmless at that point.
133|Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
133|Why create such tension? Shinobu? Sis?
133|You see, Devil Brother, I would like to ask something of you as a friend.
133|I want you to promise me that you will never, ever again make use of your vampirism.
133|Please swear that you will act without relying on immortality, whatever the difficulty.
133|Swear to me you will live life like a human being.
133|The way a human being would.
133|Swear it.
133|Yotsugi spoke plainly.
133|I'm merely an artifact spirit.
133|If Sis commands it, I would have to fight you.
133|I may have my personal misgivings, but they wouldn't change anything.
133|That's how I was created.
133|Ononoki...
133|Haven't you had enough of immortality?
133|As a reanimated corpse, I'm probably worth trusting when I say that immortality isn't as great as you'd think.
133|I mean, even if you leave us out of the equation,
133|isn't this your last chance to pretend to be a normal human
133|and live a normal life?
133|Very well, Ononoki. And Kagenui.
133|I accept.
133|I'll swear it.
133|I swear I will never again rely on my vampirism to confront oddities.
133|Are you satisfied?
133|Sure. Truly.
133|That's great news.
133|Great news for our job, for yer life, and for the former Heart-under-Blade's life.
133|Your vow was somewhat lackluster.
133|Lackluster... Perhaps.
133|I have no idea if it's a promise I could even keep if the situation were to arise.
133|Whatever I say now, if Senjougahara or Hanekawa were dead or dying next to me,
133|and if I could undo it using vampirism,
133|then I'm sure I'd know what to do.
133|I would prioritize the situation at hand.
133|That's what defines Araragi Koyomi.
133|Well then, Kagenui. Ononoki. Thank you.
133|Aye aye, yer welco—
133|Hold up!
133|I need tae dae a bit more research on yer body.
133|Really?
133|Um, Shinobu?
133|What is it?
133|I'm sorry for the inconveniences that will follow.
133|You don't have to apologize.
133|I've made this abundantly clear already, but we share a destiny, you and I.
133|Our symbiosis itself is rare and highly convenient.
133|Compensation must be provided, as you yourself have said.
133|I don't think of it as a difficulty or an imposition.
133|All right, can we postpone it until tomorrow?
133|I guess it has to be tonight, right?
133|Aye, of course.
133|Tonight, as the moon is high and yer vampirism peaks, we must examine it.
133|Don't worry, Devil Brother.
133|It will be mostly my job to do the research.
133|You can be sure that I'll be examining you in utmost detail.
133|I won't do what Sister did and break your fingers when you let your guard down.
133|I didn't consider that likely, but the more you talk about it, the more wary I am.
133|Wait.
133|Considering that she was gnawing on my toe, perhaps she will lick me down.
133|This is gonna be glorious.
133|What's with the grin?
133|You're creeping me out.
133|Why don't we get this goin'?
133|Do ye want tae call home?
133|No need.
133|My parents practice free-range parenting.
133|Even my vaguely annoying younger sisters are at a slumber party right now.
133|Koyo's Kamishibai Theatre
133|Although I originally meant to get my sisters, and Tsukihi in particular, to the safety of Kanbaru's house,
133|I feel like I ended up doing Kanbaru a big favor for the most part.
133|The End
133|Very well, then. I'll report tae Gaen that nothing serious transpired.
133|I guess that's true.
133|Nothing serious at all.
133|Business as usual.
133|It doesn't stand out much in the months since we lost Sengoku Nadeko.
133|Perfectly normal.
133|Yotsugi. Hand us the phone.
133|Here, Sister.
133|I do regret not bein' able to exterminate ye here,
133|but for now I'll say that it gives me at least some joy that I could stop an emergin' immortal oddity
133|before it got out of hand.
133|Hey, Kagenui.
133|Sir?
133|Um, well... I wanted to ask this during the summer holidays as well...
133|Why, exactly, do you want to kill immortal oddities so much?
133|What?
133|What did ye just say?
133|Well, I was just wondering why you want to kill immortal oddities so much.
133|Isn't that awfully specific as far as oddities are concerned?
133|Let's see...
133|That hasnae really occurred tae me.
133|Aren't almost all oddities—monsters, if ye will—void of life, anyway?
133|What d'you say, Yotsugi?
133|Sure.
133|The definition is rather vague.
133|Depending on how you interpret the word "immortal,"
133|you could very well say that your realm of interest encompasses most oddities.
133|Besides, I'm only one of many specialists who deal wae immortal oddities.
133|Course, I believe I only know of one other so intent on killing them, though.
133|Just one, huh?
133|He's a wee bit of a hermit these days, so nae need tae worry.
133|He's cut ties wae Gaen's group; a true loner.
133|What's wrong, Araragi?
133|Do ye want tae segue into a side story episode about what made me who I am?
133|Not gonna lie, I am curious as to the reason why.
133|It's my opinion that ye would be more interested in hearing Yotsugi's.
133|What do you mean, Kagenui?
133|Yes, hello. Kagenui speaking.
133|Ah, wait a second. Just a second.
133|I was just about tae bring this up with Araragi.
133|Aw naw.
133|That'd be too cruel even for me.
133|Aye, but Tadatsuru is...
133|Oh, I see.
133|I'll be sure tae tell Araragi.
133|Is there anything that we need tae dae?
133|Or can we sit back and observe?
133|Goodbye.
133|Araragi. I bring ye terrible news in terrible times.
133|That was Gaen, though, wasn't it?
133|Ye can have Yotsugi for a while.
133|Go now while there's still time.
133|Where do you want me to go?
133|Tae Kanbaru Suruga's house.
133|The house where the daughter of Gaen's sister, Gaen Tooe, resides.
133|Ye should go meet up with yer sisters there.
133|Though it's certainly a possibility that they may no even be there.
133|Shall we go, Devil Brother?
133|No... Wait.
133|The drastically changing pressure and oxygen from Unlimited Rulebook is too rough on my body right now.
133|I'm sorry, Shinobu.
133|Can I have your shoulder?
133|Very well.
133|Shouldn't there be three futons?
133|What is it, Devil Brother?
133|Well, look, Ononoki.
133|Try taking it.
133|But what if it's a clue?
133|It should be fine, if what I think is true.
133|Okay.
133|Hey, Ononoki!
133|I knew it.
133|You knew it?
133|This was perpetrated by someone I know.
133|Sister knows him too.
133|A confession?
133|So this is a kidnapping—
133|No. Not necessarily.
133|The goal could be something bigger than kidnapping.
133|He likes carnival tricks like this.
133|His desire to startle others is rather evil.
133|The reason he made his message a crane is rather straightforward.
133|Straightforward
133|And that is?
133|It's a bird.
133|A phoenix is a bird.
133|Legend has it that the crane lives for a thousand years,
133|and this flock of cranes
133|symbolizes your sister Tsukihi.
133|Teori Tadatsuru.
133|He uses dolls.
133|Tadatsuru?
133|But...
133|Tadatsuru uses dolls. A specialist.
133|He specializes in immortal oddities like me.
133|And he kidnapped my sisters and Kanbaru?
133|What is he after?
133|It's my feeling that Tadatsuru's driven by a personal animus, and his work is substandard.
133|So contrary to what ye may be thinking, all is not lost.
133|However...
133|However?
133|I should remind ye that using yer vampiric power to resolve this is off limits.
133|Yer vampirism has tae remain in check.
133|The former Heart-under-Blade has tae sit this one out, too.
133|Okay.
133|It's a little weird.
133|What is, Araragi?
133|I wanted this exact thing to happen during spring break, so that Shinobu's power would remain sealed,
133|and before I knew it, I was using it myself.
133|It seems that I wound up using it like it was my own, when it should have felt transient and borrowed.
133|Perhaps this is divine retribution.
133|Divine retribution?
133|I don't know.
133|I do think you're reaping what you've sown here,
133|but is it really divine retribution?
133|What do you mean?
133|The timing's a wee bit too convenient tae call it divine retribution.
133|Such convenient timing's either the result of a ludicrous coincidence or human agency.
133|This was not the work of the heavens,
133|but of mortal mankind.
133|As soon as yer reflection fades from the mirror and ye become more vampire than human,
133|yer sisters and Suruga are abducted by an acquaintance ae mine.
133|Let's not be so vain as tae call that divine.
133|It seems like lately, the debt collectors are coming for you all at once.
133|For me, that's always the case.
133|There are things we build, things we set aside for another time...
133|Things that crumble to pieces.
133|Perhaps someone pulled out the wrong piece. Like Jenga.
133|Gaen's and Yotsugi's accounts would agree.
133|Is Ononoki's account related to her encounter with the darkness? With Hachikuji Mayoi?
133|Yes. She was the very definition of something left for later.
133|And her story is the very definition of something that fell to pieces.
133|Can I ask you something, Kagenui?
133|What's up?
133|Excuse my expression,
133|but is that Teori Tadatsuru a sort of self-proclaimed superhero who values justice above all else?
133|The sort of guy that believes that there's justice in the world to save it?
133|Does he entertain such an ideology?
133|Ideology?
133|Now that's a riot.
133|It's got nothin' tae dae with that.
133|If we were to assume that Tadatsuru had something like an ideology, it'd be aesthetic curiosity.
133|And personally, I'd say anyone who values his pursuits as aesthetic is aff their heed.
133|He feels that anythin' no created by God himself are true beauty.
133|He feels that oddities created by human beings are beautiful.
133|He fancies himself somethin' of an artist.
133|Not that he is.
133|I suppose what drives him isnae an ideology but an obsession.
133|Yer sisters and Suruga are safe.
133|Well, at least safer than they would be if I went for them.
133|Why would someone who considers oddities beautiful oppose them?
133|You might say he's a wee bit like Oshino.
133|He'd rather mediate than exterminate.
133|A middleman. Somethin' like that.
133|Doesn't that make him the worst possible enemy for me?
133|Don't make everything about yourself.
133|First it was yer power, now yer lack of.
133|It's egocentric.
133|Egocentric.
133|Ye shouldnae wallow in yer own misfortune.
133|Yer sisters and Suruga were abducted by an acquaintance of mine for reasons unknown.
133|That makes ye nae more than a victim.
133|Hypothetically speaking, even if somethin' like divine retribution existed,
133|it'd only concern you and yer loss of humanity.
133|It's got nothin' tae dae wae the other three.
133|Don't ye agree, Yotsugi?
133|Yes.
133|Then we have to rescue the three who are innocent.
133|I'd have done it anyway.
133|Will you help,
133|Kagenui?
133|Rescue those three?
133|Gaen told me tae help ye, so aye.
133|I'll help.
133|However, just so we're clear: I willnae be involvin' myself personally.
133|All my abilities are specialized tae defeat immortal oddities.
133|They cannae be used on human beings.
133|Oh, come on.
133|Yotsugi will tag along.
133|And I'll help ye with my sagacity.
133|First, we need tae examine those strings of paper cranes.
133|If a message in there exists, it'd be one addressed tae you, Araragi.
133|For me?
133|It's hard for me to fully know his grasp of the situation,
133|but you are ultimately his target, Araragi.
133|I am? But I thought Tadatsuru's goal was—
133|You and the former Heart-under-Blade.
133|Oshino had the both of ye recognized as harmless,
133|but that recognition's only meaningful within Gaen's realm of influence.
133|Tadatsuru isnae bound by it.
133|This is the worst possible timing.
133|Right when Shinobu and I are unable to put up a fight, someone appears who would challenge us directly.
133|I sense how poor—
133|in an artificial way,
133|in a contrived way—the timing is.
133|Shrine of the Polar Snake
133|Does it give a time?
133|Sure doesnae.
133|Has a place on it though.
133|Seems pretty obvious that tonight is the implication.
133|A little after 1 AM.
133|Ideally we'd have this done and dusted before dawn.
133|Araragi, yer mission is to get yer sisters and Gaen's niece home before dawn and put them in their futons.
133|Okay, Ononoki.
133|I'm sorry we have to do this again, but can we take the quick route?
133|The Shrine of the Polar Snake lies—
133|Ye might want tae reconsider that.
133|The night is clear, so ye'd be visible fae miles away.
133|He'd do ye in before ye could blink.
133|So, should we jump near the mountain and hike up?
133|I'll take the low route.
133|There's nae need tae wait up for me.
133|Shrine of the Polar Snake
133|Decide independently when ye want tae head in.
133|Ye've got full autonomy.
133|And I wouldnae offer ye any real assistance anyway.
133|Okay.
133|Let's go, then.
133|By the way, Ononoki.
133|Could you, perhaps, fly a little bit lower in altitude?
133|No low altitudes.
133|I could fly more slowly. Do you want that?
133|No.
133|It's fine.
133|Just jump.
133|How much longer, do you think,
133|can we live our ordinary lives like this?
133|Perhaps that thought alone
133|invites the end of it
133|I blame my misfortune on little things in life
133|instead of taking a step forward
133|You had to be gone from my life
133|before I started treasuring my days
133|I always tell myself that my time is limited,
133|but could never confess my love
133|Even if our days together are over,
133|I will find happiness again
133|Now I know that my time is limited,
133|and so I want to confess my love
134|Vam
134|pire
134|There's no way to fix this. There's no way to go back.
134|Strangely enough, that cruel declaration Ononoki-chan gave me,
134|Vam
134|that hopeless answer lacking in any salvation whatsoever,
134|once she gave it to me, I could accept it easily.
134|Vampire
134|I see...
134|You're not going to throw a fit?
134|No, well...
134|I was pretty reckless these past six months or so.
134|I turned into a vampire as if it were natural, like drinking an energy drink.
134|I relied on the power of immortality to fight against aberrations. As atonement for that...
134|Atonement?
134|I should have to pay compensation for it.
134|Right, It's Compensation.
134|Compensation, huh?
134|Well, you took it on yourself to wield that power, so I guess that couldn't be helped.
134|I guess you have no choice but to be satisfied with that answer. But, that being said,
134|it's not like you've lost everything human about you yet.
134|You mean?
134|There is no way to rewind it, or to fix it.
134|But there is a way to stop your metamorphosis into a vampire from going any further.
134|Well, you know... Yeah... There is a method to keep the status quo.
134|And what is that method, Ononoki-chan?
134|That is to no longer rely on your vampire powers from now on.

134|Of course, you can keep on providing nutrition to Shinobu-neesan.
134|It's fine to keep charging her battery through your shadow.
134|Something like that is no longer an issue for you.
134|However.
134|You have to consider the pace at which you do it.
134|And you should, of course, avoid actually turning into a vampire.
134|No matter the situation.
134|I can't rely on my vampire powers anymore.
134|For instance... While I'm human, if there's something I absolutely have to do,
134|that I could only do with my vampire powers, could I stop myself from using them?
134|It's better for you if you don't say anything else, and you don't think any further either.

134|If you turn into an immortal aberration any more than you have right now,
134|I will have to kill you as a specialist.
134|I'll have to totally kill you.
134|When that happens, I'll kill you, specialist.
134|If my master were to die, if he is killed, I will be released from my restraints.
134|Once I regain the powers I once had, I'm sure you will come after me anyway.
134|Well, if that day comes, I'm sure we'll end up fighting each other,
134|since the acknowledgement that you're harmless would be dissolved at that point.
134|That is something further into the future, Onee-chan, Shinobu-neesan.
134|Why are you getting so riled up about it now?
134|Devil boy.
134|I want to ask this of you as a friend, devil boy.
134|Right here, right now.
134|Never again.
134|Never again, I want you to promise me you'll never rely on the powers of a vampire.
134|No matter what hardships you face, swear you'll act without relying on the powers of the immortal.
134|That you will live life from here on out like a human would.
134|That you'll live like a human.
134|I want you to swear to me.
134|Ononoki Quietly Said So.
134|I am only a shikigami after all...
134|so if Onee-chan tells me to do it, I'll have to fight even you, Devil-chan.
134|I have my personal feelings, but they're just there. That's how I was made.
134|Ononoki-chan...
134|It's fine, isn't it? You've experienced being immortal plenty.
134|There's no doubt about this because I'm telling you as a corpse. Being immortal isn't as good as it seems.
134|Or rather, if you don't mind us and think about it, that's how it should be.
134|This level is the limit for you, Devil-chan, for you to be human.
134|To pretend to be human.
134|And to continue to live, isn't it?
134|I understand, Ononoki-chan. And Kagenui-san,
134|I understand. I swear.
134|I won't borrow the power of the vampire and use it to stand against an aberration ever again.
134|That's fine, right?
134|Yeah, that's right. Exactly as you said.
134|You'd help me out a lot if you could do that.
134|For our work, for your life, and for the life of the former Heart-under-blade.
134|That's a pretty shallow oath.
134|If you say it's shallow, perhaps it is.
134|I myself don't have absolute confidence in whether or not I can uphold this oath when push comes to shove.
134|Because, in the end, no matter how many oaths I make,
134|if, right in front of my eyes, Senjougahara or Hanekawa were about to die,
134|or were in a similar situation,
134|if I can prevent that from happening by turning into a vampire, I will have no doubts in my mind.
134|I wouldn't think about the consequences, and only think about what's right before my eyes.
134|That's the kind of guy Araragi Koyomi is.
134|Then, Kagenui-san, Ononoki-chan... Thank you very much.
134|Yeah, thanks!
134|No, that's not it.
134|We still have to check your body out again. We do, down to the small details.
134|Is that so?
134|Um, Shinobu...
134|What is it?
134|I'm sure I'll be troubling you for a while... So, I'm sorry.
134|It's nothing you need to apologize for. I've already said it to the point of boredom.
134|You and I are in the same boat. We share a destiny...
134|Of course, the fact that you and I are here together in itself is a great miracle.
134|It's just like you said, and even with just that, it's a given that there's that high a cost for it.
134|I Don't Feel It Is Much Of An Inconvenience Nor A Handicap.
134|I guess waiting for tomorrow or later than that isn't an option right now, of course?
134|Right. That's obvious.
134|It's during this moonlit night, when your vampire strength is at its peak, that we need to measure the critical point.
134|Don't worry, Devil-chan. It's primarily my job to do the examinations.
134|I'll do it myself.
134|I'll attentively examine every inch of you.
134|I won't give you any tests like the one Onee-chan did earlier,
134|when she broke your bones by surprise.
134|I hadn't thought about that possibility,
134|but on second thought, a full-blown examination is kinda daunting.
134|No, wait. Could it be, that Ononoki-chan will do it like she sucked on my toes,
134|that she'll service me by licking my entire body, or rather, that she simply performs examinations in that fashion.
134|Thinking about it like that, my heart is racing.
134|Why are you grinning like that, Devil-chan... It's creepy.
134|Well then, let's get ready.
134|Is it all right if you don't call home?
134|It's fine. They leave me alone for the most part.
134|My naggy little sisters are having a pajama party tonight too.
134|Koyoi Pictorial Story Theater
134|For me, sending them to Kanbaru's house was meant to protect them. Especially Tsukihi.
134|However, when I reflect back on it, I think I gave my underclassman, Kanbaru Suruga, a big service.
134|The End
134|Well, I'll contact Gaen-senpai just in case. I'll tell her it ended up not being a big deal.
134|That's right. It ended up not being much. It didn't.
134|That's how it's supposed to be.
134|Compared to the few months that Sengoku Nadeko lost, it's like nothing happened.
134|Yotsugi, the cell phone.
134|Here you go, Onee-chan.
134|Well, it's a shame that I couldn't totally kill you, Araragi.
134|But to think that I defanged an immortal aberration before it was born,
134|I'll be satisfied with that for today.
134|You know, Kagenui-san.
134|What is it?
134|Well, uh, let's see...
134|This is actually something I wanted to ask you back during summer break, too...
134|Why do you want to kill immortal aberrations so much, Kagenui-san?
134|Yes?
134|What was that, mister?
134|Well, I mean...
134|I just wondered why you wanted to kill immortal aberrations so much, Kagenui-san...
134|Isn't that strange for a specialist of aberrations?
134|Is that so?
134|Who knows, it might not be that bad, right?
134|In the first place, aberrations, in other words ghosts, are all pretty much dead to begin with.
134|Right, Yotsugi?
134|Right.
134|The rules about that are a little fuzzy, Devil-chan.
134|Depending on how you interpret "immortal," you might even be able to say,
134|that Onee-chan's specialty is basically every aberration out there.
134|Honestly, it's not like there aren't any other specialists that concentrate on immortal aberrations.
134|Well, it's true that I only know about one other guy like me that just wants to kill them all,
134|no matter what.
134|So there's at least one...
134|But that guy's a total hermit, so you don't have to worry about him, Araragi-kun.
134|He strayed away from Gaen-senpai's group, so he's truly astray.
134|What is it, Araragi-kun?
134|You want to see a side story-esque episode showing how I went down this path?
134|To be honest, it's on my mind so much I must be mindfully curious.
134|Well, instead of worrying about my reasons, if anything,
134|you guys need to worry about Yotsugi's reasons.
134|Kagenui-san, what do you mean by that—
134|Call Length
134|Yes, hello, this is Kagenui...
134|Oh, wait a sec, hold on just a second.
134|I was just about to talk about him to Araragi-kun...
134|Senpai, you can't be serious. That's just way too cruel, no matter what you think.
134|Yeah... Yeah... But that guy Tadatsuru, right now...
134|All right. I got it. I'll tell that to Araragi-kun.
134|Is it okay if I stay like this? Like, if I continue to go on with the flow.
134|Bye.
134|Araragi-kun, the worst possible timing brings the worst possible news.
134|Eh? B-But that call just now was from Gaen-san, right?
134|I'll lend Yotsugi to you for a while, so head over there as soon as possible.
134|As soon as possible... To where?
134|To Kanbaru Suruga's house.
134|The Kanbaru house, where Gaen Tooe's daughter, Gaen-senpai's little sister lives.
134|Go see your little sisters, who are there right now, as soon as possible.
134|No... To be precise, there's already a chance that they're not there anymore.
134|Let's go, devil boy.
134|No... Hold on a sec...
134|Right now, I don't have the physical strength,
134|to keep up with the pressure and oxygen differences caused by travel from Unlimited Rulebook.
134|Shinobu... Sorry, can you lend me your shoulder?
134|I guess I have no choice.
134|No... There's got to be three futons laid out.
134|What's wrong, devil boy?
134|Well, Ononoki-chan...
134|This.
134|Devil-chan, pick this up for a second.
134|Huh? But if it's supposed to be some sort of clue...
134|It's fine, devil boy, if it's what I think it is.
134|All right.
134|H-Hey, Ononoki-chan!
134|Just as I thought.
134|J-Just as you thought?
134|It's the doing of someone we know. Someone Onee-chan and I know.
134|An intent to commit a crime?
134|No, but he already kidnapped them?
134|No, that's not it.
134|The kidnapping is only the means, and it means there's more to it.
134|That guy likes doing stuff like that magic trick.
134|He's a guy that likes surprising people with malicious intent.
134|But the reason why he left a message in the form of a crane is pretty clear.
134|Is Pretty Straightforward
134|And by that you mean?
134|A bird.
134|The shape of a bird.
134|The phoenix.
134|In other words, that crane, that group of birds said to live a thousand years,
134|points to your little sister, Araragi Tsukihi.
134|Teori Tadatsuru. A dollmaster.
134|Tadatsuru... was it?
134|Tadatsuru? But...
134|Tadatsuru
134|Yoduru
134|Yotsugi
134|Tadatsuru is a dollmaster, and, well, a specialist.
134|And just like me, he's a specialist that specializes in immortal aberrations.
134|You're saying he was the one that kidnapped my little sisters and my underclassman?
134|Then what's his objective?
134|All I can say is that Tadatsuru tends to act on grudges, and he's a softie when it comes to work.
134|So the situation isn't as hopeless as you may be thinking right now, Araragi-kun.
134|However...
134|However, what?
134|You can't deal with this situation by relying on your vampire power this time.
134|Things aren't going to go like they usually do. You need to engrave that in your heart.
134|Before you understand the situation and get angry.
134|It also means that the former Heart-under-blade can't turn into a vampire either.
134|Yes,
134|this is something of a strange story.
134|Hm? What is, Araragi-kun?
134|Well, in the first place, I had the goal of sealing away Shinobu's powers back in that spring break.
134|and that was why I wanted a solution like that.
134|But before I knew it I used Shinobu's powers to solve things.
134|That power was temporary: I had just borrowed it. But before I realized it,
134|I was using it like it was normal, like it was mine.
134|It may be natural that I would receive one divine punishment after another with this.
134|Divine punishment?
134|I don't know about that.
134|It's true that you were asking for this situation to happen, devil boy.
134|But whether or not this is divine punishment...
134|What do you mean by that?
134|Well, the timing is too perfect for this to be divine punishment.
134|When the timing is too perfect, if it really isn't just a coincidence, then it's most likely the doing of some person.
134|Not The Doings Of Heaven
134|But The Doings Of A Human
134|On the day you can't see your reflection anymore,
134|in other words, the day your metamorphosis made you more vampire than human,
134|your underclassman and your little sisters were assaulted by someone I know. That's...
134|That feels like too many coincidences at once.
134|Lately, it isn't so strange that a bunch of unpaid tabs come knocking all at once though.
134|Feels like everything goes like that lately.
134|It's as if what I had built up, what I had hidden away...
134|Is all crashing down on me at once.
134|Maybe some joker crashed it down on you? Like a game of Jenga.
134|Listening to Gaen-senpai's story, and listening to Yotsugi's story, it feels that way.
134|Ononoki-chan's story... Maybe that was the story of the "darkness" the other day...
134|The story about Hachikuji Mayoi?
134|Right. That story is the embodiment of what I hid away.
134|And the embodiment of what's crashing down on me.
134|Can I ask one thing, Kagenui-san?
134|What?
134|Um, this is a weird way to put it, but this Teori Tadatsuru guy,
134|is he the type that can't forgive mistakes or injustice? An ally of justice?
134|Someone who thinks there is a right shape for this world, and that it should be in that right shape...
134|Does he have such ideals?
134|Ideals?
134|Don't make me laugh.
134|He has no link to things like that. Let's say that Tadatsuru had things such as ideals,
134|if I think they would be a curiosity of aesthetics. Though I don't want to describe it with the word "aesthetic."
134|The sensibility to think that it's the things God didn't create that are beautiful.
134|Someone with the sensibility to think that man-made existences called aberrations are beautiful.
134|Someone who thinks he's an artist, and that's where his softness comes in.
134|In that aspect, he doesn't have ideals, but instead some obsession.
134|That's why your little sisters and your underclassman are still safe.
134|At least, safer than they would be with me going after them.
134|But why is someone who has the sensibility to think
134|that aberrations are beautiful going after aberrations as a specialist?
134|He may be more like Oshino-kun than others.
134|It's not like defeating them, but more like mediating here and there.
134|A mediater, a middleman, I guess.
134|So, as the opponent I need to face right now...
134|This Tadatsuru guy sounds like the perfect specialist.
134|Don't drown.
134|I mean to yourself, not to your powers. That's just narcissism.
134|Narcissism...
134|What I mean is that you shouldn't drown yourself with a tragic situation.
134|All that happened is that some weirdo kidnapped your two little sisters and your underclassman.
134|In this situation, you're a one-sided victim.
134|For argument's sake, let's say divine punishment exists.
134|That would only affect you and how you're losing your humanity.
134|Those three being targeted is completely unrelated.
134|Right, Yotsugi?
134|Right.
134|I have to save those three who are completely unrelated to this, then.
134|In any case, I have to do it.
134|Kagenui-san, um...
134|Will you help me? If nothing else, to save those three.
134|Gaen-senpai told me I should, so I will.
134|I'll just go with the flow in this situation.
134|Let me say this, though: I can't get involved directly.
134|All my powers are meant for killing immortal aberrations.
134|I can't use them against humans.
134|Don't give me that look. I'll still lend you Yotsugi.
134|I'll lend you some information too.
134|What you need to do first, in any case, is to look closely at those thousand origami cranes.
134|If those are a message, that message should be for you, Araragi-kun.
134|For me?
134|I don't know how much he knows about the situation, but...
134|Araragi-kun, Tadatsuru's objective is you, basically.
134|Me? No, but, Tadatsuru's goal is...
134|You, and the former Heart-under-blade.
134|Oshino-kun's acknowledgement that the two of you are harmless,
134|is only acknowledged inside of Gaen-senpai's network.
134|It won't matter for Tadatsuru, who's outside of it.
134|Which means, this really was the worst possible timing for this.
134|Right as Shinobu and I get into a situation where we can't fight,
134|someone who's really targeting us shows up.
134|Artificial
134|Intentional
134|And Malicious—
134|Is How This Bad Timing Feels
134|Shinobu Is Inside The Shadow
134|North Shirahebi Shrine
134|There's no specified time?
134|Nope. The only thing that is specified is the location.
134|But if you think about it, it has to be sometime tonight.
134|It's a little past one in the morning. I'd like to get things settled before sunrise.
134|Araragi-kun, your mission this time is
134|to take your two little sisters and your underclassman, Gaen-senpai's niece,
134|back to Kanbaru's house before sunrise, and toss them in their futons.
134|Then, I'd hate to ask Ononoki-chan, but can you do one more jump to give me a shortcut over there?
134|The location of North Shirahebi Shrine is—
134|You probably shouldn't be doing that.
134|Landing from above, attacking from the sky where nothing can hide you.
134|You'll be seen so clearly that you'll be taken out in one shot.
134|Then, Ononoki-chan will jump us close to the mountain,
134|and... I guess... We'll climb up the mountain by foot?
134|I'll catch up to you with the standard route.
134|North Shirahebi Shrine
134|But, you shouldn't wait for me to join up with you.
134|You'll need to go in at your own timing to save the hostages.
134|You need to move at your own discretion.
134|Even if we joined up, it's not like we'll be able to do some team play.
134|I understand. Then...
134|By the way, Ononoki-chan, just a bit is fine, a tiny bit is fine... Could you fly a little closer to the ground?
134|It's impossible to go at low-altitude.
134|I can go slower, though. Would you prefer that?
134|No.
134|You don't have to.
134|Blast us over there!
134|itsumo doori no atarimae no hibi wo
134|These normal, ordinary days...
134|itsumade konna fuu ni sugoserundarou
134|I wonder how long we can continue passing our time like this
134|sonna koto kangaeta shunkan kara
134|From the moment I thought about that
134|owari ha hajimarikakechatteru no kana
134|I wondered if the end had already begun
134|yoku ataru uranai toka
134|Let’s blame it on my spot-on fortunes
134|haneta kami no sei ni shite
134|Or on my curled up hair
134|dakedo kyou mo kawarenai mama tachisukumu
134|But I’m frozen in place again today, unable to change
134|kimi no inai sonna sekai ni natte hajimete
134|This is starting to become a world where you don't exist
134|kyou to iu hi wo koukai suru nante iya da
134|I don’t want to grow to regret the day called “today”
134|ima shika nai itsudatte
134|There’s nothing but right now, and even though
134|shitteta noni kyou mo ienakute
134|I’ve always known that, I wasn’t able to say anything today
134|anna hibi ni mou nido to modorenai toshitemo
134|Even if we can never go back to those days
134|nee nando demo atarashiku hajimetai
134|Listen, I want to start things from the beginning, over and over again
134|ima shika nai itsudatte
134|There’s nothing but right now
134|shitteru kara kyou ha iitakute
134|Even though I’ve always known that, I want to tell you today
135|My, aren't you late, Araragi?
135|My beloved Araragi.
135|I waited for such a long time.
135|until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical. All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady. They became quieter. Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.
135|Hey, Ougi.
135|Push Button for Signal
135|Schoolgirls shouldn't be out so late at night.
135|You're quite the foolish one.
135|I'll get you home.
135|By launching me through the sky?
135|I'll pass.
135|I don't have a home to get to anyway.
135|Push Button to Cross
135|I mean,
135|I only wanted to encourage you on your way to the battlefield,
135|so I waited here since this morning.
135|Since this morning?
135|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
135|as the stars twinkle above
135|Yotsugi Doll
135|I guess this is enough for me
135|I'm sure there's a reason
135|There's more to this world
135|than the things I can see
135|The reason you laugh
135|is my reason to cry
135|Getting logical and serious about this won't let us take another step
135|I'll make a wish upon that shooting star
135|Too bad I'm not sure anymore
135|what I want for the future
135|That's how we pass our days
135|Let's go to bed and to hell with making sense
135|My heart pounds
135|when I eat this sparkling orange mint
135|My heart pounds fast in the dusk
135|as the stars twinkle above
135|Huh? I can't see her.
135|Where's your blonde loli slave?
135|Doesn't the setting make you powerless without her?
135|I feel like there was a time where I could do things without her powers.
135|These days, though, you're right. That's what the setting is.
135|And I'm not ashamed of it.
135|Relying on others is good.
135|You relied on them too much, didn't you?
135|Didn't the old man talk about this a lot?
135|What was it...?
135|Y'know?
135|That thing he said almost like a mantra...
135|Remember?
135|What was it again?
135|Well, well, well, well...
135|Oh, she definitely remembers.
135|People can't help other people.
135|I can't help you.
135|You're just gonna have to save yourself, Araragi.
135|Something like that.
135|Yes, yes, exactly.
135|How could I forget?
135|How careless.
135|I should remember his mantra.
135|Yes. His mantra.
135|Not mine.
135|I don't live with regrets.
135|Amazingly, I should say.
135|I don't feel like I was careless, foolish, or that I made a mistake.
135|Yes, I suppose.
135|You would have done the same with foreknowledge, Araragi.
135|That's precisely the reason.
135|Reason for what?
135|I think the reason I'm here in the first place is because I'm drawn to that aspect of you, Araragi.
135|You can really twist things.
135|Twist? Twist what?
135|Oh, this and that.
135|Things that shouldn't get twisted.
135|Maybe I just hate the things that get twisted, I guess.
135|I like it when the scales are in balance, equilibrium.
135|I want to return things to their nature.
135|Push Button to Cross
135|Well, it seems to me you're still relying on others.
135|Like this little girl here.
135|How low does one have to go to seek aid from a little girl?
135|Yes, quite low.
135|But you saw it yourself.
135|She isn't just an ordinary—
135|I know.
135|You told me before.
135|Push Button for Signal
135|Did I?
135|I suppose I did.
135|Push Button to Cross
135|Then why did she call her a little girl?
135|So long.
135|You've gotten more mature, Araragi.
135|Don't you think so?
135|Don't you think that you really grew as a person these past few months?
135|I don't think you could've kept your cool back then.
135|Didn't you shut yourself in the gym supply room to cry after you were told
135|you couldn't turn back into a human during spring break?
135|How can you be so calm now, I wonder?
135|I think you traded away so much, sacrificed so many things,
135|all for your personal growth.
135|That may be.
135|However, Ougi.
135|I don't believe that it puts a positive spin on failure, injustice, sacrifice, or sadness.
135|Nor should I believe it.
135|If possible, I'd like to grow through success.
135|I guess that's obvious.
135|Do you think it's possible that she duped Tadatsuru into exorcising oddities to watch you struggle?
135|That she's the final boss?
135|What did you just say, Ononoki?
135|Ah, I didn't say a word.
135|It was just a shot in the dark.
135|Even if I were correct, we wouldn't know her motive.
135|Well, I guess she mentioned her motive.
135|"I want to return things to their nature."
135|Well, how do you "return to your nature?"
135|Who dictates what's correct?
135|I'm an oddity, a familiar, a corpse, an artifact spirit.
135|There's nothing really "natural" about it, right?
135|I exist by using every trick in the book.
135|I've outwitted death.
135|That said, the same applies to all humans to some degree.
135|Do you want to know more about Tadatsuru?
135|Honestly? Can't say I do.
135|Even though he abducted three people that you treasure?
135|Yes.
135|The ideal turn of events would be sneaking in and getting all three down the mountain before he notices.
135|Yes, that would be best if it worked out.
135|But doesn't that only postpone the resolution?
135|It's a vicious cycle.
135|Don't you have to convince him?
135|Sister gave you the impression he specialized in immortal oddities like she does,
135|but the nuance of the word "immortal" is a little different for him.
135|Sister specializes in immortal but living oddities.
135|Tadatsuru is after dead oddities.
135|That's the reason the two don't get along.
135|Tadatsuru prefers beings that have no life, like dolls.
135|Oddities like I am are artificial.
135|Gaen came up with the plan.
135|Kagenui Yozuru, Kaiki Deishuu, Oshino Meme, and Teori Tadatsuru helped her with the execution.
135|It's my understanding that it was the summer project of a couple bored college students.
135|Originally, anyway.
135|An artifact spirit made using the corpse of a centenarian.
135|Tadatsuru and Sister don't get along.
135|And I'm the primary reason that they don't.
135|They fought over ownership of me.
135|So, I'm guessing Kagenui and Tadatsuru fought over you, and Kagenui won?
135|No. I chose her.
135|Ever since then, they've been on bad terms.
135|Though I suppose they were never good friends to begin with.
135|It was just the coup de grâce to their relationship.
135|An outsider like Tadatsuru is not on good terms with many.
135|Maybe Oshino Meme, if I had to pick somebody.
135|Now, why am I bringing this up?
135|Think of the worst-case scenario.
135|At worst, we have to fight Tadatsuru directly and cannot win.
135|Say we can't meet Sister in time, and you and the hostages are about to be killed.
135|If we have no other way out of our predicament, you can hand me, the oddity, over to him,
135|and he would probably accept.
135|He still wants to have me.
135|I believe that's also why Sister had me go with you.
135|Whoa...
135|Whoa!
135|She wears panties like this?
135|This is mature audiences only if it gets turned into PVC.
135|What are you doing?
135|This is punishment for saying dumb things.
135|Do you really think I'd hand you over to save my skin?
135|You've got an awfully low opinion of me.
135|Rightfully, perhaps, since you flipped my skirt.
135|I don't think Kagenui gave you to me for that reason either.
135|I'd say she had faith you could take care of someone as useless as I.
135|Right?
135|Take care of someone flipping the skirts of little girls...
135|I'm trying to say something positive here, so please just drop the skirt thing.
135|You can drop it at any time.
135|You're mistaken if you think dolls know no shame.
135|What a revelation!
135|I was excited by the impression that Ononoki didn't know shame,
135|but the act of hiding her shame behind a frozen expression is way more exciting.
135|If you really want to plan this out before we get there, listen to me.
135|I will go in and distract Tadatsuru.
135|You will sneak in and find the other three.
135|Once you have them, get them out with Unlimited Rulebook.
135|And what will you do then?
135|There's only you, and I suppose the former Heart-Under-Blade.
135|Once you're alone in the shrine with Tadatsuru and without your only fighter, what will you do?
135|Don't worry.
135|I have a secret weapon.
135|Prostration!
135|You should save it.
135|Tadatsuru will not be moved by prostrating yourself.
135|In fact, he'll probably see you as a target for exorcism because you were a vampire at one point,
135|even if you aren't now.
135|Also, don't forget that you have a former vampire girl hiding in your shadow.
135|Even if he unexpectedly lets you go, he will not let Shinobu go.
135|No way, honestly.
135|Oh, I know a way.
135|If we present the old oddity, the former Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade to Tadatsuru,
135|I believe you can save yourself.
135|That's still a negative, Ononoki.
135|I thought as much.
135|If you can't hand me over, you won't hand her over, either.
135|Then we're back where we started.
135|You haven't grown.
135|It's simply impossible to free all the hostages without handing her or me over
135|and without letting harm come to anyone.
135|Recompense is necessary if anybody wants to accomplish anything,
135|just as you lost your humanity in exchange— as recompense—for having abused your immortal powers.
135|If you don't learn from that, you will continue to dodge payment until you lose everything.
135|To be honest, I don't really care for lectures from someone showing off her panties to me.
135|Yes, well, that's entirely your fault.
135|You shouldn't blame others for everything.
135|I guess growing up can also be rather dull.
135|I have a backup plan as well, Devil Brother.
135|A backup plan?
135|I will sneak up on him as best I can, and then blast Tadatsuru with the Unlimited Rulebook.
135|A surprise attack.
135|We can then take our time rescuing the hostages.
135|What would happen to Tadatsuru?
135|How bad would his injuries be?
135|He'd die.
135|I knew it!
135|Why is it bad?
135|He abducted three girls.
135|Being blown to smithereens feels like just punishment.
135|No, we can't do that.
135|It's simply not an option.
135|We'd be murderers.
135|We'd stop being human beings.
135|Murderers are still human beings.
135|Well, I don't dislike your pacifist value system.
135|Values are important.
135|Thanks for telling me.
135|I said thanks for telling me.
135|Well then, Devil Brother.
135|Can you let go of my skirt now?
135|The wind is blowing on my lower extremities. I feel like I'll catch a cold.
135|You can catch colds?
135|You, an artifact spirit and familiar?
135|I can't, but I feel like I will.
135|And on the topic of catching things,
135|I'm beginning to catch a creepy vibe from you.
135|I see.
135|Looking back on it,
135|I don't think I should've let go right then.
135|I think I would've been able to figure out what she was going to do.
135|But I did what she asked me to, and let go.
135|Is that... Tadatsuru?
135|Yeah.
135|Is that marking the passage of time?
135|Time runs out once the box is full of origami?
135|Exactly.
135|You're not as stupid as I thought, Devil Brother.
135|Yes, it's widely known as the exorcist's hourglass.
135|Widely known?
135|I've never heard of it before.
135|It sounds pretty cool, though.
135|We can't tell when it'll be full from here.
135|We should assume that time will run out any minute now.
135|You should go.
135|If you're unwilling to adopt one my schemes, I assume we're going with your straightforward deception.
135|Yes.
135|Very well. I'll move to the back of the shrine.
135|I'll take the three girls which we assume to be inside the shrine and escape using Unlimited Rulebook.
135|That's what you want, right?
135|Yeah.
135|Okay. Let's go.
135|Use your powers of keeping a vacuous conversation alive to distract him.
135|Master.
135|I assume you know this, but you're a lot more important to me than those three hostages.
135|Likewise, it isn't particularly important to me that you continue to lead a human life like a human would.
135|I would not hate to see you turn fully vampiric.
135|I'll suck your blood should you be on the verge of being slain by Tadatsuru.
135|And I'll force you to turn into a vampire and to become immortal so you can fight and win.
135|I don't mind helping out
135|with the fight once I've powered up
135|from your blood.
135|Your final loss of humanity means naught to me.
135|Couldn't care less.
135|I know.
135|Look up, dumbass!
135|I'm pretty sure every dude on Earth is dying to say that.
135|Hey.
135|Or, perhaps:
135|Oh.
135|Araragi Koyomi, I assume?
135|Yes. I'm Araragi Koyomi.
135|You're Teori Tadatsuru, right?
135|Right as opposed to wrong, not left.
135|I'm not someone other than Teori Tadatsuru.
135|Are you alone, Araragi Koyomi?
135|Yes. I didn't bring two or three people, as you can see.
135|I see.
135|How is Yozuru?
135|These mountain roads must be troubling for her, cursed as she is to not walk on the ground.
135|Curs—
135|ed?
135|What kind of curse?
135|A curse that she and I both suffer from.
135|A curse like a childish game to never step foot on the ground.
135|You too?
135|Although the word "curse" entails a bit of a victim fantasy.
135|If you were to ask the caster, he would say he was balancing the books.
135|This is compensation—recompense— for the greed and hubris
135|that Yozuru and I displayed.
135|You mean—
135|No.
135|Stop.
135|I didn't do this to wax philosophical with you.
135|Abducting those dear to you was necessary to exorcise you as an oddity.
135|Yes.
135|I haven't come here to talk to you either.
135|Set the hostages free.
135|They're innocent!
135|Innocent?
135|You should know how untrue that is.
135|You know what those three, Tsukihi in particular, are...
135|No. This isn't right.
135|Hey, Araragi.
135|Can I ask you something?
135|Shoot.
135|Why on Earth am I here?
135|What do you mean?
135|Isn't that obvious?
135|You abducted my violent sister, my foolish sister, and my problematic underclassman!
135|No.
135|I can't be
135|saying this.
135|Don't act like you don't understand that, please!
135|I need to calm down.
135|I've lost
135|so much humanity I can't
135|rely on vampirism anymore.
135|Now set them fr—
135|Yes. Yes.
135|Yes. I did that.
135|I am the bad guy.
135|Yet, Araragi. I still do not understand.
135|Why am I here?
135|Stop playing—
135|I don't understand.
135|I don't understand at all.
135|Don't understand what?
135|What do you mean?
135|You've come here to exorcise me.
135|That's all.
135|Right?!
135|Yes.
135|But I still don't understand.
135|What?!
135|The reason why I will exorcise you.
135|I am an exorcist, yes.
135|I specialize in immortal oddities.
135|I'm a hermit, an outlaw among outlaws, inspired by grudges and not by ideals.
135|Oshino's agreement does not bind me.
135|Only my aesthetics mesh with society.
135|I would argue that I am the perfect cast to stand opposite you, that exceptional existence.
135|Yes, I was cast.
135|I strongly feel that I was cast.
135|I feel like I was chosen as the perfect actor to play this role opposite you.
135|And not just I.
135|Yozuru as well...
135|Yotsugi too.
135|And what about you, Araragi?
135|Did you have a choice?
135|Were you not compelled to be where you are now?
135|I was, at the very least.
135|Compelled?!
135|Are you telling me you were compelled to abduct my loved ones?
135|And are you not rightfully wrathful?
135|Wrathful because your role demands it?
135|How are we different?
135|We are both playing our role.
135|Our positions are different, as are our roles.
135|Ad-libbing is not permitted.
135|Araragi. Find Oshino.
135|He is not being manipulated—he stands outside the cast.
135|He can move to the center and restore balance to the plot.
135|Only he can.
135|I've looked for him everywhere.
135|By the way, Tadatsuru.
135|You seem to be a friend of Oshino's.
135|Do you know where he is?
135|I would not be here if I knew.
135|I would not have had to do this.
135|Would not have had to do what is natural.
135|Would not have had to follow my nature.
135|Well then. Shall we begin?
135|Or, well, shall we end it?
135|Wait, Tadatsuru. Listen to—
135|I can wait no longer.
135|I am sick of it.
135|I will not be deployed like a pawn.
135|I will not be moved like a pawn or work like a pawn.
135|I am sick of it.
135|I will not push you towards being a vampire.
135|Shrine of the Polar Snake
135|Araragi. Seek Oshino.
135|If you cannot do that, you must follow your nature.
135|You must give up what you have.
135|Tadatsuru, I'm not that bright.
135|Don't speak in riddles.
135|If you want me to do something, please tell it to me straight.
135|I don't want you to do anything
135|because you're human.
135|The one I wish to ask something of
135|is you.
135|Please. Make it quick.
135|Do it for
135|me.
135|Do it for me.
135|Actually, I have one more thing to ask.
135|I would like to be permitted this one wish.
135|You've become embarrassed of your trademark phrase I believe.
135|Let me hear it one last time.
135|I loved you when you were so emotionless, yet trying to show a wealth of emotion in that phrase.
135|Understood.
135|Unlimited Rulebook,
135|I said with a posed look.
135|I killed him.
135|I hit him with maximum power from close range.
135|Don't worry about it.
135|I did this against your orders.
135|You told me not to do it, but I disobeyed and did it anyway.
135|Wha—
135|No, no, Devil Brother.
135|I did not do this to protect you or help you.
135|I'm sure there would have been ways to do it without killing him.
135|I killed him anyway
135|because I am a monster.
135|Ononoki...
135|Don't be like me, Devil Brother.
135|Once a human turns into a monster,
135|it's all over.
135|As for the post-credits sequence or the punch line...
135|Karen, Tsukihi, and Kanbaru were all found tucked away inside the shrine box.
135|Incidentally, I was once tucked away by Kagenui as well,
135|and in much the same way those three were beautifully sleeping inside.
135|I take ye were successful?
135|Yes.
135|I cannae dae physical work.
135|That's good.
135|It looks like the sun didn't disintegrate you.
135|You can still walk in sunlight.
135|Looking back on it, I believe this story only existed
135|to let me bear witness to the adorable pet doll Ononoki Yotsugi
135|killing a human being due to her own inhumanity.
135|A story that changed my impression of her, since, despite my conscious feelings about her,
135|I find myself unable to fight off my basic biological disgust.
135|I played along
135|An act, charade, deception
135|I believe the darkness meant for a rift to be opened between us
135|after we had so nonchalantly become acquainted.
135|First was Hachikuji Mayoi.
135|Then came Sengoku Nadeko.
135|Now it has taken Ononoki Yotsugi from me.
135|Tadatsuru did not oppose his sacrifice.
135|He quite casually went with the flow.
135|This is what happened.
135|Here. It's your Valentine's Day chocolate!
135|How is it? Is it good?
135|Say, is it good?
135|Right.
135|Today is Valentine's Day.
135|Yes. It's delicious.
135|Yay.
135|Come on in.
135|There's a lot more.
135|A lot more, huh?
135|I've got something to tell you, Senjougahara.
135|Explaining World History
135|Japanese
135|So, what's so problematic about not being able to see yourself in a mirror?
135|A lot, I'd say.
135|Won't it be really weird if people notice?
135|I don't think it's a big deal.
135|Even if you can't see yourself in a mirror, I can still see you.
135|That said, you must still think about what happens now.
135|Have you talked to Hanekawa yet?
135|I wouldn't go to her before you.
135|I'm not even sure what to say.
135|I don't even know for sure if it's permanent.
135|Even if Shinobu doesn't suck my blood,
135|the balance could be destroyed at the slightest provocation.
135|You don't trust a specialist's diagnosis?
135|Perhaps you need a second opinion then.
135|I don't trust my own life.
135|Explaining World History
135|Japanese
135|I don't know how long my life will remain like it is now.
135|That's all I know.
135|Live life in the present, huh...?
135|Y'know, Araragi.
135|Kaiki...
135|Kaiki used to say things like that to seem cool.
135|He never lived with the expectation of permanence among his friendships.
135|Perhaps he didn't want his life to calm down.
135|Now, I have to admit I found it to be a cool perspective on life.
135|But if that's the sort of thing that's cool, then I don't think being cool is worth it.
135|Hanekawa would say the same, wouldn't she?
135|She stopped telling you to follow your nature so much, didn't she?
135|That reminds me.
135|I wonder what she's doing these days.
135|Who knows?
135|I'd say she's probably still looking for Oshino.
135|It seems like she's pursuing some of her own angles too.
135|Tadatsuru told me to find Oshino too.
135|Perhaps I should talk to Hanekawa a—
135|—bout that.
135|So I was thinking about dropping by on the way home.
135|I see.
135|I have something to ask of you, then.
135|Do it tomorrow.
135|Hey.
135|Karen. Tsukihi.
135|What are you doing?
135|Your sisters won me from the crane game.
135|Tsukihi is a lot better
135|at it than you.
135|She only needed three coins.
135|That's not what I mean.
135|These past events were designed to drive a wedge between us.
135|Gaen and Sister decided that it was crucial to rebel against it.
135|I was told to stay closer to you and have more contact with you until this town has found balance.
135|We'll be seeing a lot more of each other.
135|You gotta be kidding me!
135|What are you doing, Brother?
135|Please stop talking to the doll I won by using my own money and my own skill.
135|Exactly.
135|Jeez, you'll never grow into an adult, will you?
135|How pathetic.
135|And so my stressful days were to continue for a while longer.
135|Let go!
135|Possesstory
135|Yotsugi Doll
135|Fin
135|.
135|Goodnight
135|.
135|How much longer, do you think,
135|can we live our ordinary lives like this?
135|Perhaps that thought alone
135|invites the end of it
135|I blame my misfortune on little things in life
135|instead of taking a step forward
135|You had to be gone from my life
135|before I started treasuring my days
135|I always tell myself that my time is limited,
135|but could never confess my love
135|Even if our days together are over,
135|I will find happiness again
135|Now I know that my time is limited,
135|and so I want to confess my love
136|It's Just A Cat-And-Mouse Game.
136|Oh, you're pretty late, Araragi-senpai.
136|My beloved Araragi-senpai, I was getting tired of waiting for you.
136|Hey, Ougi-chan...
136|Please Push
136|In a place like this, at this time, it's dangerous for a high school girl to be out by herself.
136|You have some timing.
136|I'll walk you home.
136|In one hop like you did right now, Araragi-senpai?
136|I think I'll pass. I don't have a home anyway.
136|Push-Button Signal
136|Oh, no, that's wrong.
136|It's
136|Completely
136|Different.
136|It
136|Looks
136|Like
136|You're
136|In
136|A
136|Hurry
136|As
136|Well,
136|Araragi
136|-senpai
136|I just thought, since Araragi-senpai is heading into a battle,
136|I should give him some words of encouragement.
136|So I've been waiting here since morning.
136|Since morning?
136|doki doki no yuuyami ni
136|Under the breathtaking twilight

136|The sparkling stars flutter

136|We cannot be sure that the things we see

136|The sparkling stars flutter
136|Oh? I don't see her around.
136|What happened to your usual young blonde lolita slave?
136|It's weird.
136|You can't do anything without her according to the setting, right, Araragi-senpai?
136|I don't know if that was true so much in the past...
136|But that's true now. That's exactly what the setting is.
136|I'm not embarrassed about it, though.
136|It's good to be able to rely on others' powers.
136|You relied on them too much, didn't you? My uncle said it all the time.
136|Let's see... What was it?
136|You know, the line he always said like his signature line.
136|Um, well, you know...
136|What was it?
136|That, that, that, that...
136|I'm Sure She Remembers.
136|"People can't help people. I won't help you. All you can do is help yourself, Araragi-kun."
136|That was it, right?
136|Oh, right, right. That's it.
136|I wonder why I forgot it?
136|I'm too absent-minded, huh? That's my uncle's signature line.
136|Right. It's your uncle's signature line. Not mine.
136|That's why I have no regrets. To a surprising degree.
136|"Oh no. I was careless. I should have thought it through and acted more carefully."
136|I don't think things like that now.
136|Yeah. Araragi-senpai probably would've acted the same even if he knew.
136|That's why, that is.
136|What do you mean "That's why"?
136|"That's
136|Why"
136|Is
136|"That's
136|Why."
136|There
136|Is
136|No
136|More
136|Meaning
136|To
136|It
136|Than
136|"That's
136|Why."
136|In the end, why I'm here doing this,
136|is because, I think, I'm attracted to how you're like this, Araragi-senpai.
136|I don't know how to put it exactly, but I think I like being mean to you.
136|You like lean what?
136|Well, I'm telling you, all sorts of things.
136|Being mean to all sorts of things that don't like it.
136|And you know, I don't like things that are mean to me.
136|You could say I like to be fair, to have the scale balanced.
136|I want things to be proper. Proper.
136|Push-Button Signal
136|Well, really, you still rely on other people's power even now, Araragi-senpai.
136|Another person, a little girl, wasn't it? A little girl.
136|Borrowing the powers of a small child, it's pathetic.
136|Yeah, you're probably right. It's probably pathetic.
136|But you just saw it for yourself. She isn't a normal child.
136|I know. I've been told before.
136|Please Wait
136|Did I tell her?
136|Oh, I told her.
136|Push-Button Signal
136|Then why did she say "a small child" at first?
136|Well, see you later.
136|You've matured, Araragi-senpai. Don't you think so?
136|Haven't you matured quite a bit these past few months?
136|You wouldn't have been able to stay cool and collected like this before, right?
136|You know, back during spring break, when you thought you would never be human again.
136|Didn't you lock yourself in the gym's storage closet and cry and stuff?
136|That you can stay cool like this now, it's like...
136|Does it mean you've matured, through the cost of many things, and through losing many things?
136|Maybe so.
136|But you know, Ougi-chan.
136|That being said, I can't think of failures, misfortunes, sacrifices, and much sadness, as "good things."
136|You shouldn't either.
136|If anything, I'd like to mature by succeeding. That's natural.
136|Well, that girl earlier has to be
136|the mastermind, the final boss troubling devil boy, that asked Tadatsuru to exterminate aberrations.
136|Eh? What was that, Ononoki-chan?
136|No, I didn't say anything. I was just predicting random things.
136|Even if they were true, I wouldn't know the motive.
136|Oh wait. She did say the motive, for things to be proper.
136|But what does it mean to be proper?
136|What is correct?
136|I'm an aberration, a shikigami, a corpse, and a tsukumo-gami.
136|With just this, I'm not proper, huh?
136|I'm playing around, using every trick in the book to stay alive. Or rather, to stay dead.
136|But that just means I'm extreme in my actions.
136|And that humans are more or less the same way.
136|Do you want to hear a story about Tadatsuru?
136|To be honest, I don't.
136|Eh... Even though he kidnapped three people close to you, Devil-chan?
136|Yeah. The ideal ending here is
136|that I get the three of them back and off this mountain without Tadatsuru noticing.
136|Indeed, that's the best outcome.
136|But that's just an idea. It won't solve anything if we don't know how to do it.
136|It's Just A Cat-And-Mouse Game.
136|That's why you have to "convince" him like usual, Devil-chan.
136|Tadatsuru is indeed the same as Onee-chan in that he specializes in immortal aberrations,
136|but their definitions of immortal aberrations are a little different.
136|Onee-chan specializes in the immortal, but still living aberrations.
136|Tadatsuru primarily deals with dead aberrations.
136|That's the reason why they're opposites.
136|The life of a lifeless doll, Tadatsuru loves that.
136|I, as an aberration, am artificial.
136|The one who supposedly planned the project, Gaen-san...
136|Those that were involved in the production were Onee-chan, Kagenui Yozuru, Kaiki Deishu...
136|and then add Oshino Meme and Teori Tadatsuru.
136|Well, in the beginning, it was supposed to be something like
136|a summer research project by bored college students.
136|The creation of an artificial tsukomo-gami using the corpse of a human that lived to the age of a hundred.
136|How Tadatsuru and Onee-chan don't get along, how they fight to this day...
136|I'm the reason why they're quarreling in the first place.
136|They were fighting for ownership of the shikigami. For me.
136|I see... But to summarize, in the end,
136|Kagenui-san and Tadatsuru fought for your ownership,
136|and Kagenui-san got you.
136|No. I chose her.
136|Ever since, the discord between Onee-chan and Tadatsuru has continued.
136|It wasn't like they were close friends to begin with, but that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
136|Well, someone who gets along with a stray like Tadatsuru is hard to find.
136|Oshino Meme is probably the only one.
136|The reason that I started talking about this, Devil-chan, is that in the worst-case scenario...
136|In the worst-case scenario...
136|In other words, you face Tadatsuru, but you're no match for him,
136|Onee-chan doesn't make it in time, the hostages are about to be killed,
136|and Devil-chan is also about to be killed...
136|If there is no other way,
136|If you can't do anything about it,
136|If you make a deal with him to hand me, an aberration, over to him,
136|I'm sure Tadatsuru will accept. That's what I wanted to say.
136|Even now, he still wants me.
136|I'm sure that's why Onee-chan lent me to you, Devil-chan.
136|Wow.
136|Wow, Ononoki-chan, these are the kind of panties you wear? They really don't match your character!
136|What are you doing, Devil-chan?
136|Those that say stupid things get stupid things done to them.
136|There's no way I value my life so much that I would offer you up, Ononoki-chan.
136|It'll trouble me if you think of me like that.
136|I'm troubled if you lift my skirt, though.
136|That wasn't the reason why Kagenui-san lent you to me, Ononoki-chan.
136|I'm sure she lent you to me because, if it's you, you can take care of a useless guy like me.
136|Isn't that right?
136|When I'm entrusted to someone who would flip a little girl's skirt, though...
136|No, I'm saying something good here, so don't talk about how I flip skirts.
136|If you want that, let me go.
136|If you think I have no sense of shame because I'm a doll, you're mistaken.
136|How can this be. I was turned on by how Ononoki-chan didn't seem to have a sense of shame, but...
136|No, this expression that appears to have no sense of shame
136|when she's actually feeling it can be another turn-on!
136|If I were to think up something resembling a plan, this is how it would go, Ononoki-chan.
136|I'm going to be the decoy and keep Tadatsuru's attention.
136|Ononoki-chan, you wait for that and rescue them.
136|After you rescue them, use Unlimited Rulebook to get away. I don't care where.
136|So according to that plan, what will you do afterwards, Devil-chan?
136|Alone. With one other if you count the former Heart-under-blade,
136|but you'll be left at the shrine with Tadatsuru without me, in other words, the combat support.
136|What'll you do?
136|It's fine. I have a secret plan: the grovel.
136|You should keep that a secret forever.
136|Tadatsuru won't forgive just because you grovel.
136|According to Tadatsuru, even if you aren't a vampire right now, Devil-chan,
136|you're a target if you turn into a vampire even once.
136|Besides, no matter how much you grovel,
136|don't forget that in your shadow is a little girl that used to be a vampire.
136|With a lucky shot, a one-in-a-million chance, you'll be forgiven. But not Shinobu-neesan.
136|No way, no how.
136|Oh, there may actually be a way.
136|By offering someone that was once an aberration,
136|someone once known as Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, he might ignore you.
136|The reverse of that pattern may be a chance, but that'll never happen, Ononoki-chan.
136|Figures. You weren't willing to offer me up, so there's no way you would do it to Shinobu-neesan.
136|However, what you're saying hasn't changed from before, Devil-chan.
136|You haven't grown into an adult at all.
136|Coming out safely with all three hostages, and even without giving up me or Shinobu-neesan,
136|and for you to be come out safe and sound as well...
136|That's a reckless thought.
136|Nothing can be done without needing to pay something in return, right?
136|As payment for relying too much on your vampire power,
136|in other words, as compensation, you lost your "humanity."
136|If you don't learn from that, you'll always put a bill on your tab
136|and in the end you'll lose everything.
136|There's something about how you say that while showing me your panties.
136|I think it's 100 percent your fault I'm showing you my panties, Devil-chan.
136|It's not good to blame others.
136|Well, if you grew completely into an adult it would be boring.
136|Devil-chan, if that's the case, I can suggest another plan.
136|Another plan?
136|We get close to Tadatsuru without him noticing and then I slam Unlimited Rulebook into him.
136|An ambush.
136|Then we can take our time saving the three hostages.
136|In that case, what happens to Tadatsuru? Will he just get hurt?
136|He will die.
136|Of course he does!
136|No? He's a guy who kidnaps girls, though.
136|I feel it's only right that he gets blown to bits.
136|No... That's no good. No good, and impossible.
136|You'd murder someone. If you did that, you would really stop being human.
136|Even if they kill people, people are people.
136|Well, I can't say I hate peaceful ideals like that, and it's something necessary.
136|It was good that I heard that.
136|I said it was good that I heard that.
136|Now, Devil-chan. Can you let go of my skirt already?
136|My bottom half is getting cold, and I'm scared I'll get sick.
136|You'll catch a cold? The tsukumo-gami and shikigami Ononoki-chan will?
136|I wouldn't, but I feel like I'm going to.
136|If you ask if I'm pulling or not, I'm starting to mentally pull away from you, Devil-chan,
136|for having my skirt like this the whole time.
136|I see.
136|Later, I would realize I shouldn't have let go of her right then.
136|The things Ononoki-chan will go on to do from here.
136|I would have understood if I had given it some thought.
136|But I still listened to Ononoki-chan and let her go.
136|That's Tadatsuru?
136|Yeah.
136|I see...
136|Could it be that he's counting time like that?
136|Like, if the offering box gets filled, we're out of time?
136|How'd you figure that out? You're pretty sharp, devil boy.
136|Right, that's one of the laws of sines, the origami clock.
136|The Laws Of Sines...
136|It Means Things Like That In This World?
136|That Sounds Kinda Awesome...
136|I can't tell when the box will be full from here.
136|We should assume we'll be out of time any moment now.
136|It would probably be better if we hurry up.
136|Since you're not going to use any of the plans I suggested,
136|that means you're going with that simple decoy plan, right?
136|That's my intention.
136|Then I'll swing around to the back side of the shrine.
136|I'll look for the three girls who are probably inside,
136|grab them, and book it out of there with Unlimited Rulebook. That's fine, right?
136|Yeah, that's right.
136|Then it's time to start the operation, Devil-chan.
136|Devil-chan, use your chit-chat skill to keep Tadatsuru's attention.
136|Master.
136|Let me tell you this.
136|I cherish you much more than those three who were kidnapped, master.
136|Besides, I don't really care if you lead a normal life as a human, master.
136|I don't hate the thought of you turning into a vampire either, master.
136|If you're about to be killed by Tadatsuru, I'll suck your blood at that instant, master.
136|I will make you into a vampire, make you immortal, make you fight him, and make you win, master.
136|Of Course, I Can Just Fight Him Myself
136|After Sucking Your Blood
136|And Powering Up
136|I don't care if you lose a bit more of your humanity by doing so.
136|At all.
136|Understood.
136|Where are you looking? I'm over here!
136|This is a line any man would want to say at least once.
136|Hey... Well, I guess finally, hey.
136|You're... Araragi Koyomi-kun right?
136|Yeah, that's right. I'm Araragi Koyomi.
136|You're Teori Tadatsuru... Is that right?
136|Asking if you're right or wrong, of course you're right.
136|That it would be wrong for me to be Teori Tadatsuru, that's pretty unthinkable.
136|Are you alone, Araragi Koyomi-kun?
136|Yeah. As you can tell, there aren't two or three people here.
136|I see. Is Yozuru doing well?
136|It must be hard for her to go up this mountain, with her curse forbidding her from walking on the ground.
136|A curse, what do you... mean...
136|by Kagenui-san's curse?
136|Yozuru and I have a curse like that placed upon us.
136|A childish curse that won't let us walk on the ground for the rest of our lives.
136|You too?
136|Yeah, but the word "curse" is just a strong way of saying "paranoia."
136|According to the one that cast the curse on us, it's just paying off our tabs.
136|It's the cost Yozuru and I paid to reach something far away, without knowing our place in this world.
136|Something you'd call compensation.
136|That's...
136|No, wrong. That's not it.
136|I didn't do this to have a conversation with you.
136|Kidnapping the people close to you was something I did to eliminate you, an aberration.
136|Oh, that's right... It's not like I came here to talk things out with you either.
136|I'd like you to return the hostages. They have nothing to do with this, right?
136|Nothing to do with this? Come on now, you know that isn't the case at all.
136|Because those girls you hold dear, especially the one called Tsukihi...
136|No, wrong. This isn't it either.
136|Hey, Araragi-kun. Do you mind if I ask you one thing?
136|What is it?
136|Why in the world am I here?
136|What do you mean? Why are you here? That... that's obvious.
136|You took my violent little sister, my worrisome little sister,
136|No Good.
136|and my troublesome underclassman, and you kidnapped them.
136|It's No Good To
136|Say Something Like This.
136|I'd like you to stop acting dumb and feigning innocence.
136|Calm Down.
136|I'm already not-human to the point that I can't rely
136|on my vampire power, right?
136|Hurry up and let them g—
136|Oh, right, right...
136|Right... Me. I'm the culprit.
136|However, Araragi-kun. I still don't understand. Why in the world am I here?
136|What?!
136|I don't know. I don't understand. I can't.
136|What do you mean, you don't know? How don't you know?
136|You're here to exterminate me. That's it. Isn't that it?
136|That's right.
136|But I don't know.
136|What?!
136|Why I would exterminate you.
136|It's true that I am a specialist.
136|A specialist who specializes in immortal aberrations. A stray specialist.
136|More of an outlaw than the outlaws, with no ideals and acting on grudges.
136|The acknowledgment of your harmlessness doesn't work, and I still have a full sense of aesthetics.
136|Araragi-kun, I'm the perfect person to be cast against you.
136|I'm the best character to cast.
136|Right. Cast.
136|I can't shake the feeling that someone cast me into this role.
136|I feel like I was chosen for this role simply because I'm the best person to fight with you here and now.
136|No, not just me. Yozuru, and Yotsugi too.
136|Araragi-kun, don't you feel like that?
136|Aren't you here because you "have no choice?" Because you were forced?
136|That's how I am, at least.
136|What do you mean I have no choice? Are you saying you had no choice but to kidnap people precious to me?
136|Even that anger. Aren't you getting angry because you're supposed to?
136|Aren't you angry just because it fits your role?
136|What is the difference between you and me? We're both doing what we're supposed to.
136|Both of us, in the situation we're in, with the roles we've been given.
136|We are not allowed to ad lib.
136|Araragi-kun, look for Oshino.
136|I'm sure that he will,
136|without being used by anyone, and outside of all this casting,
136|be the referee for this story, neutrally, and with a nice balance.
136|That's something only he can do.
136|I've already looked far and wide for Oshino.
136|By the way, Tadatsuru. I hear you're a friend of Oshino's.
136|Do you perchance know where Oshino is right now?
136|If I knew, I wouldn't be in a place like this.
136|I wouldn't have had to do something like this. I wouldn't have had to do something this proper.
136|I wouldn't have had to be proper.
136|Okay, shall we start now? Or end, rather.
136|Tadatsuru, wait. Listen to me.
136|I can't wait anymore. I'm sick of all of this.
136|Positioned like a pawn, moved around like a pawn, and worked like a pawn...
136|I'm sick of it already.
136|I don't want to help turn you into a vampire.
136|Shirahebi Shrine
136|North
136|Shirahebi Shrine
136|North
136|Araragi-kun, find Oshino.
136|If you can't do that, you have no choice but to "become proper."
136|You can only gain and lose.
136|Tadatsuru... I'm dense. I don't get it when you tell me like that.
136|If there's something you want to ask me to do, please ask me clearly.
136|I won't ask you for anything. Because you're human...
136|What I ask for is, right, you.
136|I beg you, simply do this with tenaciousness.
136|Human
136|Compassion
136|Do it with human tenderness.
136|Oh, I'd like to ask for something extra. I'd like to make my once-in-a-lifetime wish for goodness's sake.
136|I hear you've gotten embarrassed and won't say that line lately.
136|But I'd like to hear it one last time.
136|I loved it.
136|How your expressionless self said that line to try to be full of it.
136|Roger.
136|Unlimited Rulebook.
136|I said with a posed look.
136|I killed him.
136|At max power, I slammed into him at close range.
136|You don't need to worry about it, Devil-chan. I did this on my own.
136|You told me not to do it, Devil-chan, but I went against you and did it on my own.
136|What—
136|That's wrong, devil boy.
136|I'm sure if the intention was to protect or save, there was a way to spare him.
136|Yet I still killed him...
136|Because I'm a monster.
136|Ononoki-chan...
136|Don't end up like this, Devil-chan.
136|When a human's story ends as a monster story,
136|their humanity ends.
136|What you'd call an epilogue, or the punch line for this episode.
136|Karen, Tsukihi, and Kanbaru were all folded up inside the offering box.
136|It was similar to how I had once been folded up by Kagenui-san,
136|neatly folded up and put to sleep in the offering box.
136|You did it?
136|Yeah.
136|I can't handle power jobs.
136|Good for you, devil boy.
136|For the time being I guess your body won't disappear in the sunlight, Devil-chan.
136|You have a body that can still walk under the sun's light.
136|What kind of a story was this incident?
136|I think it was a story meant for me to see
136|the cute doll called Ononoki Yotsugi murder a human as a monster.
136|A story where I can understand in my head, but I can't help but see her in a different light, feeling instinctive disgust.
136|Wishy-Washy, And Abstract
136|Somewhat Manipulated, Using Every Trick In The Book
136|The enemy's objective must have been to cause a split
136|between me and Ononoki Yotsugi, as we had come to have a reasonable amount of friendship.
136|The objective of the "darkness."
136|Following Hachikuji Mayoi and Sengoku Nadeko, it took Ononoki Yotsugi away from me.
136|Tadatsuru did not fight his end.
136|He simply followed his plan recklessly.
136|That's what it all meant.
136|Here, this is your Valentine's Day chocolate.
136|How is it? Tasty? Tasty-wasty? Is it tasty?
136|That's right. Today is Valentine's Day.
136|Yeah, it's tasty.
136|Yay!
136|Come in, come in. I still have plenty of chocolate.
136|Plenty more, huh?
136|Actually, Senjougahara.
136|I see.
136|So, how is it troubling if you can never see yourself in the mirror again?
136|How, you ask... Well, I guess it'll be bad when people notice?
136|If that's it, then, well, it's fine.
136|Even if a mirror doesn't show you, Araragi-kun will continue to appear in my eyes.
136|Well, that being said, you need to think about what you're going to do moving forward.
136|You've talked to Hanekawa-san about this, right?
136|I wouldn't ask her before asking you, of course.
136|Or rather, I don't know what to tell her...
136|Even if it's just not being able to see myself in a mirror for now, I don't know if I'll stay like this forever.
136|Even If I Don't Let
136|Shinobu Suck My Blood
136|Even If I Don't Let
136|Shinobu Suck My Blood
136|Some Other Catalyst Might Break The Balance
136|You don't think a specialist's analysis is reliable? Then why don't you get a second opinion?
136|No, the unreliable thing is how I live my life.
136|World History
136|Revised Japanese
136|My normal life, the life I can live doing what I've always done.
136|I don't know how long that's going to last. That's the one thing I can say for sure.
136|The life you can spend doing what you've always done, huh?
136|You know, Araragi-kun. Kaiki was...
136|Kaiki was a guy that showed off by saying things like that.
136|A peaceful everyday life, how relationships will continue forever, these are things he never thought about.
136|You could say he didn't like his life to show signs of living.
136|Well, I was mistaken to think a stance like that was cool.
136|But if something like that is cool, I think you're fine being uncool, Araragi-kun.
136|Wouldn't Hanekawa-san say the same thing now?
136|She doesn't say "you should be proper" as much as she used to, right?
136|Come to think of it... I wonder what Hanekawa is doing today?
136|Who knows?
136|She's probably still looking for Oshino-san.
136|It seems like there are circumstances only she knows about.
136|Look for Oshino... Tadatsuru was saying something about that too.
136|Maybe that lead is something I should also...
136|talk to Hanekawa about.
136|So I was thinking about going to see and talk to her on the way home.
136|I see. Then I have a favor to ask, Araragi-kun.
136|Please do that tomorrow.
136|Hey, Karen-chan, Tsukihi-chan!
136|What are you doing?
136|I was sitting inside the crane game, and your little sisters got me.
136|Compared To You, Devil-chan,
136|Tsukihi-chan Has Quite A Bit More Skill.
136|She Got Me With Just Three Coins.
136|No, that's not what I meant.
136|The objective of this incident was to make a split in our relationship.
136|Gaen-san and Onee-chan decided that if that's the case, we need to avoid it.
136|Until this town stabilizes, they told me to stick with you.
136|Stay by your side and get even more close and intimate.
136|Therefore, I'll be in your care for a while.
136|Wait.
136|Wait, damn you! You've got to be joking!
136|What are you doing, Onii-chan? Stop talking to the doll I won with my own skill and my own money.
136|That's right, Nii-chan.
136|Sheesh, you're really just a kid who'll never grow up into an adult.
136|Yeah, really!
136|Serves you right.
136|What's this? It seems these noisy days will continue on for just a bit longer.
136|Tsukimonogatari
136|Yotsugi Doll
136|Good Night
136|The End
136|itsumo doori no atarimae no hibi wo
136|These normal, ordinary days...
136|itsumade konna fuu ni sugoserundarou
136|I wonder how long we can continue passing our time like this
136|sonna koto kangaeta shunkan kara
136|From the moment I thought about that
136|owari ha hajimarikakechatteru no kana
136|I wondered if the end had already begun
136|yoku ataru uranai toka
136|Let’s blame it on my spot-on fortunes
136|haneta kami no sei ni shite
136|Or on my curled up hair

136|But I’m frozen in place again today, unable to change
136|kimi no inai sonna sekai ni natte hajimete
136|This is starting to become a world where you don't exist
136|kyou to iu hi wo koukai suru nante iya da
136|I don’t want to grow to regret the day called “today”
136|ima shika nai itsudatte
136|There’s nothing but right now, and even though
136|shitteta noni kyou mo ienakute
136|I’ve always known that, I wasn’t able to say anything today
136|anna hibi ni mou nido to modorenai toshitemo
136|Even if we can never go back to those days
136|nee nando demo atarashiku hajimetai
136|Listen, I want to start things from the beginning, over and over again
136|ima shika nai itsudatte
136|There’s nothing but right now
136|shitteru kara kyou ha iitakute
136|Even though I’ve always known that, I want to tell you today
